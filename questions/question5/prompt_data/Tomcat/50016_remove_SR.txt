Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
In your bug reports, it is essential to provide clear and informative statements for the following categories:
- **Observed Behavior (OB):** This section should describe the relevant software behavior, actions, output, or results. Avoid vague statements like "the system does not work."
- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like "should...", "expect...", or "hope...". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.
- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like "to reproduce," "steps to reproduce," or "follow these steps."
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '50016', 'title': 'Bug 50016bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods', 'description': 'Bug 50016bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods Created attachment 26089 [details]improve division of responsibility for isUserInRole and login/logout methodsThere are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility.1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong.In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role. ', 'OB': 'If the user is not in the mapped role the original role is tested. However,(a). The implementation of the new login and logout methods are excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. In particular, checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/pw login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed. ', 'EB': 'So to be reasonably amenable to a jacc implementation Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and if possible the servlet name to the wrapper. (b) if there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. A user that logs in and is in role A and not B should be able to test in Sis in Afalseis in BtrueThe current implementation reports true for both A and B.2. Both should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The authenticator also ought to be able to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results. ', 'SR': ''}
