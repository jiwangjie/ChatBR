Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
In your bug reports, it is essential to provide clear and informative statements for the following categories:
- **Observed Behavior (OB):** This section should describe the relevant software behavior, actions, output, or results. Avoid vague statements like "the system does not work."
- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like "should...", "expect...", or "hope...". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.
- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like "to reproduce," "steps to reproduce," or "follow these steps."
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '121974', 'title': "Bug 121974Can't evaluate global expressions when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop", 'description': 'Bug 121974Can\'t evaluate global expressions when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop For global expressions, such as {params["p1"]},{new DateTime()}, it should always be available and evaluatable within the birt scripting environment.Currently, Dte scriptExpresson has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, ONEACHROW. ', 'OB': 'But in fact BEFOREFIRSTROW only works when the cursor is just to enter the first row, and AFTERLASTROW only works when cursor is just to leave the last row. Once the iteration is finished, both type won\'t work anymore. A "QueryResults or its iterator has been closed" DataException will be thrown out if you try to evaluate these expressions.But actually, these global expressions is nothing to do with the data row iteration. Also, current BEFOREFIRSTROW/AFTERLASTROW name is misleading, better change to ONSTARTROW, ONENDROW or others which are more clarified.This bug currently blocks chart to evaluate those nondatarow expressions(i.e. expressions from title url action) which are not within a datarow iteration(Chart need to evaluate these expreesions from action after data binding).
