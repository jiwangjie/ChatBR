<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '131649', 'title': 'Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table', 'description': 'Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table This design uses a 2level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this:row["FIRSTNAME"] + " " + row["LASTNAME"] + " / " + row["OFFICECODE"]However this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on "COUNTRY" is to insertrows[0]["COUNTRY"]into the expression.The first index (an integer) to the "rows" array is the 0based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table etc.). ', 'OB': '', 'EB': '', 'SR': 'Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). To do this double click on the inner list\'s Data Item to edit its expression. Click on "Available Data Sets", choose data set "offices", then double click on column "COUNTRY". '}
