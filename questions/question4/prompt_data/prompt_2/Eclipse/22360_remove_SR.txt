', 'OB': 'I get MissingResourceException when I am trying to create FontRegistry instancefor my application as follows:com.company.product.MyClasspublic void createFontRegistry(){FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry("com.company.product.fonts");}where I do have a file fonts.properties in my com/company/product/folder.However, if I try this instead:com.company.product.MyClasspublic void createFontRegistry(){ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(("com.company.product.fonts");}There is no exception.Moreover, if I create a complete copy of the FontRegsitry class in mycom.company.product packagethen it works.My guess isit is a bug in the FontRegistry. It tries to load the fontsresource bundle, but the FontRegistry\'s class loader is used to do that (seereadResourceBundle(String) FontRegistry method).
