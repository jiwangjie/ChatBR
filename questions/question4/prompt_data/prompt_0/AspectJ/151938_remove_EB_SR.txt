Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
In your bug reports, it is essential to provide clear and informative statements for the following categories:
- **Observed Behavior (OB):** This section should describe the relevant software behavior, actions, output, or results. Avoid vague statements like "the system does not work."
- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like "should...", "expect...", or "hope...". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.
- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like "to reproduce," "steps to reproduce," or "follow these steps."
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '151938', 'title': 'Bug 151938Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully', 'description': 'Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode.This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...) ', 'OB': "If you start a java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, it chokes badly: it tries to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits massive amounts of bytecode. If the script is wrapped twice, it can generate a duplicate. ", 'EB': '', 'SR': ''}
