Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
In your bug reports, it is essential to provide clear and informative statements for the following categories:
- **Observed Behavior (OB):** This section should describe the relevant software behavior, actions, output, or results. Avoid vague statements like "the system does not work."
- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like "should...", "expect...", or "hope...". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.
- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like "to reproduce," "steps to reproduce," or "follow these steps."
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '49503', 'title': 'Bug 49503Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()', 'description': 'Bug 49503Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start() Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well.In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started.IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.To reproduce:1. The first instance starts successfully. ', 'OB': '[1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.htmlDowngradinguserWhen running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80).I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.3. Actual behaviour:The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called.The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await(). ', 'EB': 'Expected behaviour:I would expect that in StandardServiceinitInternal() the connector.init() call fails, because it cannot bind to the port.The exception from connector.init() is caught there and, if EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown, then caught in Catalinaload() and then rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.4.
