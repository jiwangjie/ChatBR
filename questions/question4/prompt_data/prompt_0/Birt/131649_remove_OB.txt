Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
In your bug reports, it is essential to provide clear and informative statements for the following categories:
- **Observed Behavior (OB):** This section should describe the relevant software behavior, actions, output, or results. Avoid vague statements like "the system does not work."
- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like "should...", "expect...", or "hope...". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.
- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like "to reproduce," "steps to reproduce," or "follow these steps."
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '131649', 'title': 'Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table', 'description': 'Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table This design uses a 2level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this:row["FIRSTNAME"] + " " + row["LASTNAME"] + " / " + row["OFFICECODE"]However this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on "COUNTRY" is to insertrows[0]["COUNTRY"]into the expression.The first index (an integer) to the "rows" array is the 0based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table etc.). ', 'OB': '', 'EB': 'The report designer should figure out the correct index number by looking at the nesting levels of all tables. ', 'SR': 'Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). To do this double click on the inner list\'s Data Item to edit its expression. Click on "Available Data Sets", choose data set "offices", then double click on column "COUNTRY". '}
