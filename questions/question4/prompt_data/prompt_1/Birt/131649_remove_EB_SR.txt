Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB(Observed Behavior), EB(Expected Behavior), and SR(Steps to Reproduce) sections.  In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.  Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '131649', 'title': 'Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table', 'description': 'Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table This design uses a 2level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this:row["FIRSTNAME"] + " " + row["LASTNAME"] + " / " + row["OFFICECODE"]However this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on "COUNTRY" is to insertrows[0]["COUNTRY"]into the expression.The first index (an integer) to the "rows" array is the 0based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table etc.). ', 'OB': 'It runs fine.Now imagine that the designer wants to append a country name suffix to each employee name (e.g., "Diane Merphy / USA"). An expression row["COUNTRY"] is added to the expression text. The problem is that row["OFFICECODE"] is not valid in the inner table. In order for the inner table to access the outer table\'s columns, the expression needs to use the "rows" object. ', 'EB': '', 'SR': ''}
