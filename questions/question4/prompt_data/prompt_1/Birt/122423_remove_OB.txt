Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB(Observed Behavior), EB(Expected Behavior), and SR(Steps to Reproduce) sections.  In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.  Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '122423', 'title': 'Bug 122423Support page range in RenderTask', 'description': 'Bug 122423Support page range in RenderTask If so, parse it and form a range and output them one after another, with a page splitter in between just like the runAndRenderTask. There can only be one page in case a page number is set. ', 'OB': '', 'EB': 'The code should check if there is range set. Invalid page number should be logged, and error message is returned. If neither is set, we default to all pages, instead of the current behavior of giving an error message. ', 'SR': 'Support page range in render task.For PDF format, simply log a message saying range is not supported if a range is specified, and still output whole report.For HTML format, support page range in the form of "1,2,510" + "All". If no range is set, check if page number is set. '}
