Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB(Observed Behavior), EB(Expected Behavior), and SR(Steps to Reproduce) sections.  In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.  Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '10654', 'title': 'Bug 10654Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path', 'description': 'Bug 10654Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path ', 'OB': 'When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have tospecify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the samedirectory. ', 'EB': 'It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point tothe whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to thebuild path.This would be analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher you can specify the system property java.ext.dirs to point to a list ofdirectories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath.This feature suggested itself to me after using a class contained in theWebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0).
