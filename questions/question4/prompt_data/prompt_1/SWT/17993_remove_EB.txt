Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB(Observed Behavior), EB(Expected Behavior), and SR(Steps to Reproduce) sections.  In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.  Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '17993', 'title': "Bug 17993Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", 'description': 'It wouldbe better if what I type isn\'t replaced with a value from the history.The current behaviour seems to be similar to "autocomplete" which isparticularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full "autocomplete"feature could be provided. ', 'OB': 'I\'m using the F1 build.The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through EditFind/Replace...) has a historyof recent searches. When you type in the "Find" or "Replace With" fields itsearches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces whatyou have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history iscase insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may bechanged to the case of the value in the history.In some scenarios this makes it impossible to perform find or replaceoperations. ', 'EB': '', 'SR': 'When you type in the "Find" or "Replace With" fields itsearches for entries from a previous search. For example, searching for "hello" and replacing it with "hi" thensearching for "Hello" and replacing it with "Hi" is not possible. Choose EditFind/Replace... Type "a" into the Find field. Click "Find". Try to type "A" into the Find field. '}
