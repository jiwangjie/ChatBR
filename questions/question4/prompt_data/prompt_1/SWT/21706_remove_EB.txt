Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB(Observed Behavior), EB(Expected Behavior), and SR(Steps to Reproduce) sections.  In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.  Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

{'id': '21706', 'title': 'Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage', 'description': 'Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage ', 'OB': 'Well, kind of.And so what if it does?OK, 2047 has a line in org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil of:static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, "windowProc", 4);The BidiUtil.class is syntactic sugar for Class.forName("org...BidiUtil").Theproblem with this is that method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is notdefined in the CLDC class libraries, which causes us a little problem in theCLDC version of SWT.You\'d only see this problem if you verified or usedjxeLink or something; the compiler gens the call itself, and just assumesNoClassDefFoundError is around, so you won\'t ever get a compiler error from theeclipse compiler (nor Sun\'s compiler).So, I\'d like this changed.Here\'s the simplest way to change to remove thereflection. ', 'EB': '', 'SR': 'change the line above to:static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), "windowProc", 4);I haven\'t tested it, but it should do exactly the same thing. '}
