{"id": "10654", "title": "Allow adding multiple jars from a folder to build path", "description": "Currently, when adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, each jar file must be specified separately, even if they are located in the same directory. This can be time-consuming and tedious, especially when there are multiple jar files in a single folder. It would be more convenient if there was an option to add all the jar files in a folder to the build path at once.", "OB": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory.", "EB": "", "SR": "Provide an option to add all jar files from a selected folder to the build path at once when using classpath variables."}
