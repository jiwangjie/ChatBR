{"id": "13269", "title": "Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "The operation order in the jarpackager is incorrect. This issue also applies to the '.jardesc' file. It would be better to have a warning in the wizard's header, accompanied by an icon, for the '.jardesc' file instead of a dialog box at the end. To achieve the desired behavior, the user can choose the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. Additionally, when the user chooses not to overwrite the manifest file, the message 'saving manifest file failed' is incorrect as it is not truly a failure.", "OB": "The jar file is created before the overwrite verifications occur.", "EB": "The operation order in the jarpackager should be corrected to ensure the overwrite verifications occur before the creation of the jar file. A warning should be displayed in the wizard's header, accompanied by an icon, for the '.jardesc' file instead of a dialog box at the end. The wording of the message 'saving manifest file failed' should also be revised to accurately reflect whether a failure occurred based on the user's choice to overwrite the manifest file or not.", "SR": "Ensure that the jarpackager performs the overwrite verifications before creating the jar file.
