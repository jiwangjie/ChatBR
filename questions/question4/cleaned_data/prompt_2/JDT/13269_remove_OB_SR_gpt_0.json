{"id": "13269", "title": "Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager, the operation order is incorrect. This issue also occurs with the '.jardesc' file. It would be better to display a warning in the wizard's header, along with the icon, instead of a dialog box at the end for the '.jardesc' file case. If the user wants to save the manifest in the workspace, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option.", "OB": "Currently, the operation order in jarpackager is incorrect.

Additionally, the 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not save a new manifest file.", "SR": "Fix the operation order in jarpackager to ensure it is correct.
