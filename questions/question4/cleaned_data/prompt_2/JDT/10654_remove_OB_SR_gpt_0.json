{"id": "10654", "title": "Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jars to the build path, it would be useful if a classpath variable could be used to point to the entire directory. This would allow all jar files in that directory to be automatically added to the build path. Currently, only individual jar files can be added. \nThis feature is similar to the installed extensions feature of the Java launcher, where the system property `java.ext.dirs` can be used to specify a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath.\nThe need for this feature arose when using a class contained in the WebSphere Test Environment plugin in WSAD4.0.", "OB": "", "EB": "Enable the ability to add all jar files in a specified directory to the build path by using a classpath variable. This would simplify the process of adding multiple jar files to the build path.", "SR": "1. Add a new option to the 'Add JARs' dialog to allow users to select a classpath variable that represents a directory containing multiple jar files.\n2. When the classpath variable is selected, automatically add all jar files in the corresponding directory to the build path.\n3. Update the documentation to explain how to use this new feature and the benefits it provides."}
