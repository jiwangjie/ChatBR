{"id": "14113", "title": "Should listen to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas", "description": "The current behavior is that when the attached source of a jar is changed, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired. This is incorrect as it should be firing a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta instead. Consequently, the UI reacts by closing the class file editors that are open on this jar, which is appropriate for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when I tried to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI did not react.", "OB": "Currently, when the attached source of a jar is changed, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta should be fired when the attached source of a jar is changed.", "SR": "Build 20020416"}
