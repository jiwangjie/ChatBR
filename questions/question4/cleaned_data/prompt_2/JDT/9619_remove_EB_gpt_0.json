{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member - Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9619: Move static member - Dialog details 20020212a. Mnemonics. No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName. The label could say 'Select destination type:'.", "OB": "Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes). Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "Browse offers me a type from a CU in a different project.", "SR": "The browse button should be resized to match the standard button sizes. The dialog title should not be used for displaying long text. When navigating to the next page, the error message should accurately state the reason (e.g., 'Selected type does not exist'). The dialog should only display types from the source folders of the current project. The refactoring process should not falsely warn about potential errors and should not make unnecessary changes in referencing classes. The browse functionality should only offer types from the same project."}
