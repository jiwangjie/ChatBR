If there is an open editor, all manipulations should just work on the working copy shown in the editor.", "SR": "From the user's perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference when manipulating the source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browser perspective. \n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Open Java Browsing Perspective\n2) Select a type\n3) Select a method in the method list view\n4) Delete the method from the context menu of the method list view\n   - Expected result: The editor becomes dirty\n5) Select another type\n6) Open type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view\n7) Select a method in the method list view\n8) Select the same method in the hierarchy view\n9) Delete the method from the context menu of the hierarchy view\n   - Expected result: The method should be deleted only on the file system, but the type list view, method list view, and editor should remain unaffected.\n\nNote: This is not the case when the editor is dirty."}
