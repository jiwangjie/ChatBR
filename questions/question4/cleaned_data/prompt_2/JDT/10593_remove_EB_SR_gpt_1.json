  "title": "Bug 10593: Jar export should add \".jar\" suffix if not specified",
  "description": "When exporting files using the Jar export feature in Build 20020228, if a user enters a custom name like \"test\" for the jar file, the exported jar file is created without the \".jar\" suffix. The expected behavior is that the suffix should be added automatically, resulting in a jar file named \"test.jar\".",
  "OB": "Upon selecting some files and exporting them using the jar export with the name \"test\", a jar file named \"test\" is created instead of \"test.jar\".",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the exported jar file should be named \"test.jar\" when the user enters \"test\" as the jar name during export.",
  "SR": "1. Open Build 20020228.\n2. Select some files.\n3. Choose the Jar export option.\n4. Enter \"test\" as the jar name.\n5. Observe that the created jar file is named \"test\" instead of \"test.jar\"."
