{"id": "10654", "title": "Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. In order to get my code to compile, I had to manually search through the jar files to find the missing classes, and add in the appropriate jars. It would be helpful if there was an option to add all jar files in a folder to the build path at once.", "OB": "There is currently no option to add all jar files in a folder to the build path at once. Users have to manually add each jar file individually, even if they are in the same directory.", "EB": "Add an option to add all jar files in a folder to the build path at once, eliminating the need to add each jar file individually.", "SR": "Introduce a feature that allows users to select a folder containing multiple jar files and add them to the build path with a single action."}
