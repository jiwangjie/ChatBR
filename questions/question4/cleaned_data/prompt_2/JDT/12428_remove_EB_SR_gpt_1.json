  "description": "Bug 12428 Pull Up: Confusing message. Shouldn't it be 'Copy method 'void setUp()' FROM type 'TestCase'\" (also with uppercase C in Copy). Another thing: if I select to delete setUp from TestCase, I get under TestCase the message \"Delete method 'void setUp()' declared in type 'junit.framework.TestCase'. (Markus)",
  "OB": "In the tree of changes, under Assert, we get the message 'copy method 'void setUp()' to type 'TestCase'. Here, TestCase is shown with the fully qualified name.",
  "EB": "The message should be corrected to 'Copy method 'void setUp()' FROM type 'TestCase'\" with the correct capitalization in 'Copy'. Additionally, the deletion message under TestCase should be revised to accurately reflect the operation.",
  "SR": "1. Open the tree of changes.\n2. Navigate to Assert.\n3. Observe the message 'copy method 'void setUp()' to type 'TestCase'.\n4. Verify that 'TestCase' is displayed with the fully qualified name.\n\nTo Reproduce Delete Setup Method:\n1. Select to delete setUp from TestCase.\n2. Check the message under TestCase for accuracy, ensuring it reflects the deletion operation correctly."
