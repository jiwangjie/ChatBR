{"id": "13269", "title": "Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using jarpackager, the operation order is incorrect. The same issue occurs for '.jardesc' files. It would be better to display a warning in the wizard's header, accompanied by an icon, for the case of the '.jardesc' file instead of a dialog box at the end. Users who wish to overwrite the manifest file should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. The current behavior is due to the jar file being created before the overwrite verifications take place. It is worth noting that the message 'saving manifest file failed' is incorrect in this case since the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file, so it is not a failure.", "OB": "The jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1) Select some packages and export them as a jar file.\n2) Choose 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3) Click 'Next'.\n4) In 'Save description of this JAR in workspace', select an existing .jardesc file.\n5) Click 'Next'.\n6) Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest file that already exists (easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n7) Click 'Finish'.\n8) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n9) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\nNote that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed, because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. If you click 'OK', you will return to the wizard.\n10) Choose 'Cancel'.\nCheck the location where your .jar file was supposed to be generated and note that it was indeed created."}
