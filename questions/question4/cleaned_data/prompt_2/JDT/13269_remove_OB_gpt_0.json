{"id": "13269", "title": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager, the operation order is incorrect. This also applies to the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps it would be better to display a warning in the wizard's header, along with the icon, for the '.jardesc' file instead of a dialog box at the end. If the user wants to use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option, they can choose that. However, not overwriting the file should not cause the wizard to fail to complete its operation. Additionally, the 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not save a new manifest file.", "OB": "The operation order in the jarpackager is incorrect. The '.jardesc' file displays a dialog box at the end instead of a warning in the wizard's header.

Ensure that the 'use existing manifest from workspace' option does not save a new manifest file.", "SR": "Steps:\n1) Select the packages to export as a JAR.\n2) Choose 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3) Click 'Next'.\n4) Select a '.jardesc' file that already exists in the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' option.\n5) Click 'Next'.\n6) Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose an existing manifest file (you can run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings for this).\n7) Click 'Finish'.\n8) A dialog will appear asking if you want to overwrite the '.jardesc' file. Choose 'NO'.\n9) Another dialog will appear asking if you want to overwrite the manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\nNote the error dialog stating that JAR creation failed, because saving the manifest to the workspace and saving the description to the workspace failed. Click 'OK' to return to the wizard.\n10) Choose 'Cancel'.\nCheck the location where the .jar file was supposed to be generated and confirm that it was indeed created."}
