{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "When debugging a Java file, if a Class File Editor is opened (specifically, if the user clicks on the scrollbar's down arrow), scrolling through the editor does not behave as expected. Currently, when clicking on the scrollbar's background, the editor only scrolls about a line at a time, instead of scrolling a page at a time as it should. Additionally, when using the scrollbar's down arrow, the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. However, grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.", "OB": "1. Put a breakpoint in a Java file, right before a System.out.println statement.\n2. Debug to the breakpoint and step into the println call (you may end up in StringBuffer first, but that doesn't matter as long as you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into).\n3. A Class File Editor will open.\n4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe editor should scroll a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background or using the scrollbar's down arrow.", "EB": "", "SR": "1.
