{"id": "18028", "title": "Bug 18028: Rename package doesn't check if all resources are writeable", "description": "When trying to rename a package, the current implementation does not check if all resources within the package are writeable. This can lead to unexpected exceptions during the process. ", "OB": "F1+ create a package with a class unit (CU) inside it. Make the CU read-only. Then, try to rename the package.", "EB": "After attempting to rename the package, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "SR": "The system should properly check whether all resources in a package are writeable before allowing the package to be renamed. If any resource is read-only, the renaming process should be blocked and an appropriate error message should be displayed to the user."}
