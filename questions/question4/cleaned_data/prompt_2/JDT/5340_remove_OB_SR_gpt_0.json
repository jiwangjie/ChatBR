{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately and eventually the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. This behavior should be changed to either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter.", "OB": "The progress dialog does not honor the cancellation request when adding an exception breakpoint.", "EB": "The progress dialog should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button when adding an exception breakpoint.", "SR": "Update the code in ProgressMonitorDialog.run to pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter when adding an exception breakpoint."}
