As a result, the UI reacts by closing the class file editors opened on this jar, which is intended behavior for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH Java delta. However, when I tried to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI did not respond.", "OB": "Build 20020416", "EB": "", "SR": "When changing the attached source of a jar, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH Java delta is incorrectly fired.
