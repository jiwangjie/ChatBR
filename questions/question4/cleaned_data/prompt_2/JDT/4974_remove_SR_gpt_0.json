{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the user presses 'Ok' after setting the output location, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. Setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "To address this issue, the setting of classpath and output location should be combined into one operation, similar to the validation process that checks both classpath and output location simultaneously. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
