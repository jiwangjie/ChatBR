This behavior is inconsistent with user expectations.", "OB": "Build 20020228, select some files, export them using the jar export feature, enter \"test\" as the jar name, and it creates a jar file called \"test\" instead of \"test.jar\".", "EB": "", "SR": "When exporting files as a jar, if the user enters a name without the \".jar\" suffix, the application should automatically add the suffix. This ensures consistency and meets user expectations. \n- Modify the jar export feature to append \".jar\" to the name if it does not already include the suffix.\n- Update any relevant documentation or user guides to reflect this change."}
