Currently, the actions are distributed in a way that is not clear to users. Some actions are in the context menu and some are not, which forces users to switch views to access certain actions. This should be changed to make all actions reachable from the editor.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "Ensure that the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is included in the context menu options for text selection."}
