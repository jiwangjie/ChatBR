The issue can be reproduced as follows:\n\n1) Open Java Browsing Perspective\n2) Select a type\n3) Select a method in the method list view\n4) Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view\n5) The editor becomes dirty\n6) Select another type\n7) Open type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view\n8) Select a method in the method list view\n9) Select the same method in the hierarchy view\n10) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view\n11) The method is deleted on the file system and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared.\n\nNote: This issue does not occur when the editor is dirty.", "OB": "The editor becomes dirty when a method is deleted from the method list view using the context menu.", "EB": "After deleting a method from the hierarchy view, the method is deleted from the file system and all related views and editor are cleared.", "SR": "The expected behavior is that deleting a method from the hierarchy view should only delete the method from the hierarchy view and leave the file system and other views/editor unaffected."}
