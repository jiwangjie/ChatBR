  "description": "Bug 14113 Should listen to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas",
  "OB": "Build 20020416: Currently, when changing the attached source of a JAR, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired, which is incorrect. As a result, the UI closes the class file editors opened on this JAR, which is appropriate for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when attempting to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not react as expected.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the UI should properly react to (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) deltas when changing the attached source of a JAR. Class file editors should remain open without unnecessary closure.",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a JAR in the IDE.\n2. Change the attached source of the JAR.\n3. Observe the firing of the java delta (FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH).\n4. Attempt to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta.\n5. Observe the lack of expected UI reaction."
