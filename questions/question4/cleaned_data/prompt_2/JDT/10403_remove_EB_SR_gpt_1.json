  "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed",
  "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory, which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "OB": "Upon project creation, there is no confirmation or check to ensure that the bin directory, specified as the output folder, can be deleted and rebuilt.",
  "EB": "After creating a project, there should be a confirmation or check to ensure that the specified bin directory (output folder) can be successfully deleted and then rebuilt.",
  "SR": "1. Open the application and navigate to the project creation wizard.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure for the new project.\n3. Specify the bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Complete the project creation process.\n5. Verify that there is a confirmation or check to ensure that the specified bin directory can be deleted and successfully rebuilt."
