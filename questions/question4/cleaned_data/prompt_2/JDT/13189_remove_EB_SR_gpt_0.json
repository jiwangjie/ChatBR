{"id": "13189", "title": "Bug 13189: Refactoring - Deleting fields context menu is overridden by message dialog", "description": "When attempting to delete fields using the context menu, the expected behavior is that a context menu is shown. However, on Linux Motif and Windows 2000, a message dialog is displayed instead. This dialog asks if the user wants to delete the getter/setter as well. This behavior prevents the user from deleting fields directly using the context menu.", "OB": "No context menu is shown. Instead, a message dialog prompts the user to confirm deletion of getter/setter methods.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the context menu to be displayed, allowing the user to delete fields directly without the need to confirm deletion of getter/setter methods.", "SR": "Ensure that the context menu for deleting fields is displayed correctly, without the interference of a message dialog asking to delete getter/setter methods."}
