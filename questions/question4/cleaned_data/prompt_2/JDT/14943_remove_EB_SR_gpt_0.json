{"id": "14943", "title": "Bug 14943: Code Assist does not respect platform line ends", "description": "When using code assist to create a for loop with a temporary variable on a Windows machine, the resulting code has LF (linefeed) as line separators instead of the expected CRLF (carriage return + linefeed). This behavior violates the standards of Windows platform line ends.", "OB": "Create a for loop with a temporary variable using code assist on a Windows machine.", "EB": "The resulting code should have CRLF as line separators on a Windows machine.", "SR": "Fix the code assist feature to respect platform line ends and produce code with CRLF as line separators on a Windows machine."}
