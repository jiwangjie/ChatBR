{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message (1GD0L9O)", "description": "When using the New Package Wizard, a confusing message appears at the top of the wizard before any text is entered in the package name field. The message states: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message is unclear and it is unclear if it is an error. It should be displayed in red with the error icon to indicate an error if it is indeed an error. There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Additionally, there should be a way to create a default package as it is currently not possible for the user to create a default package.",
