{"id": "14113", "title": "Bug 14113 - Should listen to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas", "description": "When changing the attached source of a jar, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is being fired, which is incorrect. As a result, the UI closes the class file editors that are open on this jar, which is the expected behavior for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when trying to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not react.", "OB": "The bug causes a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta to be fired instead of a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta when changing the attached source of a jar. This leads to the UI incorrectly closing the class file editors opened on the affected jar.", "EB": "The bug should be fixed so that changing the attached source of a jar triggers a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta instead of a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH delta. The UI should react accordingly by not closing the class file editors opened on the jar.", "SR": "The code should be modified to correctly fire a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta when changing the attached source of a jar in order to ensure the UI behaves as expected."}
