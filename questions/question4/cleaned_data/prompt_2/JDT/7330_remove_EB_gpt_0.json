"description": "I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions available in the context menu seem to be distributed based on personal taste. This should be changed as it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views in order to access certain actions. The action should be included in the context menu, and if not, it should be accessible via the Edit menu.",
"OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu and it is not clear to users why some actions are included there and some are not.",
"EB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be added to the context menu to ensure it is easily accessible to users.",
"SR": "Include the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" in the context menu, or make it accessible via the Edit menu."}
