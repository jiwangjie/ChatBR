{"id": "13269", "title": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager, the operation order is incorrect. The same issue occurs with the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning should be displayed in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) instead of a dialog box at the end, specifically for the '.jardesc' file. If the user wants to proceed, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. This bug was reported on 20020409 by JRT.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1) Select some packages and export them as a JAR\n2) In the export wizard, select the option 'Export java source files and resources'\n3) Click 'Next'\n4) In the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' section, choose a .jardesc file that already exists\n5) Click 'Next'\n6) Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest that already exists (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings)\n7) Click 'Finish'\n8) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'\n9) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'\n(Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed, because saving the manifest to workspace failed and saving the description to workspace failed. If you click 'OK' you will return to the wizard.)\n10) Choose 'Cancel'\n\nExpected Results:\n- The JAR creation should not fail\n- No error dialog should be displayed\n\nActual Results:\n- JAR creation fails\n- An error dialog is displayed\n\nNote: After reproducing the bug, go to the location where the .jar file was supposed to be generated and note that it was indeed created."}
