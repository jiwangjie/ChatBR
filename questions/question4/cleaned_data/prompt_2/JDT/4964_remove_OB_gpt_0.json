{"id": "4964", "title": "Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I typed `button.dispose`. However, the code assist list was displayed without my realization. The automatic code assist selected `DISPOSED` as the suggested completion, resulting in the incorrect code `button.DISPOSED`. I had to delete it and start again, paying more attention this time. The code assist should be smarter and notice that I have typed a `(` after `dispose`, making the suggestion `dispose()` a better match than `DISPOSED`. Additionally, the code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "Build 204"}
