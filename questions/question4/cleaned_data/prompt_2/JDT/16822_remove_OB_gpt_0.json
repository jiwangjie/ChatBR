{"id": "16822", "title": "Bug 16822 - Search results not being removed when cu is moved", "description": "Build 200205211.", "OB": "When a Java compilation unit (cu) is moved from one source folder to another in project P, the search results in the search view are not being removed.", "EB": "When a cu is moved from one source folder to another in project P, the search results in the search view are not being automatically removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a project P with 2 source folders 'src1' and 'src2'.\n2. Create a compilation unit X.java under 'P/src1':\n   public class X {}\n3. Search for the declaration of X.\n4. Move X.java to 'P/src2'.\n\nExpected behavior: The search result should be removed from the search view when the cu is moved.\n\nActual behavior: The search result is still displayed in the search view. Attempting to double-click on the search result opens a 'Search Error' dialog saying:\n\nAn error occurred while creating a Java element.\nReason: X.java does not exist."}
