  "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor scrolling issue",
  "description": "Observed behavior on 20020521 (F1) (This may not be a debug PRI; wasn't sure). So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.",
  "OB": "When putting a breakpoint in a Java file right before a System.out.println statement and debugging to the breakpoint, stepping into the println call (I happened to go into StringBuffer first; all that matters is that you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into), a Class File Editor opens. Clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow exhibits the issue: the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. Clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time also shows the problem: the editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time. Grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.",
  "EB": "The Class File Editor scrollbar should exhibit natural scrolling behavior when navigating through breakpoints and stepping into code. Clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow or background should result in smooth and expected scrolling, reflecting the appropriate distance per action. The thumb should facilitate convenient and effective scrolling as observed when using it.",
  "SR": "1. Put a breakpoint in a Java file right before a System.out.println statement. 2. Debug to the breakpoint, stepping into the println call (It doesn't matter which method you step into; the key is not having the source for the class you just stepped into). 3. A Class File Editor opens. 4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow. Observed behavior: The editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. 5. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time. Observed behavior: The editor only scrolls about a line at a time instead of scrolling a page at a time. 6. Alternatively, grab the thumb and scroll. Observed behavior: Smooth and expected scrolling, demonstrating the correct behavior."
