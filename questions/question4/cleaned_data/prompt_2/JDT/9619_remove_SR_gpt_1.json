Currently, the existence of a type is not too costly (handled in the type wizard for superclass), so it could be implemented. At the very least, it should check for isValidTypeName.\nc. The browse button appears too small; consider using SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\nd. The title is utilized for lengthy text. When transitioning to the next page, it displays 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be visible in the dialog.\ne. The destination type can be the same as the source type: during refactoring, a warning erroneously suggests errors will occur (which is untrue) and generates pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.\nf. The label should state 'Select destination type:'.",
