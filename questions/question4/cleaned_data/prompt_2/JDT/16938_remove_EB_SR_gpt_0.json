{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "When using the Class File Editor and trying to scroll through the editor, the scrolling is not smooth. Currently, scrolling using the scrollbar's down arrow only scrolls one pixel at a time, and scrolling using the scrollbar's background only scrolls about a line at a time instead of a page at a time. The workaround is to use the thumb of the scrollbar to scroll. Please fix the scrolling behavior in the Class File Editor to make it more natural and consistent.", "OB": "1. Put a breakpoint in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement.\n2. Debug to the breakpoint and step into the println call. (Note: It doesn't matter if you go into StringBuffer first, as long as you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into.)\n3. A Class File Editor opens.\n4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow.\n\nProblem: The editor only scrolls one pixel at a time.\n\n5. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time.\n\nProblem: The editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
