{"id": "10654", "title": "Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. This process is time-consuming and error-prone. It would be useful to have a feature that allows you to use a classpath variable to specify a whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are automatically added to the build path. This feature is analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher, where you can specify the system property 'java.ext.dirs' to add a list of directories containing jar files to the classpath. This feature would simplify the process of adding multiple jar files to the build path and reduce the risk of missing required classes.", "OB": "Currently, when adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory.", "EB": "It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point to the whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are automatically added to the build path.", "SR": "Provide a feature that allows users to add all jar files in a specified directory to the build path by using a classpath variable.
