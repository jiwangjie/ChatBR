  "description": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager. The same issue occurs for the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file, then a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. 20020409. JRT.",
  "OB": "The jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen. Other notes: The message 'saving manifest file failed' is perhaps incorrect in this case as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file (thus it is not really a failure).",
  "EB": "The jar packaging process should handle the overwrite verifications correctly, and the error message 'saving manifest file failed' should accurately reflect the failure to save due to the user choosing not to overwrite the manifest file.",
  "SR": "Steps:\n1) Select some packages and export jar\n2) Select 'Export java source files and resources'\n3) Next\n4) Select in 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' a .jardesc that already exists.\n5) Next\n6) Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest that already exists (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n7) Finish\n8) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose NO.\n9) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose NO. Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed because saving manifest to workspace failed and saving description to workspace failed. If you click okay, you will return to the wizard.\n10) Choose Cancel. Go to where your .jar file was to have been generated and note that it was indeed created."
