  "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller",
  "description": "When using the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), replacing 'com.ibm.foobar' with 'co~.ib~.foobar' occurs. I believe that package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. Thus, 'com.' should not be replaced in this example, since 'co~.' is the same length and contains less information.",
  "OB": "When attempting to replace package name fragments, the current behavior results in replacing 'com.ibm.foobar' with 'co~.ib~.foobar', even when the compressed name is not smaller.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is smaller, preserving 'com.' in this example.",
  "SR": "1. Open the preferences menu.\n2. Navigate to the 'Java Work in Progress' section.\n3. Locate the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field.\n4. Enter 'com.ibm.foobar' as the package name.\n5. Observe that the replacement occurs incorrectly with 'co~.ib~.foobar'."
