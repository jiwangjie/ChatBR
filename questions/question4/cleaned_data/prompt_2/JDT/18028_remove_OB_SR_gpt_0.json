{"id": "18028", "title": "Bug 18028: Rename package doesn't check if all resources are writeable", "description": "When trying to rename a package, the current implementation does not verify whether all the resources inside the package are writable. This can result in a failure to rename the package and potential data loss. The code should be updated to include a precondition check for read-only files within the package before proceeding with the rename operation.", "OB": "The current implementation does not check if all resources within the package are writable before attempting to rename it.", "EB": "The code should include a precondition check to ensure that there are no read-only files within the package before attempting to rename it.", "SR": "Update the code to include a precondition check for read-only files inside the package before proceeding with the rename operation."}
