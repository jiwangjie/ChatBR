{"id": "11314", "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller", "description": "When using the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), if the package name 'com.ibm.foobar' is replaced with 'co~.ib~.foobar', I believe the package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. In this example, 'com.' should not be replaced since 'co~.' is the same length and contains less information.", "OB": "When using the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), if the package name 'com.ibm.foobar' is replaced with 'co~.ib~.foobar', 'com.' should not be replaced since 'co~.' is the same length and contains less information.", "EB": "", "SR": "In Build 20020214, when entering '2~.'"}
