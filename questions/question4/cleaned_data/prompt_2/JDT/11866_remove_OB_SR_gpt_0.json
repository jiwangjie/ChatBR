{"id": "11866", "title": "Wrong labels in Update Test Suite dialog", "description": "When updating the test suite, there are several issues with the labels in the dialog. The label 'Test Classes to be included' is written as 'TestClasses' without a space. The status line refers to methods being selected instead of types. Additionally, the action name is written as 'TestSuite' instead of 'Test Suite'. These issues should be fixed to ensure clear and accurate labeling in the dialog.", "OB": "The label 'TestClasses' is missing a space and should be corrected to 'Test Classes'. The status line should be updated to mention types instead of methods. The action name should be written as 'Test Suite' instead of 'TestSuite'.", "EB": "The label 'Test Classes to be included' is written with TestClasses (missing space). The status line talks about methods being selected instead of types. The action name is written together (TestSuite) instead of Test Suite.", "SR": "Ensure that the label 'Test Classes to be included' is written as 'Test Classes', correct the status line to refer to types instead of methods, and write the action name as 'Test Suite' instead of 'TestSuite'."}
