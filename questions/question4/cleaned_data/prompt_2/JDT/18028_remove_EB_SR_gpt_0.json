{"id": "18028", "title": "Bug 18028: Rename package doesn't check if all resources are writeable", "description": "When attempting to rename a package in the software, the system does not verify if all the resources within the package are writeable. As a result, unexpected exception dialogs appear after the renaming process is completed.", "OB": "To reproduce this bug:\n1. Create a package with a source code file in it.\n2. Make the source code file read-only.\n3. Try to rename the package.\n\nObserve: After the renaming process finishes, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "EB": "The system should perform a check to ensure that all resources within a package are writeable before allowing the package to be renamed. If any resource is read-only, the rename operation should be blocked and appropriate error messages should be displayed to the user.", "SR": "1. Implement a verification process before allowing package renaming, checking if all resources in the package are writeable.\n2. If any resource is found to be read-only, block the rename operation.\n3. Display appropriate error messages to inform the user of the failed rename operation and the reason (readonly resource)."}
