  "description": "When attempting to add Javadoc to a field in TH (presumably referring to a specific context or tool), selecting 'Add Javadoc' from the context menu doesn't trigger any action or change.",
  "OB": "Selecting 'Add Javadoc' from the context menu for a field in TH results in no action or change.",
  "EB": "When 'Add Javadoc' is chosen from the context menu for a field in TH, it should either trigger the addition of Javadoc to the selected field or remove this option from the menu if it's not functional.",
  "SR": "1. Open TH.\n2. Navigate to a field for which you want to add Javadoc.\n3. Right-click on the field to access the context menu.\n4. Choose 'Add Javadoc'.\n5. Observe if any action occurs or if the Javadoc gets added to the field."
