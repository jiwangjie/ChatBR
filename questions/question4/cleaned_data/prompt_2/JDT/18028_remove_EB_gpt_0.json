This can lead to unexpected exceptions.", "OB": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a package with a compilation unit (CU) in it. \n2. Make the CU readonly. \n3. Try to rename the package. \n\nObservers: After the rename operation completes, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "EB": "", "SR": "To fix this issue, the system should check the writeability of all resources within a package before allowing the rename operation to proceed. If any resource is readonly, the system should prevent the rename operation and display an appropriate error message."}
