{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "When using the Class File editor (version 20020521), scrolling through the editor is not working as expected. The current workaround is to always use the thumb to scroll.", "OB": "Scrolling in the Class File Editor is not smooth and only moves one pixel at a time.", "EB": "Scrolling in the Class File Editor should scroll a full page at a time instead of just one pixel.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Put a breakpoint in a Java file, right before a System.out.println statement.  \n2. Debug to the breakpoint and step into the println call (Note: I happened to go into StringBuffer first, but all that matters is that you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into).  \n3. A Class File Editor will open.  \n4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow.  \nResult: The editor only scrolls one pixel at a time.  \n5. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time.  \nResult: The editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time.  \nExpected result: Scrolling in the Class File Editor should be smooth and scroll a full page at a time."}
