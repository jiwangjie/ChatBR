The buttons are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog is opened, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing the name of a parameter to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\nd. The dialog comes up larger than expected for methods with many parameters.\n\nTo improve the user experience and ensure consistency, the following changes are suggested:\n\ni. Perform duplicated name validation on the first page of the dialog.\n\nj. Merge the first and second columns in the dialog.", "OB": "a. The buttons are too small.\nb.
