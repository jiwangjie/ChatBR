{"id": "13189", "title": "Bug 13189: Refactoring - deleting fields context menu is overridden by message dialog", "description": "I encountered a bug while trying to delete fields in the code. When I right-click on a field in the outliner and click on the context menu option to delete the field, instead of showing the context menu, a message dialog pops up asking if I want to delete the getter/setter as well. This behavior is different from what is expected.", "OB": "After enabling the option 'Code Generator - Remove prefix from field names', I open the TestCase.java file. In the outliner, I right-click on the 'fName' field.", "EB": "I expect to see a context menu with options related to deleting the field, such as 'Delete' or 'Remove'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Preferences menu and navigate to 'Code Generator' section\n2. Enable the option 'Code Generator - Remove prefix from field names'\n3. Open the TestCase.java file\n4. In the outliner, right-click on the 'fName' field"}
