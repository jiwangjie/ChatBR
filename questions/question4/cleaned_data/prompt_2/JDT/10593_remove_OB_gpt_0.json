Instead, it retains the name as entered by the user. This is incorrect behavior.", "OB": "Exporting files using the jar export feature with no specified file extension", "EB": "The exported jar file does not have the \".jar\" suffix, it retains the name as entered by the user.", "SR": "The correct behavior should be that when exporting files using the jar export feature without specifying the file extension, the exported jar file should automatically be named with the \".jar\" suffix appended to the user-entered name. For example, if the user enters \"test\" as the jar name, the exported jar file should be named \"test.jar\"."}
