{"id": "12428", "title": "Bug 12428: Confusing message in Pull Up wizard",
  "description": "When performing the Pull Up refactoring on TestCase.setUp method, the message displayed is confusing. It currently says 'Copymethod 'void setUp()' FROM type 'TestCase'. The word 'Copy' should have an uppercase 'C' and it should use the fully qualified name. Additionally, when selecting to delete setUp from TestCase, the message on TestCasethe should be consistent and also use the fully qualified name. (Markus)", "OB": "", "EB": "The 'copy method' text should be consistent and also use the fully qualified name. ",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Run the Pull Up refactoring on TestCase.setUp method, which copies the method to Assert.\n2. Navigate to the second page of the wizard."}
