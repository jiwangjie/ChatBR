{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to prioritize matching method over variable name", "description": "When using the automatic code assist feature, I encountered an issue. Specifically, when I typed 'button.DISPOSED', the code assist feature selected 'DISPOSED' instead of the method 'dispose()'. This resulted in unwanted code being inserted ('button.DISPOSED') and I had to manually delete it. To prevent this, the code assist feature should prioritize matching method names over variable names.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest making the code assist feature case-sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "OB": "", "EB": "The automatic code assist feature should prioritize matching method names over variable names and should be made case-sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "SR": ""}
