{"id": "13189", "title": "Bug 13189: Refactoring - Deleting fields context menu is overridden by message dialog", "description": "When performing refactoring in Eclipse, the context menu for deleting fields is overridden by a message dialog instead. This issue has been observed on LinuxMotif and w2k platforms. \nTo reproduce:\n1. Setup JUnit.\n2. Enable the option 'Code GeneratorRemove prefix from field names'.\n3. Open TestCase.java.\n4. In the outliner, right-click on 'fName'.\n5. Instead of a context menu, a message dialog prompt appears immediately asking if the getter/setter should also be deleted.", "OB": "The context menu for deleting fields is not shown when performing the refactoring operation. Instead, a message dialog prompt appears immediately asking if the getter/setter should also be deleted.", "EB": "", "SR": "To resolve this issue, enable the option 'Code GeneratorRemove prefix from field names' and then reproduce the issue by opening TestCase.java and right-clicking on 'fName' in the outliner. The context menu for deleting fields should be displayed as expected, without being overridden by the message dialog prompt."}
