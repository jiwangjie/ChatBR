Renaming the action and the dialog to 'Recreate Test Suite' would resolve this issue.", "SR": "The 'Update' action in the Test Suite should actually recreate the test suite based on the selection in the dialog. Currently, when I perform an update on a test suite that contains X, it does not function as expected."}
