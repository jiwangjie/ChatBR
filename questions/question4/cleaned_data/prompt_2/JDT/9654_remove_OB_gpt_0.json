{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters: Dialog details", "description": "When modifying parameters in the dialog, the following issues were identified: \n\n- The name validation is duplicated on the first page. \n- The first and second columns should be merged. \n\nThe bug report is missing an observation (OB) statement, please provide a clear and complete observation statement.", "OB": "", "EB": "The spacing between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog. \n\nThe table should have a label to support the use of a mnemonic. \n\nMultiple selection should be allowed, as the 'move up' and 'move down' actions can be applied to more than one item. \n\nThe signature preview must be a label that wraps the text. Additionally, it would be beneficial if the signature preview had the background color set to the same color as the hover effect. \n\nWhen modifying a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.", "SR": "Please ensure that the preview properly displays the full parameter name even when it is very long."}
