{"id": "10654", "title": "Bug 10654: Allow all JARs in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding JAR files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each JAR file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. This is causing inconvenience and manual effort for users. It would be more efficient if users could add all JAR files in a folder to the build path at once.", "OB": "When adding JAR files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each JAR file separately, even if there are several in the same directory.", "EB": "I had to manually search and add in several JAR files from the WTE plugin directory to get my code to compile. This involved searching through the JAR files to find the missing classes and adding the appropriate JARs.", "SR": "Provide a feature that allows users to add all JAR files in a folder to the build path at once, when using classpath variables. This will save time and effort by eliminating the need to specify each JAR file separately."}
