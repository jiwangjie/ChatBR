Consider the enclosed class.\n\nAs a programmer, I must add a parameter to the 'baz' call in 'bar' to make the program correct.\n\nSteps:\n1. UI can decide whether it wants to use the code assist end position (until the end of the current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, in order to control the amount of source to replace.\n\nThe code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}\n\nKUM (5/21/01 9:02:11 AM)\nThe text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure.\n\nMoved to ITPJCORE.\n\nPM (9/4/2001 2:58:56 PM)\nOption was added.\n\nPM (9/25/2001 2:20:50 PM)\nRemoving option.\n\nThe choice amongst one or the other should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).\n\nMoving to ITPJUI.", "OB": "The code in the 'baz' call in 'bar' is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())", "EB": "The code in the 'baz' call in 'bar' is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\nThe choice amongst one or the other should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).\n\nMoving to ITPJUI.", "SR": "The code assist feature should allow for the choice between replacing until the end of the current identifier or until the cursor location.
