However, changing the output folder back to the project folder does not remove the class files. Additionally, when opening the 'project/bin' folder, all resources are still present. It should be noted that when opening the properties dialog for these resources, they are tagged as 'Derived'.", "OB": "1. Create a project with autobuild enabled.\n2.
