Renaming the action and dialog to 'Recreate Test Suite' would solve this problem.", "OB": "The 'Update' action for Test Suites does not allow any modifications and only displays the current content.", "EB": "The action and dialog for modifying Test Suites should be renamed to 'Recreate Test Suite' to accurately represent its functionality.", "SR": "Modify the Test Suite action and dialog to allow for modifications and rename them to 'Recreate Test Suite' for clarity."}
