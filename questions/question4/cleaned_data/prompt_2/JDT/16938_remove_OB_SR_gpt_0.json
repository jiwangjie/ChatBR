So the workaround, ifthe user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use thethumb. ", "OB": "The Class File Editor does not scroll as expected. Scrolling using the arrows only moves the editor about a line at a time, but it should scroll one line at a time. Additionally, clicking on the scrollbar's background does not scroll the editor a page at a time.", "EB": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally. The expected behavior is for the Class File Editor to scroll one line at a time when clicking on the arrows and to scroll a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background. Currently, the editor only scrolls about a line at a time. The thumb can be used to scroll effectively.", "SR": "Ensure that the Class File Editor scrolls one line at a time when clicking on the arrows and scrolls a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background. The current behavior is inconsistent and does not match user expectations. The scrolling with the thumb should also be maintained."}
