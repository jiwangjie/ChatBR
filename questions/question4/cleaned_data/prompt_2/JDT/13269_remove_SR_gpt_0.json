{"id": "13269", "title": "Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager, the operation order is incorrect. This issue also applies to the '.jardesc' file. It would be better to have a warning in the wizard's header, along with the icon, instead of a dialog box at the end for the '.jardesc' file. To resolve this, the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option should be combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. Moreover, when the user chooses not to overwrite the manifest file, the message 'saving manifest file failed' should not be displayed as it is not a failure in this case. The wizard should not fail to complete its operation when not overwriting this file. Additionally, the 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not save a new manifest file.", "OB": "The jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen.", "EB": "Ensure that not overwriting the file does not prevent the wizard from completing its operation. Implement changes so that the 'use existing manifest from workspace' option does not save a new manifest file.", "SR": "Modify the operation order in the jarpackager to address the issue with the '.jardesc' file.
