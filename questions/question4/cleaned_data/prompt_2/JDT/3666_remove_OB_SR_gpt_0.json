{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Eats Too Much Code", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the IDE consumes more code than necessary. This issue occurs when adding a parameter to the 'baz' method call in the 'bar' method. Here are the steps to reproduce:\n\n1. Open the enclosed class.\n2. Invoke code assist at the location where the parameter needs to be added.\n3. Notice that code assist replaces more code than required.\n\nThe expected behavior should be that code assist only replaces the necessary code to add the parameter to the 'baz' method call.", "OB": "Code assist replaces the code until the end of the current identifier, which leads to incorrect code and requires manual correction.", "EB": "The code should only be replaced until the cursor location where code assist was invoked, not until the end of the current identifier. This way, only the necessary code is replaced.", "SR": "Modify the code assist feature to replace the code until the cursor location where code assist was invoked, rather than until the end of the current identifier. This change should be triggered by a keystroke, such as 'Enter' for replacing until the end and 'Insert' for replacing until the cursor location."}
