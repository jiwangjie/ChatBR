{"id": "17618", "title": "Changing output location does not delete derived resources", "description": "When creating a project with autobuild enabled and importing Java sources and resources, changing the output folder to project/bin results in all class files being removed. Changing the output folder back to project also removes all class files. However, when opening the project/bin folder, all resources are still present. This behavior is inconsistent with the fact that class files are deleted when changing the output location. Additionally, when opening the properties dialog on such a resource, it is tagged as 'Derived'.", "OB": "1) Create a project with autobuild enabled. 2) Import Java sources and resources. 3) Change the output folder to project/bin. 4) Verify that all class files are removed from the project. 5) Change the output folder back to project and verify that all class files are removed again. 6) Open the project/bin folder and observe that all resources are still present.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
