{"id": "17618", "title": "Changing output location should delete all derived resources", "description": "When creating a project with autobuild enabled, importing Java sources and resources, and changing the output folder to project/bin, all class files are correctly removed. However, when changing the output folder back to the project, all class files are removed but the resources are still present in the project/bin folder. These resources are tagged as 'Derived' when opening the properties dialog on them.", "OB": "1. Create a project with autobuild enabled.\n2. Import Java sources and resources.\n3. Change the output folder to project/bin.\n4. Verify that all class files are removed (expected behavior).\n5. Change the output folder back to the project.\n6. Verify that all class files are removed (expected behavior).\n7. Open project/bin and confirm that the resources are still present.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that changing the output location should delete all derived resources. This should apply to any derived resources created by the Java builder.", "SR": ""}
