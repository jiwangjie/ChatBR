{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "Add a validation step during project creation to check if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. Prompt the user with a confirmation message to ensure that the output folder is not pointing to a bin directory that contains other files besides .class files that can be regenerated from .java files."}
