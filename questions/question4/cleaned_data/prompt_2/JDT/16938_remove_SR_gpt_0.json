So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.", "OB": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Put a breakpoint in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement, and debug to the breakpoint.\n2. Step into the println call (I happened to go into StringBuffer first, all that matters is that you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into).\n3. A Class File Editor opens.\n4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow.\n\nProblem:\nThe editor only scrolls one pixel at a time.\n\n5. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time.\n\nProblem:\nThe editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time.\n\nNote:\nGrabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.", "EB": "Summary:\nBug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n1.
