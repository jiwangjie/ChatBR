{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor scrolling issue", "description": "When scrolling through the Class File editor, the editor only scrolls about a line at a time instead of scrolling one line at a time when clicking on the arrows or scrolling a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background. The workaround is to use the thumb for scrolling. This issue occurs in version 20020521 (F1).", "OB": "The Class File Editor does not scroll naturally.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll one line at a time when clicking on the arrows and scroll a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Put a breakpoint in a Java file, right before a System.out.println statement.\n2. Debug to the breakpoint.\n3. Step into the println call (may go into StringBuffer first; all that matters is that you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into).\n4. A Class File Editor opens.\n5. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow.\n\nExpected results:\n- The editor should scroll one line at a time when clicking on the arrows.\n- Clicking on the scrollbar's background should scroll a page at a time.\n\nActual results:\n- The editor only scrolls one pixel at a time when clicking on the arrows.\n- Clicking on the scrollbar's background only scrolls about a line at a time. Grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well."}
