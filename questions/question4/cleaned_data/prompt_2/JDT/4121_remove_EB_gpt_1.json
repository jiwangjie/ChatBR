  "OB": "When exporting a directory (project) and placing the exported JAR in the same directory (project), an 'out of sync' message is triggered upon overwriting the exported JAR file for the second time. This was observed on PA (8/17/01 2:03:29 PM).",
  "EB": "The exported JAR should not trigger an 'out of sync' message when overwritten multiple times in the same directory.",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the project on PA (8/17/01 2:03:29 PM).\n2. Export a directory (project) to a JAR file.\n3. Place the exported JAR in the same directory (project).\n4. Overwrite the exported JAR file for the second time.\nExpected Behavior: The overwrite process should not result in an 'out of sync' message."
