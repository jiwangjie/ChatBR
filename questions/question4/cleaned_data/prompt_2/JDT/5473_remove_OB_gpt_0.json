The first line contains a tab character and the second line is indented using spaces. There is a discrepancy between the indentation styles of the two lines, causing confusion when attempting to shift the lines left.", "EB": "To fix this issue, replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented with spaces. When executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should also be shifted left, at least until the space character (i.e., removing the tab character). This adjustment will prevent any unexpected behavior and ensure that the text is shifted correctly.", "SR": "To reproduce this bug: \n1. Open a default text editor. \n2. Type in the following: \n   <space><tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2 \n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nObserve that nothing moves as expected."}
