{"id": "8142", "title": "Bug 8142: Scoped type hierarchy not available on binary projects", "description": "When trying to view the scoped type hierarchy on binary projects (e.g., org.apache.ant), I encounter the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. Could you please provide clarification on the meaning of this message?", "OB": "The scoped type hierarchy is not showing the class hierarchies of the internal jars for binary projects like org.apache.ant. Instead, the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant' is displayed.", "EB": "", "SR": "Please modify the scoped type hierarchy feature to display the class hierarchies of the internal jars for binary projects."}
