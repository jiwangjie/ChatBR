{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "The All Types dialog in JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd'). These obfuscated classes should be less prominent in the dialog.", "OB": "The All Types dialog in JDK 1.4 shows obfuscated classes (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') with the same visibility as other classes.", "EB": "The obfuscated classes in the All Types dialog should have reduced visibility to distinguish them from non-obfuscated classes.", "SR": "To address this issue, I suggest either a) sorting the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter, or b) filtering out the obfuscated classes completely."}
