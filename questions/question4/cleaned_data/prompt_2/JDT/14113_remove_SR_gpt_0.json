{"id": "14113", "title": "Bug 14113: Listening to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas", "description": "When changing the attached source of a jar, currently a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired, which is incorrect. As a result, the UI closes the class file editors opened on this jar, which is appropriate for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when I tried to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI did not react. I believe that in this case, the UI should refresh the class file editor to obtain the new source. Therefore, I will fire a (FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH | FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta for now, and I will remove the FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH when this bug is fixed.", "OB": "Build 20020416", "EB": "The UI should refresh the class file editor to obtain the new source when a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta occurs.", "SR": ""}
