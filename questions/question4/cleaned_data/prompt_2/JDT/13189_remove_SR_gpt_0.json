[Add more steps or observations to provide a clear context for the issue.]", "OB": "When trying to delete fields, the context menu is not shown. Instead, a message dialog appears asking if I want to delete the getter/setter as well.", "EB": "The expected behavior should be that the context menu is displayed when trying to delete fields, allowing the user to choose the desired action. The message dialog should not override the context menu.", "SR": "Ensure that the context menu appears when attempting to delete fields, and the message dialog asking about deleting getter/setter is displayed only after selecting the appropriate option from the context menu."}
