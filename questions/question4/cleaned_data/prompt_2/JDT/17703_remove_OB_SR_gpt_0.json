{"id": "17703", "title": "Bug 17703: Edit->Add Task action should use Workbench dialog as Java Editor does", "description": "When using the 'Edit->Add Task' action in the IDE, the current behavior is not consistent between different editors. Currently, when using the action in the Java editor, a specific dialog is displayed to enter the task details. However, in other editors, such as the text editor, the task is added directly without any additional dialog. This inconsistency can be confusing and inefficient for users.", "OB": "Currently, when using the 'Edit->Add Task' action in the IDE, there is no consistent behavior between different editors. In the Java editor, a dialog is displayed to enter the task details, while in other editors the task is added directly without any additional dialog.", "EB": "When using the 'Edit->Add Task' action in the IDE, the behavior should be consistent across all editors. The same dialog that is used in the Java editor should be used in other editors as well, allowing users to enter task details regardless of the editor they are using.", "SR": "Update the 'Edit->Add Task' action in the IDE to use the same dialog for entering task details across all editors."}
