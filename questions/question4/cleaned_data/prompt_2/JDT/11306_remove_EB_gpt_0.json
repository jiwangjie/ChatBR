This is very handy.", "OB": "When the user answers yes to create a new project in the new class wizard, the resulting dialog is the first page of the generic new project wizard instead of the expected Java Project wizard.", "EB": "The new class wizard should open the Java Project wizard when the user chooses to create a new project.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: In a new workspace, press the \"New Class\" button in the Java perspective and verify if the resulting dialog is the first page of the generic new project wizard."}
