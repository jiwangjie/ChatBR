{"id": "6322", "title": "All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "The Open Type dialog in JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (e.g., a, a1, b, c, d), which are shown prominently. This makes it difficult to find the desired classes.", "OB": "The obfuscated classes are displayed prominently in the Open Type dialog.", "EB": "The obfuscated classes should not be displayed in the Open Type dialog.", "SR": "To address this issue, I suggest two options: a) Sort the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter. b) Completely filter out the obfuscated classes from the dialog. I recommend implementing option a)."}
