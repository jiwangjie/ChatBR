Currently, it does not provide an option to remove the existing content.", "EB": "To address this issue, I suggest renaming the action and the dialog to 'Recreate Test Suite'. This would clarify the purpose of the action and avoid confusion about the removal of existing content.", "SR": "Modify the 'Update Test Suite' action to show the existing content and provide an option to remove it if desired. Consider renaming the action and the dialog to 'Recreate Test Suite' for better clarity."}
