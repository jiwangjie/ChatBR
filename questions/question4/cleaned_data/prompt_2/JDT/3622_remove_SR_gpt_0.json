{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "The New Package Wizard displays a confusing message when the package name field is empty. The message states 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message appears even before any input is entered in the package name field. This behavior raises questions about its meaning and whether it is an error. Additionally, it is suggested that if this message indicates an error, it should be displayed in red with an error icon. EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM) observed that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM) confirmed that it is a warning and mentioned that the message will be removed. EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM) further inquired about creating a default package as it cannot be initiated by the user since it is always present.", "OB": "When attempting to create a new Java package, a message stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top of the New Package Wizard, even when the package name field is empty.", "EB": "When attempting to create a new Java package, a message stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top of the New Package Wizard, even before any input is entered in the package name field.
