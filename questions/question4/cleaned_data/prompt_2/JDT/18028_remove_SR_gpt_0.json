{"id": "18028", "title": "Bug 18028: Rename package doesn't check if all resources are writeable", "description": "When trying to rename a package in the system, the system does not check if all resources within the package are writeable. As a result, if a code unit (CU) within the package is set to read-only, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed after the rename process is complete.", "OB": "1. Create a package with a code unit (CU) inside it. \n2. Set the CU as read-only. \n3. Try to rename the package. \n4. Observe: After the renaming process is complete, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "EB": "The precondition checking for the package rename process should include a check for read-only files within the package. If any files are found to be read-only, the system should prevent the rename process from proceeding and show an appropriate error message to the user.", "SR": ""}
