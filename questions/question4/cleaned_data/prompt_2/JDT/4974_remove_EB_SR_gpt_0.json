The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. By setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "OB": "Pressing Ok results in the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "The error message should instead be: 'Setting the output location and classpath separately creates an illegal state.'", "SR": "Implement a single operation that sets both the classpath and output location simultaneously to avoid creating an illegal state."}
