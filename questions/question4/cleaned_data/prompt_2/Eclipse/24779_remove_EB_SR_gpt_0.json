When a perspective that is not currently displayed contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of Eclipse until the perspective is displayed at least once. Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the 'java' perspective.\n3. Restart Eclipse.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nAfter removing the plugin, when Eclipse is closed and restarted, the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message should not be displayed anymore.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter closing and restarting Eclipse, the same 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed. It is not clear why we are still getting this error message and why the workbench tries to create this view again.", "OB": "When a perspective that is not currently displayed contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of Eclipse until the perspective is displayed at least once.", "EB": "After removing the plugin, when Eclipse is closed and restarted, the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message should not be displayed anymore.", "SR": "Investigate why the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is still displayed even after removing the plugin. Ensure that workbench does not attempt to create the invalid view again after it has been removed."}
