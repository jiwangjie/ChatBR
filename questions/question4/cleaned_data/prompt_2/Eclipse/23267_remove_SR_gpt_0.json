{"id": "23267", "title": "Bug 23267[Import/Export] Import Project should have a default folder", "description": "When importing an existing Eclipse project on XP and clicking the Browse button, a dialog is displayed that does not have a good default folder. It shows the desktop, my computer, etc. It would be better if there was a default content location for the dialog to point to. Additionally, it would be helpful if the dialog could remember the last folder from which I imported a project.", "OB": "When importing an existing Eclipse project on XP and clicking the Browse button, the dialog should have a default folder to provide a better starting point for the user. This could be the default content location.", "EB": "The dialog should remember the last folder from which a project was imported, providing a more convenient experience for the user.", "SR": "Please update the Import Project dialog to have a default folder, such as the default content location, and make it remember the last folder used for importing projects."}
