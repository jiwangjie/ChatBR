{"id": "18335", "title": "Bug 18335 - Perspective contents lost when view is maximized", "description": "When a view is maximized in any perspective in F1, all the contents of the perspective (including views and layout information) are lost. It seems that the code for maximizing a view replaces the page layout with a temporary layout that only contains the maximized view. This temporary layout is not being properly persisted when the workbench is closed, resulting in the loss of the proper layout.", "OB": "When a view is maximized in any perspective, all other views and layout information are missing except for the maximized view.", "EB": "The temporary layout used when maximizing a view should not be persisted when the workbench is closed. Instead, the proper layout should be restored upon reopening the workbench.", "SR": "Ensure that the proper layout is restored when reopening the workbench after maximizing a view in any perspective."}
