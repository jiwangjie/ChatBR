Instead, the previously opened editor remains active.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the scripted resource editor example in a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file and name it 'test.xml'.\n3. Select 'test.xml' in the Navigator.\n4. Choose 'Open With...' and select 'Default Text Editor'.\n5. Observations: The file 'test.xml' does not open with the 'Default Text Editor'. Instead, the scripted resource editor example remains active.\n\nThe expected behavior is that the 'test.xml' file opens in a new editor when a different editor type is chosen."}
