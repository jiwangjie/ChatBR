{"id": "18016", "title": "Most menu actions should be disabled for cus from repo", "description": "When cus from the repository are selected, most menu actions should be disabled. Currently, there are 6 menu entries enabled - 'open declaration', 'open type hierarchy', 'open super implementation', 'show in packages view', 'copy', and 'search'. However, none of them perform any action. Only the 'copy' menu entry could potentially be made to mean something, but it currently does not work. This issue is likely to happen to many users.", "OB": "When cus from the repository are selected, there are 6 menu entries enabled - 'open declaration', 'open type hierarchy', 'open super implementation', 'show in packages view', 'copy', and 'search'.
