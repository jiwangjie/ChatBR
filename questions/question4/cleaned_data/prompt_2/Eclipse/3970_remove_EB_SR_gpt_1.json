  "OB": "When creating a new file, we currently use the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). However, this may not always align with the user's preference.",
  "EB": "A user-friendly preference setting in the Eclipse preferences panel should be implemented to allow users to define the default line delimiters for new files, providing a more customizable experience.",
  "SR": "1. Open Eclipse.\n2. Navigate to the preferences panel.\n3. Look for a new 'Line Delimiters' section.\n4. Provide options to set default line delimiters for new files.\n5. Create a new file and observe that the selected line delimiters are applied."
