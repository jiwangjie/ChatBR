This issue can be reproduced using the following steps:\n\n1. Start eclipse.\n2. Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif.\n3. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif'.\n4. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif'.\n5. Open the about dialog.\n\nUpon observation, there is no main image displayed. This suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but the \"$nl$\" path segment is not being handled correctly.", "OB": "Open the about dialog.

Copy the file <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif down into an NL-specific subdirectory, i.e., move it to <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/nl/en/eclipselg.gif.\n3.
