{"id": "12906", "title": "Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] Unable to open file in another editor if it is already opened (should display error message)", "description": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open it in another editor does nothing. This should instead display a warning message in the workbench, informing the user that opening the file in another editor may cause changes to be overwritten, and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message can be displayed, indicating that all files need to be closed first. This is believed to be a safety feature in WSAD that prevents external editing while a file is already opened in WSAD.", "OB": "Open the Java Perspective and double click on a java file to open it in the workbench. Right click on the same file and select 'Open With .. System Editor'. Currently, nothing happens, but a warning message or error message should be displayed as described in the description.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
