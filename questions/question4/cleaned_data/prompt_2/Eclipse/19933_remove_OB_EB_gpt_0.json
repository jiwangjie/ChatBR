However, the action could have written to the status line. We currently do not have the API necessary to get the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. The problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When running in with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode.", "EB": "When running with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line should not have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode.", "SR": "Build 20020611: Improve the keybinding service in Emacs to prevent the status line message from being cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. When a mode is entered, the key sequence that started the mode should be written to the status line."}
