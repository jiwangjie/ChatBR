{"id": "BUG19933", "title": "Emacs keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When running with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, the action could have written to the status line. Currently, we do not have the necessary API to retrieve the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. Nevertheless, the problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When a mode is entered, the key sequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "Currently, there is no proposed solution for this bug.", "SR": "The bug occurs in Build 20020611."}
