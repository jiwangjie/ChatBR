  "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in Property Sheet",
  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...",
  "OB": "ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet.",
  "EB": "ComboBoxCellEditor should resize appropriately within the property sheet, ensuring the drop-down button is always visible.",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns.\n3. Define each column using IPropertyDescriptor.\n4. Use IPropertyDescriptor's method to create a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n5. Include strings in the constructor for the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n6. Observe that the editor appears in column two of the property sheet.\n7. Note that if any string is wider than the column, the combo box grows to the width of the largest item.\n8. Observe that the drop-down button may be too far right and off the visible area, getting clipped.\n9. Experience the inconvenience where users can no longer see the combo drop-down button without widening the property sheet view until the button comes into the visible area."
