Problems with 'Go Into' action ", "OB": "When performing the following steps:\n1. Start with a clean F1 build.\n2. Import all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects.\n3. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant).\n4. Use 'Go Into', 'Go Up', 'Go Back', 'Go Back' actions, which all work fine.\n5. Close the project.\n\nObserved behavior: The 'Forward' action is still enabled, but the first 'Forward' goes to a blank screen. Clicking it doesn't seem to do anything. Additionally, notice that the 'Go Into' action is now disabled.", "EB": "It is possible that closing projects should clean up the history, or some text should appear in the Navigator view indicating that the project is closed. \n\nFurther problem: After having some history, open another project (e.g., org.eclipse.lucene) and select a folder (e.g., 'bin'). The 'Go Into' action is still enabled.", "SR": ""}
