[Provide the steps to reproduce the bug here.]", "OB": "N/A", "EB": "When attempting to export multiple files with the same file name under different directories to a zip file, the export process fails. For example, if there are two files named 'foo.txt' located in different directories (e.g., project 1 and project 2), the export process fails when adding the second 'foo.txt' file to the zip file. However, if the second file is renamed to 'foo2.txt' in project 2, there are no problems and the export process succeeds.", "SR": "The zip file should be able to properly store files with the same name under different directories, allowing for successful export."}
