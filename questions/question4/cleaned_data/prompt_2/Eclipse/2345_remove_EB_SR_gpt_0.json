{"id": "2345", "title": "Bug 2345 - Open with a different type of editor has no effect if file already open", "description": "When attempting to open a file with a different type of editor after it is already open, the action has no effect. This issue is reproducible by following the steps in Bug 1GEWMOZ, specifically the ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example. Here are the steps to reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new basic project. 2. Create a new file called test.xml. 3. The editor used by default is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content. 4. In the Navigator, select test.xml. 5. Choose 'Open With...' and then 'Default Text Editor'. 6. The expected behavior is for a new editor to be opened on the file since the editor type is different. However, nothing happens and the scripted resource editor example remains active. It is important to note that searching for an existing open file should also take into consideration the editor types.", "OB": "1. Create a new basic project. 2. Create a new file called test.xml. 3.
