{"id": "18915", "title": "Bug 18915 - [Preferences] switching between erroneous preference pages should generate an error instead of a warning", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "When I enter invalid data on any preference page and it is flagged in the UI, if I try to select another page without fixing the problem, a warning dialog is displayed saying 'The currently displayed page contains invalid values'. This warning dialog should be an error dialog instead, since users should not be allowed to leave the page without fixing the mistake."}
