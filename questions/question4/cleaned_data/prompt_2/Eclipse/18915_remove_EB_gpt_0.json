This warning dialog should be an error dialog instead, as it is not allowed to navigate away from the page without fixing the error.", "EB": "", "SR": "Modify the warning dialog that is displayed when attempting to navigate away from a preference page with invalid data. Change the dialog from a warning dialog to an error dialog, to signify that leaving the page without fixing the error is not allowed. The new error dialog should display an appropriate message."}
