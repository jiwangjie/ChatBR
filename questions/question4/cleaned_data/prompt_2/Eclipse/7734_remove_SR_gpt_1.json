  "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings",
  "description": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.",
  "OB": "When shutting down Windows with a WSWB session open and a dirty .txt file, there is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their changes in the .txt file. The computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that a dialog box should appear, providing a 'Do you want to save your file?' prompt with options Yes, No, and Cancel. Selecting Cancel should halt the shutdown process. This behavior is consistent with other Windows programs like Word, Outlook, etc.",
  "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu, select 'Shut Down' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n5. Verify that there is no warning or question message box, and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately."
