  "description": "When attempting to find images and files in NL-specific subdirectories, the issue arises in build 200205291235. The problem seems to be related to the handling of the \"$nl$\" path segment when passed to IPluginDescriptor.find. Follow the steps below to reproduce and observe the behavior.",
  "OB": "Upon opening the about dialog, a main image is present, indicating that the UI correctly passes the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find. However, the \"$nl$\" path segment is not handled correctly, leading to the issue.",
