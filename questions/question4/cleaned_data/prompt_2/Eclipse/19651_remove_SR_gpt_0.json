It was present in step 9 of the process. Please note that TestClass.java is not in any CVS repository, but the problem was initially observed with a file managed by CVS.", "OB": "The team menu is missing from the package view of the TestClass. To reproduce the issue: 1) Close the two new windows. 2) Select the TestClass in the package view and right-click to open the popup menu. The team menu should be visible but it is not.", "EB": "To reproduce the issue (again): 1) Select the word InnerClass in the text editor and press F4. 2) Right-click to open the popup menu on the new hierarchy view. The team menu is not present, which is expected since it is an inner class. 3) Select the word TestClass in the new text editor and press F4. The team menu is not there, but it should be, as it is not an inner class. 4) At this point, there should be 3 opened windows.", "SR": ""}
