After removing the welcome page from the prefstore.ini file of the workbench metadata, clicking on any link in the welcome page executes the appropriate action, but the clicked link is not visually selected when returning to the welcome page. This inconsistency should be resolved by making sure that links are selected when clicked, providing more context to the user when they return to the welcome page. The ProductInfoDialog dialog already implements this functionality.", "EB": "There is currently no error or unexpected behavior to report.", "SR": "Implement the functionality to select links when clicked in the welcome page to provide consistent visual feedback to the user."}
