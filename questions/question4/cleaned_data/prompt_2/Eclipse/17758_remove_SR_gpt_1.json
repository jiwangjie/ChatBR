  "OB": "From a clean F1 build, import all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant). Perform 'Go Into,' 'Go Up,' 'Go Back,' 'Go Back' – works fine. Close the project. 'Forward' is still enabled, but the first forward goes to a blank screen. Click it, and it doesn't seem to do anything. Notice now 'Go Into' is disabled.",
  "EB": "Perhaps closing projects should clean up the history, or some text should appear in Navigator View, such as 'project is closed.' Further problem: with some history now, open up another project (e.g., org.eclipse.lucene) and select a folder (e.g., 'bin'). 'Go Into' is enabled.",
