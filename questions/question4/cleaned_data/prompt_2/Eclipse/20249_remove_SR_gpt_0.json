{"id": "20249", "title": "Bug 20249[Help] Change editor/view/perspective F1 help", "description": "The F1 help for the change editor, change viewer, and change perspective menus is not functioning correctly. When the change editor menu is open and F1 is pressed, the help window pops up, but immediately closes before the user can read the contents. This same issue applies to the change viewer and change perspective menus. Additionally, none of the actions listed under Window -> Keyboard Shortcuts have any F1 help defined to describe their functionality.", "OB": "When the change editor menu is open, pressing F1 should display the help window, which should remain open for the user to read the contents.", "EB": "If there is no F1 help defined for a specific menu, pressing F1 should not display anything to prevent the help window from constantly popping up and closing.", "SR": "Ensure that the F1 help functionality for the change editor, change viewer, and change perspective menus is fixed so that the help window remains open for the user to read the contents. Additionally, add F1 help descriptions for all actions listed under Window -> Keyboard Shortcuts."}
