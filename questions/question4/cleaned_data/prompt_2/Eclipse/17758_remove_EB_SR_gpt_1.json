  "OB": "From a clean F1 build, import all plugins from the runtime environment to load some projects. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant). Use 'Go Into,' 'Go Up,' 'Go Back,' and 'Go Back' - everything works fine. Close the project. The 'Forward' button is still enabled, but the first forward action leads to a blank screen. Click it, and it appears to do nothing. Notice that 'Go Into' is now disabled.",
  "EB": "After performing the described steps, the 'Go Into' action should remain consistently enabled, and the 'Forward' action should navigate to the expected screens without any issues.",
