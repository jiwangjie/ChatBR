This can be observed by checking the File menu MRU list. The files appear in the list during the current session, but do not appear in the list when the application is restarted. The expected behavior is that the MRU list should persist between sessions.", "EB": "", "SR": "Implement the use of IPersistableElement to ensure the MRU File List is persisted between sessions. Avoid accessing the underlying resource directly and make sure the IEditorInput is considered even if it is not a resource."}
