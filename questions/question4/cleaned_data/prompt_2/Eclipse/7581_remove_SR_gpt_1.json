  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ",
  "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet.",
  "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should behave the same as DialogCellEditor (Button always visible). Will need to investigate to determine if this is an issue with our implementation or with SWT.",
  "SR": "1. Open the property sheet with a column that uses ComboBoxCellEditor.\n2. Observe that the combo box does not size correctly based on the property sheet column width.\n3. Compare this behavior with DialogCellEditor to note the difference in sizing.\n4. Investigate whether the issue is related to our implementation or the SWT library."
