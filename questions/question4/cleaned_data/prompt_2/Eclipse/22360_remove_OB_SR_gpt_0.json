{"id": "22360", "title": "Bug 22360[Fonts] FontRegistry cannot be instantiated using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource", "description": "When trying to instantiate FontRegistry using resources outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource path, it fails. Currently, all the resources being looked up are only relative to the location of the FontRegistry class in the org.eclipse.jface.resource path. To address this issue, the FontRegistry should accept a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter in the constructor.", "OB": "The FontRegistry should allow clients to load their own resource bundle and provide it as a parameter in the constructor instead of just the name of the bundle.", "EB": "Alternatively, FontRegistry can be modified to allow clients to load their own resource bundle and pass it as a parameter to the constructor (in addition to the bundle name).", "SR": ""}
