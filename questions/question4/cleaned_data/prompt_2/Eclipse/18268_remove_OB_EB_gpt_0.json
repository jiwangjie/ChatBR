To reproduce:\n1. Start eclipse.\n2. Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif.\n3.

Open the about dialog.\n\nObservation: The main image is not displayed in the about dialog. This suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but the \"$nl$\" path segment is not being handled correctly.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "To resolve this issue, follow these steps:\n1.
