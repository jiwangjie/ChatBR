{"id": "19933", "title": "Emacs: Keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When running in Emacs keybindings mode, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by the AcceleratorScope.resetMode function. However, the actions could have written to the status line. Currently, we do not have the necessary API to retrieve the message in the status line, making it impossible to solve the problem in general. However, the problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "Build 20020611", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Modify AcceleratorScope.resetMode function to not clear the status line when running in the default mode.\n\n2. Develop an API to retrieve the message in the status line, allowing for a more general solution to the problem."}
