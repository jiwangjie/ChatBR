However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. A UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for the line delimiter should include: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure that all plugins use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "Implement a UI in the Workbench to allow users to define the default line delimiter for new files. The UI should include options for Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. All plugins should be updated to use the selected line delimiter for new files."}
