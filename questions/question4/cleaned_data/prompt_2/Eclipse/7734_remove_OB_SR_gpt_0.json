{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "When the system is being shut down, there are no warnings or prompts to save any open files. It would be beneficial to have a dialog box that asks the user if they want to save their file before proceeding with the shutdown. This dialog box should have options for Yes, No, and Cancel. If the user selects Cancel, the shutdown should be halted. It would also be helpful to allow the applications to control the shutdown/save process, or to allow them to display their own windows that would also give the user the option to stop the shutdown if Cancel is selected.", "OB": "Currently, there are no savefile warnings when the system is shut down.", "EB": "The system should provide a dialog box asking the user if they want to save their file before shutting down. The dialog box should have options for Yes, No, and Cancel.

This dialog box should have options for Yes, No, and Cancel. If Cancel is selected, the shutdown process should be halted."}
