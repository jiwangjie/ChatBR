When a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), a \"Unable to restore perspective\" error message is displayed after each launch of eclipse, until the perspective is displayed one time. The 'java' perspective is displayed. Restart eclipse. A \"Unable to restore perspective ...\" error message is displayed, which is fine, as we just remove the plugin. Close and restart eclipse. The same 'Unable to restore perspective ...' error message is displayed. Why do we still get this error message? Why does the workbench try to create this view again?", "OB": "The workbench should remove the reference to the invalid view when the corresponding plugin is removed.", "EB": "The plugin was not available the last time eclipse was closed, so the workbench should no longer have a reference to this plugin.", "SR": ""}
