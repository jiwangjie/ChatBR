This issue arises when following the steps below:\n\n1. Start Eclipse\n2. Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif>\n3. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini> and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif'\n4. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini> and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif'\n5. Open the about dialog\n\nUpon observation, it is evident that the UI correctly passes the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but the '$nl$' path segment is not handled correctly, resulting in the main image not being displayed.", "OB": "Open the about dialog and observe that the main image is not displayed.", "EB": "The UI should handle the '$nl$' path segment correctly and display the main image in the about dialog.", "SR": "Implement proper handling of the '$nl$' path segment in the UI to ensure that the main image is displayed correctly in the about dialog."}
