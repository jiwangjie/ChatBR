{"id": "19933", "title": "Emacs: keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When using Emacs keybindings, the keybinding service always clears the status line. However, there are cases where the action could have written a message to the status line. Currently, we do not have the necessary API to retrieve the message from the status line, making it impossible to solve the problem in general. However, in some cases, we can avoid clearing the status line by not doing so when running in the default mode.", "OB": "The keybinding service always clears the status line, regardless of whether an action has written a message to it or not.", "EB": "When using Emacs keybindings, the keybinding service clears the status line by calling AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, this behavior is not always desirable as it may remove important messages from the status line.", "SR": "In build 20020611, when running with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have its message cleared by the keybinding service. To avoid this issue, we should modify AcceleratorScope.resetMode to only clear the status line in certain situations, preserving important messages. Additionally, when a mode is entered, we should display the key sequence that started the mode on the status line."}
