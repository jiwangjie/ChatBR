This causes a flashing effect. The same issue occurs for the change viewer and change perspective menus. Additionally, none of the actions under Window > Keyboard Shortcuts have any F1 help defined to describe their functionality.", "OB": "When pressing F1 in the editor, view, or perspective, the F1 help is displayed even if it is not defined, causing a flashing effect.", "EB": "When pressing F1 in the editor, view, or perspective, the F1 help should only be displayed if it is defined. This will prevent any flashing effects. The change viewer and change perspective menus should also behave in the same way. Furthermore, F1 help should be defined for the actions under Window > Keyboard Shortcuts to describe their functionality.", "SR": "Ensure that the F1 help is only displayed when it is defined for the editor, view, and perspective. Implement this behavior for the change viewer and change perspective menus as well. Define F1 help for the actions under Window > Keyboard Shortcuts to provide users with an explanation of their functionality."}
