Currently, if a non-displayed perspective contains an invalid view (where the corresponding plugin has been removed), upon each launch of Eclipse, an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed until the perspective is displayed once. However, even after removing the plugin, when Eclipse is closed and restarted, the same 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is still displayed. This behavior seems incorrect. ", "OB": "To observe this issue: 1. Open Eclipse and ensure the 'java' perspective is displayed. 3. Restart Eclipse. You will see an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message, which is expected since we have removed the corresponding plugin. 6. Close and restart Eclipse. The same 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed again. This is unexpected as the plugin has been removed. ", "EB": "To reproduce this issue: 2. Open a view that belongs to a plugin that can be easily added and removed (e.g., EditorList plugin). 5. Switch to another perspective (e.g., 'Java' perspective).  You now have two opened perspectives. 4. Remove or move the plugin. 5. Switch back to the perspective that contains the view no longer exists. You will encounter the same 'Unable to restore perspective' error message. Finally, close and restart Eclipse where no more error messages will be displayed. ", "SR": ""}
