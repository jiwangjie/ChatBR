However, none of them perform any action. The enabled menu entries are: open declaration, open type hierarchy, open super implementation, show in packages view, copy, and search. It seems that the copy option is supposed to have a functionality, but it doesn't work currently (see bug 18015). This issue is marked as major and is likely to affect many users.
