  "title": "Bug 2120MRU File List is not persisted between sessions (1GE71Z0)",
  "description": "The MRU (Most Recently Used) File List is not persisting between sessions as expected. Files that were opened and appeared in the File menu MRU list during one session do not reappear in subsequent sessions. The desired behavior is for these files to be persisted between sessions. It's important to note that the issue may be related to the use of IPersistableElement and not directly peeking into the implementation to access the underlying resource, as the IEditorInput may not necessarily be a resource.",
  "OB": "Files opened in the previous session and listed in the File menu MRU list do not reappear when the workbench is restarted.",
  "EB": "The MRU File List should persist between sessions, ensuring that files opened in one session are still listed in the File menu MRU list after restarting the workbench.",
  "SR": "1. Start the workbench.\n2. Open 2 or 3 files.\n3. Shutdown the workbench.\n4. Restart the workbench.\n5. Check the File menu MRU list to observe whether the previously opened files are listed."
