Therefore, all the resources being looked up are only relative to the location of the FontRegistry class in the org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter in the constructor.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "When I try to create a FontRegistry instance for my application using the code snippet below, I get a MissingResourceException: com.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry() {\n   FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nI do have a file called fonts.properties in my com/company/product/folder. However, if I try the following code instead:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry() {\n   ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nThere is no exception.\n\nFurthermore, if I create a complete copy of the FontRegistry class in my com.company.product package, then it works.\n\nMy guess is that this is a bug in the FontRegistry."}
