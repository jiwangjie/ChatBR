Additionally, the actions under Window > Keyboard Shortcuts should have clear F1 help defined to describe their functionality.", "SR": "The help window for the change editor menu should stay open when F1 is pressed, allowing the user to read the help contents. If F1 help is intended for the change editor menu, it should be clearly displayed and readable."}
