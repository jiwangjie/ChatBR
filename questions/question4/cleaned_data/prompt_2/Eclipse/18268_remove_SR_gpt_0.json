{"id": "18268", "title": "Bug 18268 not finding images and files in NL-specific subdirectories", "description": "When starting Eclipse, if the <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif> file is deleted and the value of the aboutImage property in <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini> is changed to 'aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif', the UI correctly passes the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but the '$nl$' path segment is not handled correctly. This results in the main image not being displayed in the about dialog. This issue can be reproduced by following these steps:\n1. Start Eclipse.\n2. Delete the <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif> file.\n3. Edit the <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini> file and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif'.\n4. Open the about dialog.", "OB": "Observe: There is a main image displayed in the about dialog.", "EB": "Open the about dialog.\nObserve: There is no main image displayed.\nExpectation: The main image should have been found in the specified location.", "SR": "The issue pertains to the handling of the '$nl$' path segment when passing the path to IPluginDescriptor.find. This needs to be investigated and resolved to ensure that images are correctly found in NL-specific subdirectories."}
