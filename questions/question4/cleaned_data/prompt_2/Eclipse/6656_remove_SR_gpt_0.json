{"id": "6656", "title": "Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "On linux, running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000). When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "OB": "The close button and the pulldown menu icon (triangle) move below the label when the view like the Navigator is resized smaller.", "EB": "Previously, the close button and the pulldown menu icon (triangle) used to stay on the same line as the label no matter how small the view got. This is a usability problem because users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": "Ensure that the close button and the pulldown menu icon (triangle) stay on the same line as the label when the view like the Navigator is resized smaller."}
