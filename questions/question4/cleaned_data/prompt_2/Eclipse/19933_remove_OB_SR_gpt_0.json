{"id": "19933", "title": "Emacs: keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When using Emacs, the keybinding service consistently clears the status line. However, there are cases where the action should have written to the status line. Currently, we do not have the necessary API to retrieve the message in the status line, making it impossible to solve the problem in general. However, the problem can be addressed for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "The keybinding service always clears the status line, even when the action should have written to it.", "EB": "AcceleratorScope.resetMode is meant to clean up the status line once the appropriate action has been executed.", "SR": "Consider modifying the keybinding service to not clear the status line when running in the default mode to allow actions to write to the status line."}
