  "title": "Bug 18335: Perspective contents lost when view is maximized",
  "description": "When maximizing a view within any perspective in F1, all perspective contents (including views and layout information) are lost except for the maximized view. It seems that the view maximize code replaces the page layout with a temporary one that contains only the maximized view.",
  "OB": "After maximizing a view in any perspective, only the maximized view remains visible, and all other views within the perspective disappear.",
  "EB": "Upon maximizing a view, all views within the perspective should remain visible alongside the maximized view, retaining their original layout.",
  "SR": "1. Open any perspective in F1.\n2. Maximize a view within the perspective.\n3. Observe that all other views within the perspective disappear, leaving only the maximized view visible."
