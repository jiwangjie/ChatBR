Currently, it only looks for resources relative to the location of the FontRegistry class. This issue could be resolved by allowing FontRegistry to take a client class or class loader as an additional parameter in the constructor.", "OB": "The FontRegistry class should be able to load resources outside of the org.eclipse.jface.resource path.", "EB": "Alternatively, the FontRegistry class could provide a way for clients to load their own resource bundle and pass it as a parameter to the constructor, instead of relying on the name of the bundle.", "SR": "I encountered a MissingResourceException when trying to create an instance of the FontRegistry class for my application. The code I used is as follows:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nI have a file named fonts.properties in the com/company/product folder. However, when I try the following code instead:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nNo exception is thrown. Additionally, if I create a complete copy of the FontRegistry class in my com.company.product package, it works. This leads me to believe that there is a bug in the FontRegistry class."}
