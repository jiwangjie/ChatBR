Problems with 'Go Into' action", "OB": "The 'Go Into' action in the Navigator View does not have the expected behavior. After closing a project, the history is not cleaned up and no indication is provided in the Navigator View to indicate that the project is closed. Another problem is observed when opening a new project and selecting a folder, the 'Go Into' action remains enabled.", "EB": "The 'Go Into' action should clean up the history when a project is closed. Additionally, a text indicating that the project is closed should appear in the Navigator View. When opening a new project, the 'Go Into' action should not be enabled if no folder is selected.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Perform a clean F1 build\n2. Import all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects\n3. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant)\n4. Use the 'Go Into', 'Go Up', 'Go Back', 'Go Back' actions and observe that they work fine\n5. Close the project\n6.
