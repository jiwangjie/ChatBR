To reproduce: 1. Start Eclipse. 2. Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif. 3. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif'. 4. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif'. 5. Open the about dialog. Observations: There is a main image again. This suggests that the UI correctly passes the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but the '$nl$' path segment is not handled correctly.", "OB": "", "EB": "To reproduce: 1. Start Eclipse. 2.

Copy the file <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif down into an NL-specific subdirectory, i.e., move it to <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/nl/en/eclipselg.gif. 3. Start Eclipse again."}
