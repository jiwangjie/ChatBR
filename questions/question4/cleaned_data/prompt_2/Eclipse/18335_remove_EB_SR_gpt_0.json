Maximize a view in any perspective.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- The maximized view should be present and all other views in the perspective should remain visible.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- All the contents of the perspective (views, layout info) are lost when a view is maximized. Only the maximized view is actually present and all other views are missing from the perspective.\n\nAdditional Information:\n- It appears that the view maximize code replaces the page layout with a temporary one that contains only the maximized view."}
