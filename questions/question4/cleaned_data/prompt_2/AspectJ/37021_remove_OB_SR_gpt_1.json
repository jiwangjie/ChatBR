  "title": "Bug 37021 - Incorrect Source Path in Declare Warning on Binary Files",
  "description": "When running tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/', the source path is incorrect in the declare warning for binary files in Java/AJ code. The issue stems from filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages, causing false positives. It appears that AJDT might omit filenames that make no sense to it.",
  "OB": "Declare warning messages for .class files from injars display the source path as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is for declare warning messages targeting .class files to correctly list the source path in the format 'app/Main'.",
  "SR": "1. Run tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'.\n2. Check the declare warning messages for binary files in Java/AJ code targeting .class files from injars."
