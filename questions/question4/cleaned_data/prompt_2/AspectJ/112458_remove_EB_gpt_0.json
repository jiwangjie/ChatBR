{"id": "112458", "title": "Bug 112458: Property Editor displays layout item properties in Master Page viewer mode", "description": "When switching to Master Page viewer, the Property Editor still shows the properties of layout items instead of the Master Page properties. This behavior can be confusing for customers who may inadvertently set properties without selecting the Master Page viewer first.", "OB": "Customers may mistakenly assume they are editing Master Page properties and accidentally modify layout item properties instead.", "EB": "The Property Editor should only display the properties of the selected Master Page when in Master Page viewer mode.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new report and insert a label. 2. Select the label in the design view. (The Property Editor should display the label's properties) 3. Switch to Master Page viewer. (The Property Editor should now display the properties of the Master Page, not the label)"}
