  "title": "Bug 37021 - Incorrect Source Path in Declare Warning on Binary Files",
  "description": "When running tests located in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..', there's an issue observed in declare warning messages for binary files [java|aj]. These tests have a limitation where filename checking isn't enabled during harness verification of messages, resulting in false positives for error detection. This problem was noticed in AJDT, where the filename might be omitted if it doesn't make sense within AJDT's context.",
  "OB": "Declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars show the sourcepath in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.",
  "EB": "Declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars should display the sourcepath in the format 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run tests located in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'\n2. Observe the declare warning messages for binary files [java|aj] targeting .class files from injars\n3. Note the format of the sourcepath in the warnings, currently 'app.Main.class'\n4. Expected format should be 'app/Main'"
