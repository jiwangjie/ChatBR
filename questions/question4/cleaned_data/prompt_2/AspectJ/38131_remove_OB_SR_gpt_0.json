{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the bug, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\npackage subpackage;\npublic class Test {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n         System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n   }\n}\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nAfter the compilation, a directory \"subpackage\" will be created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nThis issue does not occur with javac.\nNo big deal, really.", "OB": "There is no OB statement provided in the bug report. In order to clarify the exact expected behavior, an OB statement should be added.", "EB": "ajc should have the same behavior as javac when compiling classes from a subpackage.", "SR": "Investigate and modify ajc to include a -d option in order to correctly compile classes from a subpackage."}
