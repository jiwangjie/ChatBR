{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021: Source path wrong in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When running tests on binary files in the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory, I encountered a problem with the source path being incorrect in the declare warning messages. The problem seems to occur when targeting .class files from injars. Instead of listing the source path as 'app/Main', it is shown as 'app.Main.class'. It is also worth noting that in some cases, the filenames do not appear at all in the warning messages, although I was unable to reproduce this issue in the provided tests. This issue is not limited to the testing environment as I encountered it in AJDT as well. It is possible that AJDT omits the filename when it does not make sense in the context.", "OB": "The source path in the declare warning messages for binary files should be displayed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'. Additionally, the filenames should always be included in the warning messages.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
