According to the documentation, the outjar parameter is supposed to put the output classes in a zip file, but it doesn't make sense for it to create a zip file instead of a jar file.", "OB": "The ajc outjar command should create a valid jar file that includes the MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "If the outjar parameter is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "Make sure that the outjar command creates a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file when it is used."}
