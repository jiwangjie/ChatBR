{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 - Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode.\n\nThis issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "If a java 5 VM is started with AspectJ's load-time weaver specified multiple times using the javaagent flag, when there is an aop.xml file defined, it causes a severe issue. The AspectJ tries to reweave the already woven AspectJ code and produces an excessive amount of bytecode. When the script is wrapped twice, it generates a duplicate.", "EB": "The proposed solution is to handle the duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully. Instead of emitting massive amounts of bytecode, the system should fail and display an error message when the javaagent flag is specified multiple times.", "SR": "To avoid this issue, a fix should be implemented to handle the duplicate javaagent entries in a better way. The system should detect when the javaagent flag is specified multiple times and provide an error message indicating that it is not allowed. Additionally, it would be beneficial to fail gracefully rather than emitting excessive bytecode when encountering this situation."}
