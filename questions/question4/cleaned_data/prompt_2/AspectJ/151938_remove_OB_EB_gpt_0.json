{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938: Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode.\n\nThis issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...).", "OB": "When starting a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, the system chokes badly. It attempts to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits an excessive amount of bytecode.", "EB": "If a duplicate javaagent entry is detected using the javaagent flag when starting a Java 5 VM, the system should fail and display an appropriate error message instead of emitting excessive bytecode.", "SR": "Improve the handling of duplicate javaagent entries specified using the javaagent flag. Instead of allowing the system to choke and emit excessive bytecode, it should detect the duplicate entry and provide a clear error message."}
