{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 - Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "AspectJ should detect if the javaagent is specified more than once and give a warning, then disable all but one of the agents.", "EB": "Currently, AspectJ does not handle Duplicate javaagent entries gracefully. It would be better if AspectJ detected that it was specified more than once and gave a warning, then disabled all but one of the agents.", "SR": "Improve the handling of Duplicate javaagent entries in AspectJ to provide a warning message and automatically disable all but one of the agents to avoid potential issues."}
