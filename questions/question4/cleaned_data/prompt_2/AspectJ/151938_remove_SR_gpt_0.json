{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 - Handle Duplicate javaagent entries gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode.This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "If you start a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, it chokes badly: it tries to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits massive amounts of bytecode. If the script is wrapped twice, it can generate a duplicate.", "EB": "It would be better if AspectJ detected that the javaagent flag was specified more than once and gave a warning message. The duplicate javaagent entries should be disabled, keeping only one active.", "SR": "AspectJ should enhance its behavior to handle duplicate javaagent entries gracefully by detecting the duplication and providing a warning message. It should then disable all but one of the agents to prevent the generation of massive amounts of bytecode."}
