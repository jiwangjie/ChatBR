{"id": "151938", "title": "Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "If you start a java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, it chokes badly: it tries to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits massive amounts of bytecode. If the script is wrapped twice, it can generate a duplicate.", "EB": "The duplicate javaagent entries are not handled gracefully in the current version. Instead of failing and providing an error message, the VM tries to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits excessive amounts of bytecode.", "SR": "To handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully, if a java 5 VM is started with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, an error message should be displayed. Additionally, the script should prevent the duplicate weaving of AspectJ code and avoid generating excessive bytecode."}
