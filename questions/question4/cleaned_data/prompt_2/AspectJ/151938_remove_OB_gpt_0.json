{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode.This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "When starting a java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, it emits massive amounts of bytecode by trying to reweave the woven AspectJ code instead of giving a warning and disabling all but one of the agents.", "EB": "AspectJ should detect if it is specified more than once using the javaagent flag and give a warning. It should then disable all but one of the agents to avoid emitting excessive bytecode.", "SR": "To handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully, AspectJ should detect if it is specified more than once using the javaagent flag. If detected, it should give a warning and disable all but one of the agents to prevent the emission of excessive bytecode."}
