Additionally, we should improve the quality of the error message.", "OB": "A dialog appears with the message 'Launch failed: no main type found'. We should consider tracking resource selection in a similar way to how external tools tracks selection for variable expansion. It may be useful to combine the two mechanisms into a single mechanism.", "EB": "The error message should provide clearer guidance for the user to resolve the issue. In this case, the message should say something like 'Launch failed: No file with a main type selected'. This would indicate to the user that they need to select a resource with a main type.", "SR": ""}
