We expect that hitting the Return key should perform a Find operation, just like clicking on the Find button (which is highlighted as the default button in the Find/Replace dialog).", "OB": "Hitting the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog does not perform a Find operation on Mac OS X.", "EB": "Hitting the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog should perform a Find operation on Mac OS X.", "SR": "The Find/Replace dialog on Mac OS X should respond to the Enter/Return key and perform a Find operation when a search term is entered."}
