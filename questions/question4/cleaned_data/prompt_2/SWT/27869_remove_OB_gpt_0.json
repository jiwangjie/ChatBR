{"id": "27869", "title": "Bug 27869: StyledText overuse of Font.getFontData", "description": "Bug 27869: The StyledText widget in Redhat 8 overuses the Font.getFontData method. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that StyledText also heavily relies on the FontMetrics API. It is recommended to cache the metric information in the StyledText widget and update it only when the font is changed.", "OB": "The Font.getFontData method is unnecessarily used by the StyledText widget when it is being typed.", "EB": "I believe, and many people agree, that the StyledText widget should not use the Font.getFontData method at all when text is being typed.", "SR": "To investigate this issue, add a System.out.println statement as the first line of the Font.getFontData method. Then, run a self-hosted Eclipse and monitor the console output. I am particularly concerned about this problem because the performance of this method is significantly poorer on some platforms, such as Motif running on UTF8."}
