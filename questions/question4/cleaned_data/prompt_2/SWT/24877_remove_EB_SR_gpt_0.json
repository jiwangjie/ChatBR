{"id": "24877", "title": "Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog", "description": "When using the swt FileDialog, there is no way to retrieve the file extension that the user selected. This makes the dialog almost unusable since it is not possible to determine the correct file extension to append to the file name. This issue particularly affects scenarios where the specific file type needs to be saved or exported, such as exporting to a jar file. To address this problem, an API should be added to the FileDialog class to retrieve the 'Save as type' field selected by the user.", "OB": "The FileDialog in swt does not provide a way to obtain the file extension selected by the user. This makes it difficult for applications to determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "EB": "An enhancement should be made to the FileDialog class in swt to include a method that returns the 'Save as type' field selected by the user.", "SR": "Add a method to the FileDialog class in swt that returns the 'Save as type' field selected by the user."}
