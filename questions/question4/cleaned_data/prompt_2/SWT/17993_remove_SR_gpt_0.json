{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from previous searches. If it finds a match, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, which means the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "For me, it is very common to perform find and replace operations like this. I think the current behavior should be changed to something more simple that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed. To reproduce: Open a document so that Edit -> Find/Replace... becomes available. You shouldn't be able to perform find or replace operations with the current behavior. The behavior is similar for the 'Replace With' field.", "SR": ""}
