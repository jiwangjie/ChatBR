{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior is similar to 'autocomplete' which is commonly used in browsers. In the future, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided. For now, the behavior should be changed to something more simple, allowing a full range of find and replace operations to be performed while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, the feature should be removed. To reproduce, open a document so that Edit > Find/Replace... becomes available. Try typing something in the Find field and see if it gets replaced with a value from the history. The behavior should also be checked for the Replace With field.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry gets replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history.", "SR": "Change the behavior of the Find/Replace feature to not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Ensure that the feature allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed and respects the case of what the user types."}
