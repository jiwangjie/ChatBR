It is suggested that the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and only updated when the font is changed.", "OB": "When running eclipse and using the Java Editor, a single key stroke can cause the API Font.getFontData() to be called 13 times. This API is also overused when scrolling the StyledText and selecting text. Each Font has 7 FontData, so every time 'a' is typed in the Java Editor, 91 (7*13) FontData will be loaded.", "EB": "No explicit expected behavior is mentioned.", "SR": "Try adding a system.out.println statement in the first line of the method Font.getFontData, run a self-hosted eclipse, and watch the console. I am concerned about this problem because on some platforms, the performance of this method is very poor compared to Windows. For example, Motif running on UTF8."}
