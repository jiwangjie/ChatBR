{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build replaces the text typed in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. However, it would be better if what is typed is not automatically replaced. To improve the functionality, it is suggested to consider adding a full autocomplete feature in the future. Currently, this behavior makes it difficult to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. When using the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...), the history of recent searches is available. However, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous search entry is found in the history, it replaces the typed text with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, resulting in the case of the typed text being changed to match the value in the history.", "EB": "The text typed in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields should not be automatically replaced with values from the history.", "SR": "Consider providing a full autocomplete feature in the future to enhance the Find/Replace functionality. The search should be case sensitive and not replace the typed entry with values from the history."}
