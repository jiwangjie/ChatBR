{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage.\n\nThere is a line in the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class in the win32 version of SWT that uses Class.forName(\"org...BidiUtil\"). This line causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT, as it is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This issue is only visible when using jxeLink or a similar tool. The Eclipse and Sun's compilers do not produce an error. To resolve this issue, the reflection in the line needs to be removed.", "OB": "The usage of Class.forName(\"org...BidiUtil\") in the line causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "The line should be changed to use the 'getClass()' method on a new instance of BidiUtil to avoid using reflection. This change can be made by replacing the line above with:\n\nstatic Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);", "SR": "Replace the line 'static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);' with 'static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);'. This change should have the same effect."}
