  "description": "The current implementation of BidiUtil in win32 involves unnecessary usage of Class.forName().",
  "OB": "BidiUtil in win32 uses Class.forName() unnecessarily.",
  "EB": "Implement a private constructor for BidiUtil. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, it would be beneficial to have a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instantiation. This won't add any size as the compiler provides a free public constructor by default. The change will simply make the constructor private instead of public.",
  "SR": "Modify the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); Although untested, this modification should maintain the same functionality."
