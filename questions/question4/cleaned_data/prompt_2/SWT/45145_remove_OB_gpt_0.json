{"id": "45145", "title": "Bug 45145 Second window comes to front when using first", "description": "When using two Eclipse windows, if I switch from another application to one Eclipse window and then click on a docked view or perspective, the other window comes to the front, overlapping my other applications' windows.", "OB": "The only time a window should come to the front is if I click on it explicitly or if some behavior takes me to a widget in the other window.", "EB": "Unless I click on the Eclipse dock icon, the other window should not come to the front when I switch between Eclipse windows or interact with docked views and perspectives.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, the behavior should be modified so that the second window does not come to the front unintentionally when switching between Eclipse windows or interacting with docked views and perspectives."}
