This can be problematic when determining the correct file extension to append to the file name. As a result, the dialog becomes almost unusable. This issue can be observed when exporting to a jar file in our own product.", "OB": "The FileDialog class does not provide an API to access the 'Save as type' field that the user selected in the dialog. We need an API to retrieve this information.", "EB": "Currently, when using the FileDialog, if the user selects the 'Save as type' field as .zip and enters a file name (e.g. test), the behavior is as follows.", "SR": "1. Open the FileDialog. \n2. Select .zip in the 'Save as type' field. \n3. Enter a file name, e.g. test."}
