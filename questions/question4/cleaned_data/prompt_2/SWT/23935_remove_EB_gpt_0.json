{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree receives focus. On Linux, the text widget does not lose focus when you click on the tree. This issue is caused because the text widget is a child of the tree, resulting in platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "", "SR": "Clicking anywhere in the tree should not cause the tree to receive focus."}
