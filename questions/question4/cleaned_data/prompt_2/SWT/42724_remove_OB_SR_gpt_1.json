  "title": "Bug 42724: StyledText selection rendering issue on bidi platforms",
  "description": "On bidi platforms, the selection in StyledText is rendered incorrectly. Currently, the entire selection background is redrawn, although there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that handles creating a style range for the selection.",
  "OB": "Selection background is erroneously redrawn entirely, leading to incorrect rendering on bidi platforms.",
  "EB": "The drawLineSelectionBackground function should be used exclusively to render the special line break selection, not for the entire selection rendering.",
  "SR": "1. Open StyledText on a bidi platform.\n2. Select text within the StyledText component.\n3. Observe the incorrect rendering of the selection background.\n4. Verify that drawLineSelectionBackground is used inappropriately for the entire selection rendering."
