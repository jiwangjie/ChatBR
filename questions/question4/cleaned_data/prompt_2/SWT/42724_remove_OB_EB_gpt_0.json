When using the attached BidiUtil, there is a bug in the selection rendering code in DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground. It seems that the entire selection background is redrawn even though StyledTextRenderer.drawLine already creates a style range for the selection.", "OB": "The selection background includes unselected characters on bidi platforms when using the BidiUtil.", "EB": "", "SR": "Build 20030903 - Steps to reproduce: 1. Use the attached BidiUtil. 2. Type one English character followed by three or more Arabic/Hebrew characters. 3. Place the caret at the beginning of the line. 4.
