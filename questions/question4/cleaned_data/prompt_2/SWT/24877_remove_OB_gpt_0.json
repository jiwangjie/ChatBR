{"id": "24877", "title": "Cannot get file extension from SWT FileDialog", "description": "When using the SWT FileDialog, it is not possible to retrieve the file extension. This limitation makes the dialog difficult to use as it does not allow users to determine and append the correct file extension to the file name.", "OB": "", "EB": "The export wizard should automatically append the correct file extension to the selected file when the SWT FileDialog is used. In the provided steps, the export wizard should use the file name \"test.zip\" instead of just \"test\".", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1) Select a java file. 2) Go to File > Export. 3) Choose JAR file and click Next. 4) Click Browse... to open the Save As file dialog. 5) Enter \"test\" as the file name. 6) Select \".zip\" as the \"Save as type\" field. 7) Click Save. The result should be that the JAR export wizard automatically adds \".zip\" to the file name, resulting in \"test.zip\" being populated in the JAR file field."}
