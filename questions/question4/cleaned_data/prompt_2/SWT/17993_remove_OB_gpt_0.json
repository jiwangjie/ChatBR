{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Invalid search behavior in Find/Replace feature", "description": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry in the Find or Replace With fields is replaced with a value from the search history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete commonly seen in browsers. However, the desired behavior should allow for a full range of find and replace operations, while respecting the case of the user input. To reproduce, open a document and select Edit > Find/Replace... The issue also affects the Replace With field. ", "OB": "The current behavior is to replace the typed entry with a value from the history, which limits the search capabilities and does not respect the case of the user input. This behavior should be changed to allow for a full range of find and replace operations.", "EB": "The desired behavior is for the Find/Replace feature to not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. This will allow for a more flexible and accurate search, while respecting the case of the user input.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document. 2. Select Edit > Find/Replace... 3. In the Find field, type 'a' and click 'Find'. 4. Try to type 'A' in the Find field. The typed entry is replaced with the value from the history, preventing the desired search."}
