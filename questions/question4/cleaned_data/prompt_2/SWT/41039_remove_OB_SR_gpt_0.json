To reproduce the bug, follow these steps: 1) Open the Find/Replace dialog (Edit -> Find/Replace). 2) Enter a search term into the text box. 3) Press the Return key. The bug report mentions that nothing happens when the Return key is pressed. However, pressing the Return key should trigger a 'Find' operation, just like clicking on the 'Find' button, which is highlighted as the default button in the Find/Replace dialog.", "OB": "", "EB": "The Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog should perform a Find operation on Mac OS X", "SR": "Investigate the issue and fix the bug so that hitting the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog triggers a Find operation on Mac OS X."}
