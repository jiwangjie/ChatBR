  "title": "Bug 45145: Second window comes to front when using first",
  "description": "When switching from another application to an Eclipse window and clicking on a docked view or perspective, the other window comes to the front over other applications' windows.",
  "OB": "Upon switching to an Eclipse window and interacting with a docked view or perspective, the second window unexpectedly comes to the front, obscuring other applications' windows.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that unless explicitly clicking on the Eclipse dock icon, a window should only come to the front if clicked on explicitly or if a specific behavior leads to a widget in the other window.",
  "SR": "1. Open Eclipse and have another application running in the background.\n2. Switch from the background application to the Eclipse window.\n3. Click on a docked view or perspective.\n4. Observe that the other Eclipse window comes to the front, covering windows from other applications."
