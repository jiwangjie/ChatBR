{"id": "41347", "title": "Bug 41347CCombo fires defaultSelection on mouse list selection", "description": "Bug 41347CCombo shouldn't fire defaultSelection on mouse list selection. It shouldn't do this. A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog dismissed just because the entry was selected.", "OB": "The CCombo fires defaultSelection on mouse list selection, which is incorrect behavior.", "EB": "It should fire a selection event instead. Default selection should only occur when the enter key is pressed in the text field of the CCombo. The typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog.", "SR": "When you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event. Standard Combos do not exhibit this behavior. As a result, it is not possible to differentiate between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo."}
