The FontMetrics API is also heavily used by the StyledText. I believe that the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and updated only when the font is changed.", "OB": "Running Eclipse, using the Java Editor: A single key stroke can cause the API Font.getFontData() to be called 13 times. This API is also overused when we are scrolling the StyledText and selecting text. Each Font has 7 FontData, therefore every time I type 'a' in the Java Editor, 91 (7 * 13) FontData will be loaded.", "EB": "I believe, and many people agree, that this API doesn't need to be used at all by the StyledText when it's being typed.", "SR": "The StyledText implementation should optimize the usage of Font.getFontData() to reduce unnecessary calls, particularly during typing and scrolling operations. Additionally, caching the metric information and updating it only when the font is changed would improve performance."}
