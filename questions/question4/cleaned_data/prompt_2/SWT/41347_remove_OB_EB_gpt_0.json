A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected.", "OB": "Currently, when you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when selecting an entry using the mouse in the combo list, the CCombo should not fire a defaultSelection event, similar to how standard Combos behave.", "SR": "As a result of the current behavior, it is not possible to differentiate between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo, as both actions trigger the defaultSelection event. This behavior should be fixed to ensure consistent user experience."}
