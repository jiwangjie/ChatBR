This behavior is unexpected and can lead to the dismissal of the dialog. Users of a combobox would be surprised by this behavior.", "OB": "If the user drops down the combo list using the mouse and then selects an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event. This behavior is not observed in standard Combos. Due to this issue, it is not possible to distinguish between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo.", "EB": "CCombo should not fire the defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse from the combo list. This will ensure consistent behavior with standard Combos. The distinction between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo should be clear.", "SR": "Please fix the CCombo to not fire the defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse from the combo list. Ensure that the behavior is consistent with standard Combos and provide a clear distinction between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo."}
