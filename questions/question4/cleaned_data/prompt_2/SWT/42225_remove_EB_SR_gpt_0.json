The keybinding manager seems to recognize it as Ctrl+Del and deletes the next word instead. When I try to reassign the key via the key preference page, it displays Ctrl+Del when I press Ctrl+Backspace. I am using a Swiss German keyboard with Swiss German locale.", "OB": "The keybinding manager is misinterpreting the Ctrl+Backspace key combination as Ctrl+Del and deleting the next word instead of allowing me to assign a command to it.", "EB": "I expect to be able to assign a command to the Ctrl+Backspace key combination without it being confused with Ctrl+Del.", "SR": "Fix the keybinding manager to correctly recognize and allow commands to be assigned to the Ctrl+Backspace key combination."}
