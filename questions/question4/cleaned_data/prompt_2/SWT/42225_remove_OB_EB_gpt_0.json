When I try to do so, the keybinding manager mistakenly recognizes it as Ctrl+Delete and deletes the next word instead. To illustrate this issue, when I try to reassign the key via the key preference page, it displays Ctrl+Delete when I press Ctrl+Backspace. I am using a Swiss German keyboard with the Swiss German locale.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
