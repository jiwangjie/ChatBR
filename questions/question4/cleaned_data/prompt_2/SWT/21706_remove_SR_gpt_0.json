This issue occurs because the CLDC class libraries do not define NoClassDefFoundError, causing a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. The issue can only be seen when verifying or using jxeLink or similar tools; the eclipse compiler and Sun's compiler do not raise a compiler error. The suggested solution is to remove the reflection by adding a private constructor to the BidiUtil class.", "OB": "The issue occurs because the CLDC class libraries do not define NoClassDefFoundError, causing a problem in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, a private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, it is appropriate to prevent people from instantiating the class unnecessarily. Adding a private constructor does not increase the class size, as the compiler provides a free public constructor by default.", "SR": "Add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class to prevent instantiation and remove the reflection usage."}
