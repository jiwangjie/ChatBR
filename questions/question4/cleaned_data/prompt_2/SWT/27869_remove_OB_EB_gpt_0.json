{"id": "27869", "title": "StyledText overuses Font.getFontData method", "description": "When using StyledText in Redhat 8, the Font.getFontData method is being overused. This method is used to obtain font information such as metrics. However, calling this method frequently can impact performance. The FontMetrics API is also heavily used by StyledText. I believe that the metric information should be cached in StyledText and only updated when the font is changed.", "OB": "The Font.getFontData method is called excessively in the StyledText component, leading to potential performance issues.", "EB": "The metric information in StyledText should be cached and only updated when the font is changed, reducing the reliance on frequent calls to Font.getFontData.", "SR": "To investigate the performance issue, add a system.out.println statement at the beginning of the Font.getFontData method. Run a self-hosted Eclipse and observe the console output. It is important to verify if the performance is significantly affected on platforms such as Motif running on UTF8, compared to Windows."}
