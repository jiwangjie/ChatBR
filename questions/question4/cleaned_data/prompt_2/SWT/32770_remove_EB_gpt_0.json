{"id": "32770", "title": "Java application launch shortcut error doesn't offer helpful information to the user", "description": "When trying to launch a Java application using the shortcut, the error message displayed does not provide useful information to the user. This issue needs to be addressed to improve the quality of the error message.", "OB": "When attempting to launch a Java application using the shortcut, a dialog appears with the message 'Launch failed: no main type found'. It would be beneficial to track resource selection in a similar way as external tools do for variable expansion. Additionally, the two mechanisms could potentially be combined into a single mechanism.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a Java file that contains a main method. 2. Select a view that is not based on resources (e.g. the Debug view). 3. Click on 'Debug As' -> 'Java Application'."}
