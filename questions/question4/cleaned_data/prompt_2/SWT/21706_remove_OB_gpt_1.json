  "title": "Bug 21706: BidiUtil in Win32 Contains Class.forName() Usage",
  "description": "The current issue pertains to the usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class for win32.",
  "OB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 uses Class.forName() which could potentially allow unnecessary instantiation of the class.",
  "EB": "To address this, a private constructor should be added. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, having a private constructor would prevent unnecessary instantiation. This change won't increase the size, as the compiler already provides a free public constructor. It simply converts the constructor from public to private.",
  "SR": "To resolve the issue, modify the line: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), 'windowProc', 4); Although untested, the modification should retain the functionality."
