  "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 Class.forName() Usage",
  "description": "The BidiUtil in win32 contains Class.forName() usage.",
  "OB": "The BidiUtil class allows public instantiation despite having no non-static methods. This could potentially lead to unnecessary instantiation.",
  "EB": "To mitigate unnecessary instantiation, a private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class. As there are no non-static methods, making the constructor private would prevent unintended instantiation.",
  "SR": "1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 module.\n2. Observe the absence of non-static methods.\n3. Implement a private constructor in the class to prevent unnecessary instantiation.\n4. Verify that this change does not add any additional size and functions as expected."
