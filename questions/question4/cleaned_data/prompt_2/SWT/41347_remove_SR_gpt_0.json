{"id": "41347", "title": "Bug 41347CCombo firing defaultSelection on mouse list selection", "description": "Bug 41347CCombo fires defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse, which is not expected behavior. This can be confusing for users, as they may not want the dialog to be dismissed just because an entry was selected. Standard Combos do not have this issue. The problem is that there is no way to differentiate between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo.", "OB": "When you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event. This behavior is not consistent with standard Combos. As a result, it is difficult to distinguish between a mouse selection and hitting enter from the text field.", "EB": "Instead of firing a defaultSelection event, the CCombo should fire a selection event when an entry is selected using the mouse. The default selection should only occur when the enter key is pressed in the text field of the CCombo.", "SR": "The CCombo should be modified to only fire defaultSelection when the enter key is pressed in the text field. Mouse selections should trigger a selection event."}
