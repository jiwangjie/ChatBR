{"id": "41347", "title": "CCombo firing defaultSelection on mouse list selection", "description": "The issue is that the CCombo widget fires a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the drop-down list using the mouse. This behavior is unexpected and can be confusing for users. Normally, selecting an entry from a combo box using the mouse should not dismiss any dialog or take any immediate action.", "OB": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Drop down the combo list using the mouse.\n2. Select an entry from the list using the mouse.\n3. Notice that the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event, which is not the expected behavior for a standard Combo widget.", "EB": "The CCombo widget should not fire a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the drop-down list using the mouse. This behavior should be consistent with standard Combo widgets.", "SR": "The CCombo widget behavior should be modified to only fire a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the keyboard or the Enter key from the text field of the CCombo. Mouse selections from the drop-down list should not trigger this event. The purpose of this change is to improve the usability and consistency of the CCombo widget with other combo box implementations."}
