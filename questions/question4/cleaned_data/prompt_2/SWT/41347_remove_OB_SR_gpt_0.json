A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected.", "OB": "The CCombo currently fires defaultSelection event when an entry is selected with the mouse from the dropdown list.", "EB": "It should fire a selection event instead. Default selection means something was selected and you should go and do something. The typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog. A CCombo should not fire default selection event when an entry is selected from the dropdown list using the mouse. Pressing enter from the text field should be treated as default selection.", "SR": "Update the CCombo to fire a selection event instead of defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the dropdown list using the mouse."}
