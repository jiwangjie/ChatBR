This behavior occurs regardless of whether the other window was clicked on intentionally or if a widget in the other window was interacted with.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the only time a window should come to the front is if it is clicked on explicitly by the user, or if some behavior within the application requires focus to be shifted to a widget in the other window.", "SR": ""}
