{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil usage of Class.forName() causes NoClassDefFoundError in CLDC version", "description": "The problem with BidiUtil in the win32 version of SWT is that it uses the Class.forName() method which throws a NoClassDefFoundError. This error is not defined in the CLDC class libraries, causing a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. The issue can only be seen when using jxeLink or a similar tool, as the compiler generates the call and assumes that NoClassDefFoundError is available. To resolve this issue, the reflection usage should be removed.", "OB": "The problem with BidiUtil in the win32 version of SWT is that it uses the Class.forName() method which throws a NoClassDefFoundError.
