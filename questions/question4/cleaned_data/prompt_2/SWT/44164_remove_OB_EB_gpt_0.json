"description": "Bug 44164 - update needed in javadoc for constructor Image(Device , ImageData)\n\nIn the provided code snippet, when attempting to create an instance of the Image class using the constructor Image(Device , ImageData), an exception is thrown. It is important to note that the ImageData is successfully created and the exception is specifically related to the creation of the Image instance.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Import the org.eclipse.swt.widgets package.\n2. Create a class named TestImageInvalidImage containing a main method.\n3. Inside the main method, create an instance of ImageData with appropriate parameters.\n4. Attempt to create an instance of Image using the constructor Image(Device , ImageData).\n5. Observe that an exception is thrown.",
"OB": "The documentation of the constructor Image(Device , ImageData) is missing information about the exception that can be thrown when creating an Image object.",
"EB": "The javadoc for the constructor Image(Device , ImageData) should mention that a 'SWTException' is thrown if the provided ImageData is invalid or if there is not enough memory to create the Image object.",
"SR": "Update the javadoc for the constructor Image(Device , ImageData) to include information about the possible exception(s) that can occur during the creation of the Image object."}
