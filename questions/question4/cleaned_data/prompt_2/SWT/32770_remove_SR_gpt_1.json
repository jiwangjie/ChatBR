  "title": "Java Application Launch Shortcut Error Lacks User Guidance",
  "description": "The current error message upon Java application launch failure lacks clarity and fails to guide users in troubleshooting. There's a need to enhance the error messaging to provide actionable guidance.",
  "OB": "When attempting to launch a Java application, a dialog displays the message: 'Launch failed: no main type found.' It appears that the system should track resource selection similar to how external tools handle variable expansion. Combining these mechanisms into a unified process could be beneficial.",
  "EB": "To assist users in resolving this issue, the error message should provide actionable guidance. For instance, the message could be improved to read: 'Launch failed: No file with a main type selected.' This alteration directs users to select a resource, aiding in resolving the problem.",
  "SR": "1. Launch the Java application.\n2. Observe the 'Launch failed: no main type found' error message.\n3. Check if the message provides guidance on selecting a file with a main type. If not, the expected behavior is to see the revised message providing clear instructions."
