I don't believe we even need to redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection.", "OB": "The selection background is not rendered correctly on bidi platforms.", "EB": "The method drawLineSelectionBackground should only be used to render the special line break selection.", "SR": "build 20030903. The attached BidiUtil exposes a bug in the selection rendering code in DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground. To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps: 1. Use the attached BidiUtil to type one English character followed by three or more Arabic/Hebrew characters. 2. Place the caret at the beginning of the line. 3. Select the next two characters, including one bidi character. The selection background includes unselected characters."}
