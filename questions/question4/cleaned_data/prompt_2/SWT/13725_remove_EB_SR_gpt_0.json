{"id": "13725", "title": "Bug 13725 - Revert is slower than Close and Reopen in Java editor", "description": "When working in the Java editor, I observed that the 'Revert' operation is significantly slower than the 'Close' and 'Reopen' operations. In my workflow, I answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog and then double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. When I repeat these steps and select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "OB": "Perform the following steps to reproduce the issue:  1.
