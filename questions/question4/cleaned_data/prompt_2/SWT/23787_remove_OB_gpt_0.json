It seems that their values can be selected and copied by the user.", "EB": "The fields on the Info page should be implemented as Labels instead of readonly Text fields. This will improve the visual appearance of the page on all motif platforms.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select a Project, right click and go to Properties.
