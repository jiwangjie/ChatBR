{"id": "24877", "title": "Cannot get file extension from SWT FileDialog", "description": "When using SWT FileDialog, there is no way to retrieve the file extension that the user selected. This makes the dialog almost unusable since it prevents us from determining the correct file extension to append to the file name. This problem can be illustrated when exporting to a JAR file. We need an API for the FileDialog that returns the 'Save as type' field selected by the user.", "OB": "It is currently not possible to retrieve the file extension selected by the user from the FileDialog. To resolve this issue, an API should be added to the FileDialog class that returns the value of the 'Save as type' field selected by the user.", "EB": "When performing the following steps in the export wizard:\n1) Select a Java file\n2) Select 'File' > 'Export'\n3) Select JAR file and click 'Next'\n4) Click 'Browse...' to open the Save As file dialog\n5) Enter 'test' for the file name\n6) Select '.zip' for the 'Save as type' field\n7) Click 'Save'\n\nThe JAR export wizard should use the file name 'test.zip' for the JAR file field, but it currently uses only 'test'.", "SR": "The JAR export wizard should use the file extension selected by the user in the Save As file dialog. This can be achieved by modifying the code to append the selected file extension to the file name in the JAR file field."}
