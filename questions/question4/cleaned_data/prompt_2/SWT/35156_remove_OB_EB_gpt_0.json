Launch eclipse with DBCS locale.\n2. From the menu bar, select Search -> Help.\n3. When the Help search window appears, click on the first text field and press Ctrl+F1.\n\nThe expected behavior is that a help pop-up screen should appear, displaying information about the Help search. The actual behavior is that nothing happens. This issue occurs with all DBCS languages. The problem is specifically isolated to the first text field in the Help search window, as the Ctrl+F1 shortcut functions properly when cycling through the other fields using the tab key."}
