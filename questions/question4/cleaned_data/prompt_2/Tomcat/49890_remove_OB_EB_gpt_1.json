  "title": "Nio Selector Issue Causing CPU Spike on Linux Platform",
  "description": "The server experiences a consistent 100% CPU utilization on the Linux platform. This behavior persists until a server restart is performed. This issue has been encountered across multiple Java versions: 1.6.007, 1.6.018, 1.6.021. A similar problem was identified as Bug 46373, which was reportedly resolved by the Jetty team (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel). To investigate, logging was added to NioEndpoint.java.",
  "OB": "Server CPU utilization reaches 100% and remains at that level continuously until a server restart is initiated.",
  "EB": "The server should not experience continuous 100% CPU utilization on the Linux platform.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run the attached 'NioEndpoint.7z' containing the patched NioEndpoint.java file (with logging).\n2. Deploy the 'web.7z' file, which includes a simple web application.\n3. Observe the server's CPU utilization on a Linux platform."
