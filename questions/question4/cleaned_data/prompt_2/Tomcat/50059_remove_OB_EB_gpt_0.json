Make a Servlet 3.0 web app called 'foo' with the metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEB-INF/web.xml.", "OB": "Resources should be served from /WEB-INF/lib/{.jar}/META-INF/resources when metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in web.xml.", "EB": "Resources are not being served from /WEB-INF/lib/{.jar}/META-INF/resources when metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in web.xml.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a jar file containing a single /META-INF/resources/index.html file.\n2. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2.\n3. In a browser, go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\nExpected result: A 200 response and the index.html file should be served.\nActual result: A 404 response.\nIf you modify the web.xml file to set metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the app, accessing /foo/index.html will work as expected.\nNote: The issue does not occur when using Glassfish v3.0.1."}
