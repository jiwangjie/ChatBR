To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Create a Servlet 3.0 web application (let's call it \"foo\") with the metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBINF/web.xml file.\n\n2. Place the jar file (let's call it \"bar.jar\") in the /WEBINF/lib directory.\n\n3. Make a jar file that contains a single /METAINF/resources/index.html file.\n\n4. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and in the browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\n\nExpected result: The server should respond with a 200 status code and serve the index.html file.\n\nActual result: The server responds with 404 status code and the index.html file is not served.\n\nIf you modify the web.xml file to set metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the app, the /foo/index.html will respond as expected. Note that when the same web app is tested with Glassfish v3.0.1, it works as expected regardless of the metadatacomplete attribute setting.\n\nUpon inspecting the servlet 3.0 specification, it appears that the metadatacomplete attribute only regulates annotation and web fragment processing.", "OB": "The Servlet 3.0 web app (foo) has metadatacomplete=\"true\" set in the /WEBINF/web.xml file.", "EB": "The jar file (bar.jar) needs to be placed in the /WEBINF/lib directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1.
