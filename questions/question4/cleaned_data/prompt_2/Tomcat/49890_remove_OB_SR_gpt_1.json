  "title": "Bug 49890: Nio Selector issue on Linux platform",
  "description": "When using NioSelector on Linux, the server's CPU reaches 100% and remains at that level until the server is restarted. This behavior has been observed while running Java versions 1.6.007, 1.6.018, and 1.6.021. It appears to be a duplicate of issue Bug 46373, which was addressed by the Jetty team (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel). Logging has been added to NioEndpoint.java for further investigation.",
  "OB": "The server's CPU usage spikes to 100% and remains at that level constantly until the server is restarted.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the server should not sustain 100% CPU usage indefinitely. To reproduce this JVM bug, perform several requests (e.g., pressing F5 in the browser and holding the button) on the web application.",
  "SR": "1. Launch the web application.\n2. Continuously press the F5 key in the browser or hold the refresh button to send multiple requests to the server.\n3. Observe the CPU usage of the server, noting any spikes or sustained high usage."
