Created attachment 26089 to improve the division of responsibility for the isUserInRole and login/logout methods.\n\nThere are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility.\n\n1. The Request.isUserInRole method tries to prevent JACC (Java Authorization Contract for Containers) implementations and is also incorrect in the current Tomcat implementation. In the current implementation, role reference mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. However, JACC requires that this be implemented by constructing a role reference permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\nOB: \n\nEB: \n\nSR: Aside from the specification language, let's consider a web app with two roles - A and B, and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A."}
