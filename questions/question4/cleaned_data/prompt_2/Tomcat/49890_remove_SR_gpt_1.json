It appears that the problem was fixed by the Jetty team: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel. Additional logging has been added to NioEndpoint.java.",

  "EB": "To reproduce this JVM bug, multiple requests need to be made to the web application (simply pressing F5 in the browser and holding the button should suffice).",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce: \n1. Access the web application.\n2. Press and hold the F5 key in the browser for several requests.\n3. Observe the server's CPU usage and note any instances where it reaches 100%."
