  "title": "Bug 50016: Bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods",
  "description": "There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility.\n1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.",
  "OB": "If the user is not in the mapped role, the original role is tested. However, the implementation of the new login and logout methods is excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. Specifically, checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/pw login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed. ",
  "EB": "",
  "SR": "Aside from the spec language, consider a web app with two roles A and B and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A."
