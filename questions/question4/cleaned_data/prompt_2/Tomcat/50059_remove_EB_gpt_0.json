Make a Servlet 3.0 web app (let's name it foo) with metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBIBNF/web.xml.\n\nOB: Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and in the browser go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\nExpected result: 200 response and index.html served.\n\nEB: Actual result: 404 error is returned. The index.html file is not served.\n\nSR: Modify the web.xml to have metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the app. Then go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html. The expected result is a 200 response and index.html should be served.\n\nAdditional information: When the webapp's metadatacomplete attribute is set to true, the resources in the /METAINF/ directory of the .jar file located in /WEBINF/lib/ are not served. This behavior is different from Glassfish v3.0.1, where the resources are served regardless of the metadatacomplete attribute setting.", "OB": "Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and in the browser go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.
