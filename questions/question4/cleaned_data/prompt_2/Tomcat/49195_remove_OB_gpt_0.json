{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message displayed when using shutdown port 1 with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, there is an error message that gets printed when stopping Tomcat using the shutdown port. This behavior may also be observed with jsvc. However, I have not tested it.", "OB": "It would be beneficial to improve the way Tomcat is stopped. Instead of using System.exit(0), it should be possible to use wait(10000) in StandardServer.await() and wake it up with a notifyAll() call or use interrupt() to wake a known thread.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Try to shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
