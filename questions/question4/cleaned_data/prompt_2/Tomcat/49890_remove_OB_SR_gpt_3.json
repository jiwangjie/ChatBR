  "description": "The server's CPU consistently reaches and maintains 100% usage until a restart occurs. This behavior has been observed on multiple Java versions: 1.6.007, 1.6.018, 1.6.021. There's a mention of a potentially related issue, Bug 46373, which seems to have been addressed by the Jetty team (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel). Additional logging has been added to NioEndpoint.java to investigate further.",
  "OB": "The server's CPU usage spikes to 100% and remains at that level continuously until a server restart is performed.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the server's CPU usage should not consistently reach 100% and remain at that level indefinitely. It should handle requests without causing prolonged 100% CPU usage.",
  "SR": "1. Run the web application using NioEndpoint.java on a Linux platform.\n2. Perform multiple requests to the application by pressing F5 in the browser and keeping the button pressed.\n3. Observe the server's CPU usage reaching and staying at 100% until the server is restarted."
