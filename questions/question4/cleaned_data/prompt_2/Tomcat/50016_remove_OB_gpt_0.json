Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent JACC implementations and is also wrong. In the current Tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role, and then the target role is tested. However, JACC requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\nOB: None\n\nEB: To be reasonably amenable to a JACC implementation, Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and, if possible, the servlet name to the wrapper. Additionally, if there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. Currently, the implementation reports true for both the original role and the mapped role.\n\n2. Both isUserInRole and the login/logout methods should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The Authenticator should also have the ability to decide whether it wants to cache the authentication results.\n\nSR: Aside from the spec language, consider a web app with two roles, A and B, and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A."}
