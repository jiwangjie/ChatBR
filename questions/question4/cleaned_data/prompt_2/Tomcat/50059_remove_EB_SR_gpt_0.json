Start the web application in Tomcat 7.0.2.\n2. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\n\nExpected result: \nReceive a 200 response and index.html should be served.\n\nActual result: \nReceive a 404 error.\n\nIf you modify the web.xml file to set metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the application, now accessing /foo/index.html will respond as expected.\n\nI also tested the same web application with Glassfish v3.0.1, and it works as expected regardless of the value set in the metadatacomplete attribute.\n\nUpon reviewing the Servlet 3.0 specification, it appears that the metadatacomplete attribute only regulates annotation and web fragment processing. In this case, even though the 'bar.jar' file has no annotations and is not a web fragment, it is still handled differently depending on the value of the metadatacomplete attribute.", "OB": "Start the web application in Tomcat 7.0.2 and access http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.
