{"id": "50793", "title": "Bug 50793: Invalid DispatchType in ServletRequestListener on async dispatch", "description": "When a ServletRequestListener is defined, the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST instead of ASYNC when it is invoked after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch(). The bug occurs in the following scenario: When the actual servlet is invoked, the type is correctly set to ASYNC. If the listener is intended to be invoked for each dispatch, then the DispatcherType should match the value returned in the filter/servlet.", "OB": "The DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST instead of ASYNC.", "EB": "The DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest should be ASYNC when invoked after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch().", "SR": "Ensure that the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is correctly set to ASYNC when a ServletRequestListener is invoked after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch()."}
