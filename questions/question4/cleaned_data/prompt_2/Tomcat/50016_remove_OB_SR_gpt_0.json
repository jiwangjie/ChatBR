Request.isUserInRole method tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. However, jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\n2. Both the login and logout methods should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. Additionally, the Authenticator should have the ability to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results.", "OB": "", "EB": "To be reasonably amenable to a jacc implementation, the Request.isUserInRole method should supply the original role and, if possible, the servlet name to the wrapper. Additionally, if there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. Currently, the method reports true for both A and B roles, which is incorrect.\n\nBoth the login and logout methods should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The Authenticator should also have the ability to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results.", "SR": ""}
