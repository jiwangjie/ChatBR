{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log. The message is: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite the error message, Tomcat does stop after printing this message. This can be observed because Catalina.stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "If this is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call. Alternatively, it could use the interrupt() call to wake it up if we know the thread.", "SR": ""}
