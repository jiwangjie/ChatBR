{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 - Incorrect behavior when custom cookie name is used for URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299 - In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter when the session ID is encoded in the URL, given that URL rewriting is enabled. However, the actual result is that the page sends a cookie with the name MYSESSIONCOOKIE, but the reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "OB": "Created attachment 25442 [details]cookiename.war - The attachment contains a WAR file that demonstrates the issue. ", "EB": "Expected result: If the statement in 7.1.1 is followed, I would expect the Reload link to be http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": "The servlet specification should be updated to ensure that the custom cookie name is used as the name of the URI parameter for session ID when URL rewriting is enabled."}
