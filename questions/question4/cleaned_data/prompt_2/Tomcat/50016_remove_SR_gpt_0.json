Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong.\n\nIn the current Tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. JACC requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\nOB: If the user is not in the mapped role, the original role is tested. However,\n(a). The implementation of the new login and logout methods is excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. In particular, checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/password login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed.\n\nEB: So, to be reasonably amenable to a JACC implementation, Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and, if possible, the servlet name to the wrapper. (b) If there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. A user that logs in and is in role A and not B should be able to test if he/she is in A (false) and if he/she is in B (true). The current implementation reports true for both A and B.\n\n2. Both should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The authenticator also ought to be able to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results.", "OB": "The implementation of the new login and logout methods is too intrusive into the authentication internals.
