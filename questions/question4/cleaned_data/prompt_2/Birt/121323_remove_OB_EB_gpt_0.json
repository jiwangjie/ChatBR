{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to potential issues.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part in the XML Edit Data Set dialog and leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. The RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign without the filter information.", "EB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part in the XML Edit Data Set dialog and leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be preserved. The RelationInformation and the filter information should be persisted correctly to .rptdesign.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left'], for the column mapping. 3. Verify that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. 4. Leave the dialog and check if the filter information is retained when inspecting the persisted .rptdesign file."}
