Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. Do you want to save the changes?\n\n<Yes> would save the changes\n<No> would discard the changes\n<Cancel> would do nothing and remain on the Source page.\n\nAdditionally, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very informative. The error message is 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more conventional approach would be to display the message: 'XML Report Design has been changed'. The dialog needs to use a better title (and certainly should not have the quotes).", "SR": ""}
