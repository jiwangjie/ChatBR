If an invalid value is entered, the system should display an error message and prevent the value from being stored in the report design.", "SR": "1. Open the report design creation page.\n2. Go to the section where date/time values can be added.\n3. Enter an invalid date/time string, such as a random combination of letters and numbers.\n4. Submit the form or try to save the report design.\n5. Verify that the system rejects the invalid date/time value and displays an error message."}
