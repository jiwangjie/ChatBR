{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "The bug is related to the behavior of the 'getcolumnlabel' function in the meta data object. Currently, when this function is called before data extraction, it returns null labels. However, after extraction, it returns recognizable strings. This discrepancy in behavior is causing issues when trying to display the labels to the end user. The expected behavior is that 'getcolumnlabel' should return the same recognizable strings both before and after extraction.", "OB": "When calling 'getcolumnlabel' before extraction, null labels are returned. After extraction, recognizable strings are returned.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that 'getcolumnlabel' should return the same recognizable strings both before and after extraction. This is necessary since the labels need to be displayed to the end user before extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Call the 'getcolumnlabel' function on the meta data object before data extraction.\n2. Note the null labels that are returned.\n3. Perform data extraction.\n4. Call the 'getcolumnlabel' function on the meta data object again.\n5. Verify that recognizable strings are now returned as labels."}
