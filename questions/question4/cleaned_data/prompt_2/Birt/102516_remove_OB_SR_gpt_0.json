The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, the tree control loads all the tables and columns at once, which can cause performance issues if the data source contains a large number of objects. \n\nOB: Currently, the tree control loads all tables and columns at once when the page is opened, regardless of whether the user intends to view or interact with them.\n\nEB: The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This way, only the relevant tables and columns will be loaded, improving performance and user experience.\n\nSR: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that all tables and columns in the data source are loaded at once.\n3. Try expanding the tree or applying a filter to see if the loading is deferred until necessary."}
