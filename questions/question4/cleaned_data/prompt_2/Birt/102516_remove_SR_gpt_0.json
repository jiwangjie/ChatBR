The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. Currently, even with the schema filter applied, there is a warning message displayed during the page load because the tree is being populated at that time.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being loaded on the page. Even with the applied schema filter, a warning message is displayed during the page load.", "EB": "The load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will prevent the warning message from being displayed during the page load.", "SR": ""}
