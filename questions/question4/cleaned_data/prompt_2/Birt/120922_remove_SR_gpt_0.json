Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. When prompted with 'Do you want to save the changes?' options are: 'Yes' to save the changes, 'No' to discard the changes, and 'Cancel' to remain on the Source page. The dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The user is left to figure out what action to take to save or discard the changes, which can be challenging. The error message is not clear and only states 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "A better and more user-friendly approach would be to display a message indicating that the XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog should use a more appropriate title without the quotes.", "SR": ""}
