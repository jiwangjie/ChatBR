The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.    The problem is that on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Currently, even with the schema filter implemented, there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page is populated with every schema (aka catalog) on the system, causing a delay in loading and a warning message on load.", "EB": "The loading of the tree control should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter to improve performance and prevent unnecessary warning messages on load.", "SR": ""}
