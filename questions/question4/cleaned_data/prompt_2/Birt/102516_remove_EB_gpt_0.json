{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 has a schema filter, but there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a while to load. Eventually, a warning message is displayed saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should improve performance by loading tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema on load. This will prevent the warning message from being displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers. Notice that the entire schema is queried and it takes a while to load. Eventually, a warning message is displayed saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Refer to Bug 101372 for the request to add the ability to filter based on schema."}
