{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like `section[@id='left']`, the selection is stripped and stored in the `filterInfo` HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the `RelationInformation` gets persisted to `.rptdesign`, but the data stored in the `filterInfo` is lost. This can cause trouble when treating XPath expressions in this way.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information after leaving the dialog. The data stored in the `filterInfo` HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information after leaving the dialog. The data stored in the `filterInfo` HashMap should be retained.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, such as `section[@id='left']`, in the column mapping.\n3. Note that the selection is stored in the `filterInfo` HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog again.\n6. Verify that the filter information, including the data stored in the `filterInfo` HashMap, is still present."}
