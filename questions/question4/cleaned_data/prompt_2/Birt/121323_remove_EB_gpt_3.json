{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When an XPath expression with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'], is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues.", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is not persisted.", "EB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be persisted.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'].\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n5. Verify that the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is still present."}
