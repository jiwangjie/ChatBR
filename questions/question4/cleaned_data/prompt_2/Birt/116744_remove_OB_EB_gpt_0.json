Instead, all types of content are displayed as plain text without any formatting or interpretation of HTML or RTF tags.", "EB": "The dynamic text element should correctly render the different types of content based on their content type. HTML text within <html> tags should be rendered as formatted HTML, HTML fragments not within <html> tags should be rendered as plain text, and text with RTF tags should be rendered with appropriate formatting based on the RTF tags.", "SR": "1. Create a database field with three types of content: HTML text within <html> tags, HTML fragments not within <html> tags, and text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field.\n3. Observe that the dynamic text element renders all types of content as plain text without any formatting or interpretation of HTML or RTF tags."}
