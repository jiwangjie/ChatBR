{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922 - 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs to be improved", "description": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed requesting the user to save their changes. The problem is that the user is not provided clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes. Additionally, the error message displayed is not very informative as it is titled 'Error'. The error message text is 'Source page is dirty.' To resolve this issue, the following improvements are suggested:\n- Provide a better and more descriptive title for the dialog (without quotes).\n- Clearly indicate that the XML Report Design has been modified and prompt the user to save or discard the changes.\n- Make it easier for the user to understand how to save or discard the changes.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, the error message 'Source page is dirty.' is displayed, and the user is left uncertain about how to save or discard the changes.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog with a more descriptive title and clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes when the XML Report Design has been modified.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Switch to the 'source' view of the Layout Editor.\n3. Modify the XML content.\n4. Try to switch back to the Layout view.\n5. Observe the error message and note the lack of clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes."}
