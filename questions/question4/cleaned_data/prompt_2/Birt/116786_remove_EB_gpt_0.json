{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When including a library in the report design, the current behavior is that an absolute path is being stored. For example, in the property tag, the fileName attribute contains an absolute path (e.g., 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary').", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the BIRT designer to generate and store a relative path instead of an absolute path. For example, the fileName attribute should contain a relative path (e.g., '../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary') instead of an absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design in the '$project/test' folder.\n3. Include a library from the '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' folder.\n4. Check the property tag of the library in the report design and observe that it stores a relative path instead of an absolute path."}
