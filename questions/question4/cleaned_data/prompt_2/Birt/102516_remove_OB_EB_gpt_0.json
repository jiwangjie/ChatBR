Currently, when the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried, and eventually get the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.\n\nBug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/showbug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, causing a delay. Eventually, a message is displayed indicating that only 500 items can be viewed in the available list.", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, the tables and columns should load on demand, eliminating the need to query the entire schema upfront. The message indicating the limit of 500 items should not be shown.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the entire schema is queried upon opening the editor.\n\nTo verify the expected behavior:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Tables and columns should load on demand without querying the entire schema.\n3. The message indicating the limit of 500 items should not be displayed."}
