{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly when the column width is smaller than the width of the largest item in the list. As a result, the drop down button may be clipped and not visible to the user without expanding the property sheet view. This issue needs to be investigated to determine if it is specific to our implementation or an issue with SWT.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should always be the width of the column it is placed in. If any of the items in the combo box list is wider than the column, the combo box should adjust its width to accommodate the widest item, while ensuring that the drop down button remains within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "The PropertySheetViewer allows editing objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs displayed in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the createCellEditor() method of IPropertyDescriptor to create editors for the property sheet. In this case, I create a ComboBoxCellEditor with a list of strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the drop down button should be visible at the right edge of the column. However, if any string in the list is wider than the column, the combo box expands to accommodate the widest item, causing the drop down button to be clipped. To ensure a good user experience, the combo box should resize to fit the column while keeping the drop down button visible."}
