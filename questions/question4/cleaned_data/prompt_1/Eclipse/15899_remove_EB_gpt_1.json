  "description": "",
  "OB": "Using build 20020508 with the latest UI code, when attempting to close all saved files, the 'Close All Saved' option from the file menu does not consistently work. Specifically, after creating a new file (f1.txt) and closing all editors, nothing happens.",
  "EB": "After selecting 'Close All Saved' from the file menu, the expected behavior is that all saved files, including the newly created f1.txt, should be closed successfully.",
  "SR": "1. Using build 20020508, open the application and ensure the latest UI code is applied.\n2. Open multiple editors.\n3. Create a new file named f1.txt.\n4. Select 'Close All Saved' from the file menu.\n5. Observe if all saved files, including f1.txt, are closed as expected."
