However, the action could have written to the status line. We currently do not have the API necessary to get the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. The problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "The keybinding service in Emacs always clears the status line, even when an action writes to it.", "EB": "The keybinding service in Emacs should not clear the status line when an action writes to it.", "SR": "Build 20020611: When running with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. To fix this, modify the AcceleratorScope.resetMode function so that it does not clear the status line."}
