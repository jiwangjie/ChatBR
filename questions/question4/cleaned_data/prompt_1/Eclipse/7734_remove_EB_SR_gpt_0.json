{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without save file warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nResults:\nThere is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s); the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.\n\nExpected behavior:\nWhen the user attempts to shut down or reboot the computer while a WSWB session is active with unsaved changes in a text file, a warning or question message box should pop up, allowing the user to save their progress before proceeding with the shutdown/reboot process. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) provide such warnings, and WSWB should do the same to prevent loss of work."}
