{"id": "19933", "title": "Emacs: keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When running Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, the action could have written to the status line. We currently do not have the API necessary to get the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. The problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When in the default mode, the status line should not be cleared when running actions that write to it.", "EB": "Currently, the status line is always cleared when running actions in Emacs keybindings mode, even when the action writes to the status line. This behavior should be changed so that the status line is not cleared when running actions in the default mode.", "SR": "To address this issue, modify the keybinding service to prevent the status line from being cleared when running actions in the default mode in Emacs keybindings."}
