{"id": "19933", "title": "Emacs: keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When running in with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the statusline will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, the action could have written to the status line. We currently do not have the API necessary to get the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. The problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When running in with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line is expected to display the message in the status line. However, the current implementation clears the status line when using AcceleratorScope.resetMode, causing the message to be removed.", "EB": "When running in with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line should continue to display the message as intended. The status line should not be cleared when using AcceleratorScope.resetMode.", "SR": "Modify the AcceleratorScope.resetMode function to keep the status line message intact when running in the default mode with Emacs keybindings."}
