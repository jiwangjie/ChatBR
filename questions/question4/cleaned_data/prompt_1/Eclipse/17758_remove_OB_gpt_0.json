{"id": "17758", "title": "Bug 17758 - Problems with 'Go Into' action in Navigator View", "description": "There are multiple problems with the 'Go Into' action in the Navigator View. When closing a project, the history is not cleaned up and no indication is given in the Navigator View that the project is closed. Additionally, even with some history, opening another project and selecting a folder still enables the 'Go Into' action. Another issue is that after performing multiple 'Go Back' actions, the 'Go Forward' action is still enabled but leads to a blank screen on the first forward click. Clicking forward then back resolves the issue.", "OB": "When a project is closed, the history should be cleaned up, and a text indicating that the project is closed should appear in the Navigator View.", "EB": "When a project is closed, the history should be cleaned up, and a text indicating that the project is closed should appear in the Navigator View.

Perform a clean F1 build. 2. Import all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects. 3. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant). 4. Perform 'Go Into', 'Go Up', 'Go Back', 'Go Back' actions, which should work fine. 5. Close the project. At this point, the 'Forward' action is still enabled, but clicking it leads to a blank screen. 6. Click 'Forward' and then 'Back' to resolve the issue."}
