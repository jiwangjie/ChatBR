{"id": "19933", "title": "Bug 19933: Emacs keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When running Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, the action could have written to the status line. Currently, we do not have the necessary API to retrieve the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. However, the problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When a mode is entered, the key sequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "It would be beneficial to have an API that allows retrieving the message from the status line, which would enable us to solve the problem more effectively in general.", "SR": "Find a way to preserve the status line message when running with Emacs keybindings, without compromising compatibility with other modes."}
