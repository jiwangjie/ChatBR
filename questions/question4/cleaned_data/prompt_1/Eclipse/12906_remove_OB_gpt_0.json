The warning message should inform the user that they may overwrite any unsaved changes and ask if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message could be displayed, indicating that the file cannot be opened in another editor until it is closed in the current editor. This behavior is expected to be a safety feature that prevents external editing while the file is already opened in the editor."}
