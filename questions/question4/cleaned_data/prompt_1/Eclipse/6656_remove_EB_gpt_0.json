When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "OB": "The close button moves down when the view is resized smaller on linux, running build 20011127.
