    "description": "Bug 24779[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed. When a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of Eclipse, until the perspective is displayed one time and the plugin is removed. However, even after removing the plugin, the same error message continues to appear when restarting Eclipse. This raises the question of why the workbench is still trying to create this view again.",
    "OB": "The issue occurs when a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view, causing an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message to be displayed after each launch of Eclipse. This error message persists even after the plugin corresponding to the invalid view has been removed and raises the question of why the workbench tries to create this view again.",
    "EB": "After opening Eclipse, open a view that belongs to a plugin that can be easily added and removed, such as the EditorList plugin. Then, open another perspective (such as the 'Java' perspective) to have two opened perspectives. Close Eclipse. At this point, remove or move the plugin used in the previously opened view. Now, switch back to the perspective that contains the view which no longer exists. The same 'Unable to restore perspective' error message will be displayed. Close and restart Eclipse again to observe that no more error messages are shown.",
    "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open Eclipse. 2. Open a view that belongs to a plugin that can be easily added and removed (e.g., EditorList plugin). 3. Open another perspective (e.g., 'Java' perspective) to have two opened perspectives. 4. Close Eclipse. 5. Remove or move the plugin used in the previously opened view. 6. Switch back to the perspective that contains the view which no longer exists. 7. Observe the same 'Unable to restore perspective' error message. 8. Close and restart Eclipse to confirm that no more error messages are shown."
