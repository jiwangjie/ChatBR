The text displayed in the dialog appears in red color, which is incorrect.", "OB": "Currently, when unchecking the 'Use Default Location' checkbox, the text in the edit box below gets cleared. This behavior is incorrect. The text should remain in the edit box, and it should be displayed in black color. Additionally, a standard on-the-fly validation small error icon should be included.", "EB": "When unchecking the 'Use Default Location' checkbox, the text in the edit box should not get cleared.
