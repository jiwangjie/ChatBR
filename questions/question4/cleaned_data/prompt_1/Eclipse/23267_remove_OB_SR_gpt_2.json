  "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to the 'Import Project' feature.\n3. Observe that there is no default folder pre-selected.\n4. Manually select a folder to import a project.\n5. Close the application and reopen it.\n6. Repeat steps 1-4 and observe if the application remembers the last folder used for importing."
