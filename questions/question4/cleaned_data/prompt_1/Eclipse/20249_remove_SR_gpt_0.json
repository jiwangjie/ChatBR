However, the help window closes immediately, preventing the user from reading the contents.", "EB": "If there is no F1 help defined for the change editor menu, pressing F1 should not display anything to avoid unnecessary flashing. The same problem exists for the change viewer and change perspective menus. In addition, none of the actions under Window > Keyboard Shortcuts have any F1 help defined to describe their functionality.", "SR": "The help window should stay open when F1 is pressed in the change editor menu, allowing the user to read its contents. F1 help should also be added for the change viewer, change perspective menus, and the actions under Window > Keyboard Shortcuts."}
