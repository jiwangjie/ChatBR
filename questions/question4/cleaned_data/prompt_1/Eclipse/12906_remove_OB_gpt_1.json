  "description": "Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] If a file is already opened in one editor, it cannot be opened in another editor, but it should give an error or warning message.",
  "OB": "When attempting to open a Java file in the Java Perspective that is already open in the workbench, there is no warning or error message.",
  "EB": "However, there should be a warning or error message when trying to open a file that is already open in the workbench, indicating the potential for overwriting changes.",
  "SR": "1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file.\n2. If not, go to the file explorer, double-click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n3. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and choose 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n4. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the Java file opened; close it.\n5. Go to the Java Perspective, open a Java file by double-clicking on it.\n6. Now, right-click on the Java file and choose 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n7. Observe that nothing happens; there should be a warning message in the workbench stating that you may overwrite changes, and asking if you want to continue, or an error message indicating that you should close all files first.\nNote: We believe it's a safety feature where WSAD doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."
