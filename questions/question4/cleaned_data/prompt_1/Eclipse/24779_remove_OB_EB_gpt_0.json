It has been observed that when a view from a plugin is removed or moved, the reference to that view in the perspective is not removed, resulting in an error message when attempting to switch to or restore that perspective. However, upon restarting Eclipse, the error messages no longer appear.", "OB": "When opening a view belonging to a plugin (such as the EditorList plugin) and then switching to another perspective (e.g., the 'Java' perspective), the perspective with two opened perspectives, closing Eclipse without removing/moving the plugin, and finally switching back to the perspective that contains the previously opened view (which no longer exists), the 'Unable to restore perspective ...' error message appears.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open Eclipse\n2. Open a view from a plugin (e.g., EditorList plugin)\n3. Switch to another perspective (e.g., 'Java' perspective)\n4. Close Eclipse without removing/moving the plugin\n5. Restart Eclipse\n6. Switch back to the perspective that previously contained the view (which no longer exists)\n7. Observe that the 'Unable to restore perspective ...' error message no longer appears."}
