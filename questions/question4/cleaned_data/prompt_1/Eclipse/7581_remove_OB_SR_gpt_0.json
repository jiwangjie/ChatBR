", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. The expected behavior is for the combo box to always match the width of the property sheet column. However, currently it does not. It should function in the same way as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. It needs further investigation to determine whether the issue lies with our code or with SWT.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not resize correctly in the property sheet.
