However, the help window closes immediately, before the contents can be read. If there is no F1 help defined, then pressing F1 should not display anything to avoid flashing. The same problem exists for the change viewer and change perspective menus. None of the actions under Window > Keyboard Shortcuts have any F1 help defined, so it's unclear what they do.", "SR": "When the change editor menu is open, pressing F1 should display some help. However, the help window closes immediately, before the contents can be read. If there is supposed to be F1 help defined for the change editor menu, then the help window should stay open for the user to read."}
