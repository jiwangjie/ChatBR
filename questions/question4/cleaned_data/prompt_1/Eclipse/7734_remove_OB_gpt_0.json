{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without save file warnings", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "When shutting down the system, a dialog box should be displayed with the message 'Do you want to save your file? Yes, No, Cancel' options. Selecting 'Yes' should save the file, selecting 'No' should proceed with the shutdown without saving, and selecting 'Cancel' should halt the shutdown process. It would also be helpful to allow applications to control the shutdown and save process, as well as allowing them to display their own warning windows. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start WSWB and create a new project. 2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. 3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. 4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer. The expected result is a warning or question message box that gives users a chance to save their dirty file(s) before the computer is shut down/rebooted. Currently, there is no warning or question message box, and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) display a similar warning or prompt to save unsaved changes."}
