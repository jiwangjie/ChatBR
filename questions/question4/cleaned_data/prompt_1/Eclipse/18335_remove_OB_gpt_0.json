{"id": "18335", "title": "Perspective contents lost when view is maximized", "description": "When switching to a different perspective and then exiting the workbench, the contents of the perspective are lost when the view is maximized.", "OB": "Currently, when the workbench is closed, the temporary layout is getting persisted instead of the proper layout.", "EB": "The expected behavior should be that the proper layout is persisted when the workbench is closed, so that when it is reopened and the perspective with the maximized view is selected, the contents of the perspective are not lost.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Switch to another perspective.\n2. Exit the workbench.\n3. Open the workbench.\n4. Switch to the perspective with the maximized view.\nThe perspective contents should not be lost and should be displayed correctly."}
