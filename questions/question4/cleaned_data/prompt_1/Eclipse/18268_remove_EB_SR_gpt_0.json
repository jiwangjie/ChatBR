{"id": "18268", "title": "Bug 18268 - Not finding images and files in NL-specific subdirectories", "description": "When using build 200205291235Setup of Eclipse, there is an issue where images and files in NL-specific subdirectories are not being found. To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Start Eclipse.\n2. Delete the 'eclipselg.gif' file located in '<install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/'.\n3. Edit the 'about.ini' file located in '<install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/'.\n4. Change the value of the 'aboutImage' property to 'aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif'.\n5. Edit the 'about.ini' file again.\n6. Change the value of the 'aboutImage' property to 'aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif'.\n7. Open the about dialog.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- The about dialog should display the main image.\n\nActual Behavior:\n- The main image is not displayed, indicating that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to 'IPluginDescriptor.find', but the '$nl$' path segment is not being handled correctly.\n\nThis suggests that there is a bug in the code responsible for handling the '$nl$' path segment, leading to the issue where images and files in NL-specific subdirectories are not found.", "OB": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
