Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are the only ones relative to the location of the FontRegistry class, org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "When trying to create an instance of the FontRegistry for the application, a MissingResourceException is thrown. The code snippet used is as follows:com.company.product.MyClasspublic void createFontRegistry(){FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");}", "EB": "Instead of directly instantiating the FontRegistry, if the ResourceBundle is used as shown in the code snippet below, no exception is thrown:com.company.product.MyClasspublic void createFontRegistry(){ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");}", "SR": "When using the FontRegistry class from the org.eclipse.jface.resource package in com.company.product package, a MissingResourceException is thrown. However, if a complete copy of the FontRegistry class is created in the com.company.product package, it works. This suggests that there is a bug in the FontRegistry class."}
