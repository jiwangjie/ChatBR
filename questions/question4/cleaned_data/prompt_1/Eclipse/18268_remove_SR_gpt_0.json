The issue can be reproduced by following these steps:\n\n1. Start eclipse.\n2. Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif.\n3. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif'.\n4. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini and change the value of the aboutImage property to 'aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif'.\n5. Open the about dialog.\n\nUpon opening the about dialog, it was expected that there would be a main image displayed. However, there was no main image observed.\n\nThis suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but the '$nl$' path segment is not being handled correctly.", "OB": "Open the about dialog and observe that there is a main image.", "EB": "Open the about dialog and observe that there is no main image. Expectation: The main image should have been found in step 6.", "SR": "The UI should handle the '$nl$' path segment correctly and display the main image in the about dialog as expected."}
