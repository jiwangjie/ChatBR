The 'java' perspective is displayed. Then, if eclipse is closed and restarted, the same error message is displayed again. This behavior is unexpected and needs to be fixed.", "OB": "When a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view, an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of eclipse until the perspective is displayed at least once.", "EB": "The 'Unable to restore perspective' error message should not be displayed after the perspective has been displayed once. It should only be displayed when there is a genuinely unavailable view.", "SR": "The workbench needs to be modified to remove references to invalid views in nondisplayed perspectives, so that the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is not displayed after the perspective has been displayed at least once."}
