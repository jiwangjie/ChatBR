  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ",
  "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. If any string in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to the width of the largest item, causing the drop-down button to be off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped.",
  "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should resize appropriately in the property sheet, ensuring that the drop-down button remains within the visible area, regardless of the width of the strings in the editor.",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit objects with rows of name-value pairs in two columns.\n3. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n4. Ensure that the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Observe that the combo box grows to the width of the largest item, causing the drop-down button to be off the visible area and clipped."
