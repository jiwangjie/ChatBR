Instead, it shows the desktop, my computer, etc., without providing a good default location. It would be better if the dialog defaulted to the default content location.", "EB": "It would be convenient if the import dialog remembered the last folder from which I imported a project.", "SR": "Modify the import dialog to include a default folder that points to the default content location. Additionally, add functionality to remember the last folder used for project import."}
