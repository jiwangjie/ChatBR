Problems with 'Go Into' action ", "OB": "From a clean F1 build, import all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant). Perform the following actions: go into, go up, go back, go back. The actions work fine. Close the project. The 'forward' action is still enabled, but the first forward goes to a blank screen. Click it, and it doesn't seem to do anything. Notice that 'Go Into' is now disabled.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
