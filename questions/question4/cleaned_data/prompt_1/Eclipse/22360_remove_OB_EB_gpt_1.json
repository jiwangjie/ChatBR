  "description": "Bug 22360[Fonts] FontRegistry cannot be instantiated using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource. Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are the only ones relative to the location of the FontRegistry class in the org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.",
  "OB": "Getting MissingResourceException when attempting to create a FontRegistry instance for the application.",
  "EB": "FontRegistry instantiation should not result in MissingResourceException when using resources outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource path.",
  "SR": "1. Create a class in com.company.product package, e.g., MyClass.\n2. Define a method createFontRegistry() in MyClass.\n3. Inside createFontRegistry(), attempt to create FontRegistry instance with the code:\n   ```java\n   FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n   ```\n4. Observe the MissingResourceException.\n5. Try an alternative approach in createFontRegistry() using ResourceBundle:\n   ```java\n   ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n   ```\n6. Note the absence of exceptions with this approach.\n7. Duplicate the FontRegistry class in the com.company.product package and test again to verify if the issue persists."
