{"id": "18335", "title": "Bug 18335 - Perspective contents lost when view is maximized", "description": "", "OB": "When a view is maximized in F1, all the contents of the perspective (including other views and layout information) are lost. Only the maximized view is present, while all other views are missing.", "EB": "The current implementation of view maximize code replaces the page layout with a temporary layout that only contains the maximized view. This temporary layout is getting persisted instead of the proper layout when the workbench is closed.", "SR": "The issue needs to be investigated and fixed so that when a view is maximized, the proper layout with all the views and layout information is retained even after closing and reopening the workbench."}
