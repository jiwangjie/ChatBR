Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are only relative to the location of the FontRegistry class (org.eclipse.jface.resource path). It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "I get a MissingResourceException when I try to create a FontRegistry instance for my application. Here is the code I am using:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nI have a file named `fonts.properties` in the `com/company/product/` folder. However, if I try the following code instead:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nThere is no exception. Moreover, if I create a complete copy of the FontRegistry class in my `com.company.product` package, then it works. My guess is that it is a bug in the FontRegistry. It tries to load the fonts resource bundle, but the FontRegistry's class loader is used to do that (see `readResourceBundle(String)` method in FontRegistry).", "EB": "The FontRegistry class does not allow the instantiation of fonts using resources located outside the `org.eclipse.jface.resource` path. This limitation causes a `MissingResourceException` when attempting to create a FontRegistry instance with resources from a different location.", "SR": "To fix this issue, modify the FontRegistry class to accept a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter in the constructor. This will allow the FontRegistry to load resources from any location specified by the client, rather than being limited to the `org.eclipse.jface.resource` path."}
