{"id": "17758", "title": "Problems with 'Go Into' action in Navigator View", "description": "When performing the 'Go Into' action in the Navigator View, there are several issues that arise. Firstly, after importing all plugins from the runtime environment and packing a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant), the 'Go Into' action works fine. However, when going back and forth using the 'Go back' and 'Go up' actions, the first forward goes to a blank screen. Additionally, clicking the forward action doesn't seem to do anything, and the 'Go Into' action becomes disabled. Another issue is that even with some history, opening another project (e.g., org.eclipse.lucene) and selecting a folder (e.g., 'bin') still enables the 'Go Into' action.", "OB": "From a clean F1 build, import all plugins from the runtime environment and pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant). Perform the 'Go Into' action, then go back and up using the appropriate actions. The first forward should go to a blank screen. Clicking the forward button should have no effect, and the 'Go Into' action should become disabled. Open another project (e.g., org.eclipse.lucene) and select a folder (e.g., 'bin'). The 'Go Into' action should still be enabled.", "EB": "Perhaps closing projects should clean up the history, or some text should appear in the Navigator View indicating that the project is closed. Additionally, when opening another project and selecting a folder, the 'Go Into' action should be disabled if there is no valid content to navigate into.", "SR": "Investigate and fix the issues with the 'Go Into' action in the Navigator View. Ensure that the forward action works as expected and that the 'Go Into' action is properly disabled when necessary. Consider cleaning up the history when closing projects and displaying relevant text in the Navigator View. Also, ensure that the 'Go Into' action is disabled when there is no valid content to navigate into."}
