{"id": "19933", "title": "Bug 19933: Emacs keybinding service always clears the status line", "description": "The current behavior of the keybinding service in Emacs is that it always clears the status line, preventing any message from being shown. However, there are cases where the action could have written to the status line, but we currently lack the necessary API to retrieve the message from the status line. This limitation makes it impossible to solve the problem in general. However, we can address the issue for some cases by modifying the behavior in the default mode to not clear the status line.", "OB": "The current behavior of the keybinding service in Emacs is that it always clears the status line.", "EB": "In the default mode, the keybinding service should not clear the status line to allow messages to be shown.", "SR": "Implement a change in the default mode of the keybinding service to prevent the clearing of the status line after running an action, thus allowing messages to be displayed."}
