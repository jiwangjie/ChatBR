However, this should be an error dialog instead of a warning dialog, as the user should not be allowed to leave the page without fixing the mistake.", "EB": "When invalid data is entered on any preference page and it is flagged with a red highlight in the UI, attempting to select another page without resolving the issue should display an error dialog instead of a warning dialog. The error dialog should clearly indicate that the currently displayed page contains invalid values and prevent the user from leaving the page without fixing the mistake.", "SR": "The preference pages should be updated to display an error dialog instead of a warning dialog when invalid data is present. The error dialog should clearly state that the currently displayed page contains invalid values and prevent the user from switching to another page until the mistake is fixed."}
