{"id": "19933", "title": "Bug 19933: Emacs keybinding service always clears the status line", "description": "The keybinding service in Emacs always clears the status line, even though some actions may have written to it. Currently, there is no API available to retrieve the message in the status line, making it impossible to solve the problem in general. However, the problem can be partially solved by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When running Emacs with keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by the 'AcceleratorScope.resetMode' function. Additionally, when a mode is entered, the key sequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "The 'AcceleratorScope.resetMode' function is intended to clean up the status line after the appropriate action has been executed.", "SR": "Provide an API that allows retrieving the message in the status line, in order to solve the problem of always clearing the status line in Emacs keybindings. Alternatively, consider modifying 'AcceleratorScope.resetMode' to not clear the status line when running in the default mode."}
