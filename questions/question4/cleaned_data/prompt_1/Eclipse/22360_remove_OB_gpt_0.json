Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are the only ones relative to the location of the FontRegistry classorg.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "The current issue is that the FontRegistry class does not allow the use of resources located outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource package. This becomes a problem when trying to instantiate the FontRegistry using resources from a different location.", "EB": "The FontRegistry class should be modified to accept a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor. This would allow the instantiation of FontRegistry using resources from any location.", "SR": "I encounter a MissingResourceException when attempting to create a FontRegistry instance for my application. The code snippet I am using is as follows: com.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n\tFontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nI have confirmed that I do have a file named fonts.properties located in com/company/product/ folder. However, if I use the ResourceBundle class instead, as shown in the following code snippet:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n\tResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nNo exception is thrown. Additionally, if I make a complete copy of the FontRegistry class in my com.company.product package, it works. Based on my observations, I suspect that this is a bug in the FontRegistry class."}
