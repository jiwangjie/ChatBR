Therefore, a UI window should be provided in the Preferences menu to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. The available options should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The responsibility of providing this UI should fall on the Workbench, as all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "Implement a UI window in the Preferences menu for defining the default line delimiters for new files.
