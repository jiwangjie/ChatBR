", "OB": "When the plugin was available in a previous session of Eclipse, and a view belonging to the plugin was opened in a certain perspective, removing or moving the plugin results in an error message 'Unable to restore perspective...' when switching to the perspective containing the view that no longer exists.", "EB": "The plugin was not available the last time Eclipse was closed, so the workbench should have no more reference to this plugin. When removing or moving the plugin, and then switching to the perspective which contains the view that no longer exists, there should be no 'Unable to restore perspective...' error message.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open eclipse. 2. Open a view that belongs to a plugin that can be easily added and removed (for example, the EditorList plugin). 3. Open another perspective (such as the 'Java' perspective). 4. Close eclipse. 5. Remove or move the plugin. 6. Switch to the perspective which contains the view that no longer exists. 7. The 'Unable to restore perspective...' error message should appear. 8. Close and restart eclipse. 9. No more error messages should be displayed."}
