{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120: MRU File List is not persisted between sessions", "description": "", "OB": "The bug is about the MRU File List not being persisted between sessions. When files are opened, they should appear in the File menu MRU list. However, currently, the files do not appear in the MRU list. This behavior should be changed so that the MRU File List is persisted between sessions. Note that we should be using the IPersistableElement and not peek into the implementation to get the underlying resource. The IEditorInput may not necessarily be a resource.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
