To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start eclipse\n2. Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif\n3. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini\n   - Change the value of the aboutImage property: aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif\n4. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini\n   - Change the value of the aboutImage property: aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif\n5. Open the about dialog\n\nObservation:\nThere is a main image again.\n\nThis suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but that the '$nl$' path segment is not being handled correctly.", "OB": "Open the about dialog\n\nExpectation: There should be a main image.", "EB": "When the about dialog is opened, there is no main image displayed.", "SR": "Investigate and fix the issue where the main image is not being found when opening the about dialog."}
