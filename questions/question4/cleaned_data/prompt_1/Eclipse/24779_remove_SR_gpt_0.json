{"id": "24779", "title": "Bug 24779[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed", "description": "Bug 24779[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed. When a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), a 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of Eclipse, until the perspective is displayed one time. The 'java' perspective is displayed, then Eclipse is restarted. A 'Unable to restore perspective ...' error message is displayed, even though the plugin was removed. When Eclipse is closed and restarted, the same 'Unable to restore perspective ...' error message is displayed, indicating that the workbench is still trying to create this view. This behavior is unexpected and needs to be addressed.", "OB": "The workbench should remove the reference to the invalid view when the corresponding plugin is removed.", "EB": "The plugin was not available the last time Eclipse was closed, so the workbench should have no more reference to this plugin.", "SR": "Ensure that the workbench removes references to invalid views when the corresponding plugin is removed, preventing the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message from being displayed after each launch of Eclipse."}
