{"id": "17758", "title": "Bug 17758: Problems with 'Go Into' action in Navigator View", "description": "When using the 'Go Into' action in the Navigator View, there are several problems that occur. After performing the following steps: 1. Import all plugins from runtime environment to get some projects. 2. Pack a project (e.g. org.eclipse.ant). 3. Go into a project. 4. Go up. 5. Go back. The issue arises at this point. Although the 'Go back' action works fine, the 'Forward' action is still enabled but clicking on it leads to a blank screen. Clicking 'Forward' and then clicking 'Back' resolves the issue. This behavior can be observed after performing these steps on a clean F1 build.", "OB": "The 'Forward' action in the Navigator View is enabled even though clicking on it leads to a blank screen.", "EB": "The 'Forward' action in the Navigator View should be disabled when it leads to a blank screen.", "SR": "Update the Navigator View functionality to disable the 'Forward' action when it would lead to a blank screen."}
