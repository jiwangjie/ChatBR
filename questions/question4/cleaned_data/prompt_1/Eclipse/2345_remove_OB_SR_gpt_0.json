Specifically, when following the steps in 1GEWMOZ: ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example opens on XML files by default new basic project new file test.xml the editor used is the scripted resource editor example, which totally ignores the XML file content, and then selecting test.xml in the Navigator and choosing Open With... / Default Text Editor, nothing happens; it simply reactivates the scripted resource editor example.", "EB": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the 1GEWMOZ: ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example.\n2. Create a new basic project.\n3. Create a new file named test.xml.\n4. The editor used by default for test.xml is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content.\n5. Open the Navigator and select test.xml.\n6. Right-click on test.xml and choose Open With... / Default Text Editor.\n7. Expected behavior: A new editor should open for test.xml because the editor type is different.\n\nNOTES:", "SR": "The bug needs to be fixed so that opening a file that is already open in an editor with a different type of editor correctly opens a new editor for the file."}
