Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as 'foo.txt').\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and choose 'Zip File' to export.\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects, give the zip file a name (such as 'test.zip'), and start the export to zip file.\n\nResults:\nAn error message box pops up indicating that problems were encountered during the export process. The details section of the error message lists the file with the same name in project 2 as the problem.", "OB": "When attempting to export multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, an error message is displayed indicating that problems were encountered during the export process. The file with the same name in project 2 is identified as the cause of the problem.", "EB": "The export process should succeed without any errors, allowing users to export multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file without any conflicts.", "SR": "Investigate and fix the issue causing the export process to fail when multiple files with the same name are present under different directories. Ensure that the export process can handle and distinguish between files with the same name correctly."}
