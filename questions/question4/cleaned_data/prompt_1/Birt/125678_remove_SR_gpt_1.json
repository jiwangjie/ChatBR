  "title": "Bug 125678: Original chart instance in report design handle not modified after running the report",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "In my application, when obtaining the design-time instance of the chart and calling the method to run the report, the original chart instance in the report design handle remains unmodified. This behavior is observed in BIRT RC and 2.0 version, whereas it was working correctly until BIRT 2.0M3.",
  "EB": "I expect the chart instance to be modified and bound with data after running the report, as it was functioning correctly until BIRT 2.0M3. However, in BIRT RC and 2.0 version, the original chart instance in the report design handle remains unchanged after running the report.",
  "SR": "1. Open the application and access the report design handle.\n2. Obtain the design-time instance of the chart.\n3. Call the method to run the report.\n4. Verify that the chart instance is modified and bound with data.\nNote: This issue is reproducible in BIRT RC and 2.0 version, but not in versions prior to BIRT 2.0M3."
