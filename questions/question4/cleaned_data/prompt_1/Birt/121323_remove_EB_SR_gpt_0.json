{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression includes a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can cause various issues and should be addressed.", "OB": "The issue occurs when entering an XPath expression with a selection part in the XML Edit Data Set dialog.
