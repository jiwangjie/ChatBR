However, the original chart instance in the report design handle is not modified after running the report. I expect the chart to be bound with data after running the report. This functionality was working fine until BIRT 2.0M3, but it's not working as expected in BIRT RC and 2.0 version.", "EB": "The issue occurs when running the report in my application. Despite obtaining the design time instance of the chart and calling the method to run the report, the original chart instance in the report design handle remains unmodified. This leads to the chart not being bound with data after running the report. The problem started to occur in BIRT RC and 2.0 version, as it was working correctly in BIRT 2.0M3.", "SR": ""}
