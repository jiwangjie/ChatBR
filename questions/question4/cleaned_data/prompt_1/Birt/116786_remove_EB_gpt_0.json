{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer is currently storing the absolute path instead of the relative path. For example, I noticed that the report design includes the absolute path: <property name=\"fileName\"/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property><property name=\"namespace\">lib1</property>. We need to modify the behavior so that the relative path is saved instead.", "EB": "", "SR": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when a library is included in a report design. For instance, if the report design is located at $project/test and we include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be used instead of the absolute path."}
