{"id": "131649", "title": "Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. The expression row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"] does not run. The correct behavior when the user double clicks on \"COUNTRY\" is to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the \"rows\" array represents the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, etc.).\n\nNow imagine that the designer wants to append a country name suffix to each employee name (e.g., \"Diane Merphy / USA\"). An expression row[\"COUNTRY\"] is added to the expression text. The problem is that row[\"OFFICECODE\"] is not valid in the inner table. In order for the inner table to access the outer table's columns, the expression needs to use the \"rows\" object.", "OB": "When the expression row[\"OFFICECODE\"] is used in the inner table, it is not valid. To access the outer table's columns, the expression needs to use the \"rows\" object.", "EB": "The designer should update the expression in the inner table to use the \"rows\" object for accessing the outer table's columns.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). Double click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression. Click on \"Available Data Sets\", choose data set \"offices\", then double click on column \"COUNTRY\"."}
