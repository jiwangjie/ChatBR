  "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
  "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog fails to retain filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part is used for column mapping. Specifically, if the XPath expression includes a selection like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. Upon leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This approach of handling XPath expressions in this manner could potentially lead to various issues.",
  "OB": "Upon entering an XPath expression for column mapping with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. When leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.",
  "EB": "It is recommended to allow the use of plain XPath expressions (preceded by the path from the data set selector itself) without modifying them. This would prevent the stripping of selections and loss of data stored in filterInfo. Filtering functionality can be left as an option for those who specifically require it.",
  "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for column mapping with a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check if RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, and confirm the loss of data stored in filterInfo."
