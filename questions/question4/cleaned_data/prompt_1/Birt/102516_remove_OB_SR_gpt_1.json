  "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand",
  "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.",
  "OB": "Currently, the tables and columns in the tree are loaded immediately upon opening the JDBC Data Set Editor.",
  "EB": "The loading of tables and columns should be deferred until the user either expands the tree or applies a filter. This will enhance performance and responsiveness.",
  "SR": "1. Open JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the tables and columns are loaded automatically.\n3. Expected: Loading should occur only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter."
