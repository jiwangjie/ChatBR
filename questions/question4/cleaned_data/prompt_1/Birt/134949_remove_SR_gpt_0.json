This suggests that the themes are being nested within another library. It is unclear if this method of nesting themes is intended to be used.", "OB": "Open the Library tree of library A in the library explorer and attempt to drop themes from library B into a layout.", "EB": "It seems that users might expect to be able to nest themes in this way.", "SR": "Clarify if nesting themes within libraries is supported functionality and if so, provide guidance on how to do it correctly. If not, consider preventing the nesting of themes within libraries or provide a warning when attempting to do so."}
