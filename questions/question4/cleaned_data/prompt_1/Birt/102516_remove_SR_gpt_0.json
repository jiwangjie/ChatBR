{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Currently, the tree control is being populated on load, causing a warning message to appear. The issue is observed when using the code from CVS on 6/30/05.", "OB": "When using the JTOpen JDBC drivers on the iSeries platform, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor loads every schema on the system on page load, resulting in a large number of tables being displayed. This causes a warning message to appear.", "EB": "The load of the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "Modify the JDBC Data Set Editor to load tables and columns in the tree control on demand when the user expands the tree or applies a filter."}
