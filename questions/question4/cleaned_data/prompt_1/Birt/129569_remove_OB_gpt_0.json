This is a BiDI specific defect. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create DB2 database. 2. Create a user with a Latin name. 3. Create a table under this user with mixed Latin and BiDI name (e.g. \"EMANNMULOC\"). 4. Create a Data Source based on the DB. 5. Create a Data Set based on the table. 6. Add the column name from step 4 to the select portion of the SQL query. 7. Add the table name from step 3 to the from portion of the SQL query. 8. Execute the query. Actual results: 1. The order of BiDI characters in the query window is incorrect. 2. The where portion of the SQL query is missing a condition: \"tomer.tomerREMOT.EMANNMULOC != 'OLLEH world'\". Expected results: 1. The order of BiDI characters in the query window should be correct. 2. The SQL query should include the condition: \"tomer.tomerREMOT.EMANNMULOC != 'OLLEH world'\".", "OB": "The order of BiDI characters in the query window is incorrect.", "EB": "The where portion of the SQL query is missing a condition: \"tomer.tomerREMOT.EMANNMULOC != 'OLLEH world'\".", "SR": "Create a DB2 database.
