The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page currently loads all tables and columns in the data source immediately. This can cause performance issues and slow down the page loading time, especially if the data source has a large number of tables and columns.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page should only load tables and columns in the data source when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve performance and optimize the page loading time.", "SR": "Ensure that the JDBC Data Set Editor page loads tables and columns on demand, rather than loading everything immediately when the page is opened."}
