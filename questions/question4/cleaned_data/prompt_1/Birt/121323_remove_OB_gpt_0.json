{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information after leaving the dialog. This means that any inputted XPath expressions with selection parts are stripped and stored in a HashMap called filterInfo. However, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior can cause trouble for users who rely on filtering in their XPath expressions.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should store and persist filter information, including XPath expressions with selection parts. This will prevent the loss of data in the filterInfo HashMap when leaving the dialog, providing a more reliable and consistent user experience.", "SR": "To fix this bug, the RelationInformation class should be modified to ensure that the filterInfo HashMap is properly persisted to the .rptdesign file when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog. This will ensure that filter information is retained and can be used as intended by the user."}
