{"id": "121974", "title": "Bug 121974: Cannot evaluate global expressions when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop", "description": "Currently, global expressions, such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}, should always be available and evaluable within the BIRT scripting environment. However, when the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop, these global expressions cannot be evaluated properly. The current implementation of Dte scriptExpression only supports three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, and ONEACHROW.", "OB": "The global expressions, such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}, should always be available and evaluable within the BIRT scripting environment, regardless of the ResultIterator's position in the iteration loop.", "EB": "A new GLOBAL expression type should be introduced to handle global expressions when the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop.", "SR": "Ensure that global expressions are evaluated correctly, even when the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop, by implementing a new GLOBAL expression type."}
