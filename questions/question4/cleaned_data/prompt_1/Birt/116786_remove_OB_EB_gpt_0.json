{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer fails to generate and save the relative path.", "OB": "The BIRT designer should automatically generate the relative path for the included library and save it in the report design.", "EB": "Currently, when including a library from a different location than the report design, the BIRT designer does not generate or save the relative path.", "SR": "The BIRT designer needs to be updated to generate and save the relative path for included libraries, based on the location of the report design and the library being included. This will ensure that the correct relative path is maintained even if the report design or library is moved to a different location."}
