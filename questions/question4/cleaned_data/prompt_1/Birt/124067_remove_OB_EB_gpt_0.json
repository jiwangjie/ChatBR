As a result, the user is unable to use relative paths when specifying the location of the file.", "EB": "The application should be updated to allow users to use relative paths when selecting an XML file. This will provide more flexibility in specifying the location of the file and improve the usability of the application.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Create a new data source within the application.\n2. Select a dataset.\n3. Choose an XML file as the data source for the dataset, ensuring that the file is located in a directory relative to the application.\n4. Observe that the application does not accept the relative path and is unable to load the XML file.\n\nExpected behavior: The application should support relative paths when selecting an XML file, allowing the user to successfully load the file and use it as a data source for the dataset."}
