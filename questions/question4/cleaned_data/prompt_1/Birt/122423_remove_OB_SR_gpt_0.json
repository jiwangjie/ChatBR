There can only be one page in case a page number is set.", "OB": "The code currently does not support specifying a range of pages in the RenderTask. It only accepts a single page number. Instead, we need to modify the code to handle a range of page numbers.", "EB": "The code should check if there is a range set. If a range is set, it should parse the range and output each page within the range one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the behavior of the runAndRenderTask function. If an invalid page number is provided, it should be logged and an appropriate error message should be returned. If neither a range nor a page number is set, we should default to rendering all pages instead of giving an error message as the current behavior does.", "SR": "Update the RenderTask code to support specifying a range of pages. Implement the necessary validation to check for a valid page range, log any invalid page numbers, and return an appropriate error message. Additionally, modify the default behavior to render all pages if neither a range nor a page number is set."}
