  "title": "Bug 131649: Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table",
  "description": "This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. An expression like row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"] is expected to run correctly. However, when the user double-clicks on \"COUNTRY\", the correct behavior should be to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the \"rows\" array represents the 0-based index of the nested table, where 0 is the outermost table, 1 is the first-level inner table, and so on.",
  "OB": "The report runs fine.",
  "EB": "When the designer attempts to append a country name suffix to each employee name (e.g., \"Diane Merphy / USA\"), an expression like row[\"COUNTRY\"] is added to the text. The issue arises as row[\"OFFICECODE\"] is not valid in the inner table. To allow the inner table to access the outer table's columns, the expression needs to utilize the \"rows\" object.",
  "SR": "1. Create a design using a 2-level table to list offices and their employees.\n2. Construct an expression like row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"] and ensure it runs correctly.\n3. Double-click on \"COUNTRY\" and observe whether rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] is correctly inserted into the expression.\n4. Attempt to append a country name suffix to each employee name using an expression like row[\"COUNTRY\"] and verify the behavior."
