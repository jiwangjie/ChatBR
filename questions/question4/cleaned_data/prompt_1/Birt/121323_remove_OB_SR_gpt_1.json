  "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
  "description": "The bug report lacks details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. I'll infer and supplement the information for clarity.",
  "OB": "When editing an XML Data Set, the applied filter information is not persisting after closing and reopening the XML Edit Data Set dialog.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the XML Edit Data Set dialog should retain and persist the applied filter information for a given data set, even after the dialog is closed and reopened.",
  "SR": "1. Open the application and navigate to the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Apply a filter to the data set.\n3. Close the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n4. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n5. Check if the previously applied filter information is still present. If not, the bug is reproduced."
