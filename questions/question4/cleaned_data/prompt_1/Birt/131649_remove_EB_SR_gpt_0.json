{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this: row['FIRSTNAME'] + ' ' + row['LASTNAME'] + ' / ' + row['OFFICECODE']. However, this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY' is to insert rows[0]['COUNTRY'] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the 'rows' array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, etc.).", "OB": "When the designer wants to append a country name suffix to each employee name (e.g., 'Diane Merphy / USA'), an expression row['COUNTRY'] is added to the expression text. The problem is that row['OFFICECODE'] is not valid in the inner table. In order for the inner table to access the outer table's columns, the expression needs to use the 'rows' object.", "EB": "The designer should modify the expression to use rows[0]['COUNTRY'] instead of row['COUNTRY'] to correctly reference the outer table's 'COUNTRY' column.", "SR": "Update the designer tool to generate correct column reference expressions for inner tables. When the user double-clicks on a column in the inner table, the expression should use the 'rows' object and specify the correct index to access the relevant column from the outer table."}
