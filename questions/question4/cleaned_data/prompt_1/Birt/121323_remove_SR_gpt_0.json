{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way will likely cause various issues.", "EB": "It would be better to use the plain XPath expression (prepended with the path from the data set selector) and separate filtering as a separate functionality for those who need it.", "SR": ""}
