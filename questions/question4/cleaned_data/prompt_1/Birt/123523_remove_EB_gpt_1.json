  "title": "Bug 123523 - Previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler throws NPE",
  "description": "(See ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath). The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as a cache, or not bother with caching at all.",
  "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, a NullPointerException (NPE) is thrown. The issue arises when attempting to get a class loader from the ExecutionContext, and the context is null (See ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath).",
  "EB": "Previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler should not throw a NullPointerException. The expected behavior is to successfully retrieve a class loader from the ExecutionContext without encountering null context issues (See ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath).",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the application and navigate to the scripted data set preview functionality.\n2. Trigger the preview of a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler.\n3. Observe the NullPointerException being thrown due to the null context issue in ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath."
