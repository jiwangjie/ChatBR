  "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand",
  "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.",
  "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, easily amounting to several hundred tables. Despite the presence of the schema filter in the code from CVS as of 6/30/05, a warning message appears on load as the tree is being populated.",
  "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, and the schema filter should be applied effectively, preventing the warning message on load.",
  "SR": "1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Observe the entire schema being queried, resulting in the warning message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'\n3. Refer to Bug 101372 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372) for the requested ability to filter based on schema."
