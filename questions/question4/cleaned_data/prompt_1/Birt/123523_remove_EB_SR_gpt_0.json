The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as a cache, or not bother with caching at all. ", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a Java event handler, an NPE (NullPointerException) is thrown. This issue occurs because the context is null when trying to retrieve a class loader from the ExecutionContext.", "EB": "To fix this issue, we need to either provide an external map to use as a cache or disable caching altogether.", "SR": "1. Check if the ExecutionContext is properly set before retrieving the class loader.\n2. If the context is null, handle the situation appropriately to avoid the NPE.\n3. Consider implementing a cache mechanism using an external map or disable caching if it is not necessary."}
