{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "", "OB": "The labels returned before extraction are null, while the ones after extraction are recognizable strings.", "EB": "When using the 'get column label' function from the meta data object, it should return user recognizable strings. Currently, the labels returned before extraction are null, while the ones after extraction are recognizable strings. This behavior is inconsistent and should be fixed. The 'get column label' function should return the same labels before and after extraction, as the labels need to be displayed to the end user before carrying out the extraction.", "SR": "Modify the 'get column label' function in the meta data object to ensure that it returns the same user recognizable strings both before and after extraction."}
