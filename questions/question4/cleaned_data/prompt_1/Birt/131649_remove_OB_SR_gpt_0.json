{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this: row['FIRSTNAME'] + ' ' + row['LASTNAME'] + ' / ' + row['OFFICECODE']. However, this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY' is to insert rows[0]['COUNTRY'] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the 'rows' array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first-level inner table, etc.).", "OB": "The generated column reference expression for the inner table is incorrect, causing the report to fail when run. The incorrect expression does not consider the nesting levels of the tables.", "EB": "The report designer should analyze the nesting levels of all tables and appropriately determine the correct index number to use in the column reference expression.", "SR": "To fix this issue, the report designer needs to modify the code to determine and insert the correct index number (0 in this case) for the inner table in the column reference expression."}
