{"id": "132103", "title": "Bug 132103: No objects under Context in palette when scripting a data set", "description": "When scripting a data set in the script view and opening the palette, there are no objects listed under the Context category. This is unexpected as the objects 'this', 'row', and 'reportContext' should be available under Context. Additionally, there should be other objects available for other methods.", "OB": "No objects are listed under the Context category in the palette when scripting a data set. Objects 'this', 'row', and 'reportContext' should be available under Context.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when scripting a data set and opening the palette, the objects 'this', 'row', and 'reportContext' should be listed under the Context category.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new data set and select it. 2. Switch to the script view and choose 'onFetch'. 3. Open the palette and check that there are no objects listed under the Context category."}
