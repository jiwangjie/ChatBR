Currently, the Dte scriptExpression has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, and ONEACHROW.", "OB": "Currently, when the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop, global expressions cannot be evaluated within the BIRT scripting environment.", "EB": "To address this issue, a new GLOBAL expression type should be implemented to allow for the evaluation of these expressions regardless of the row iteration status.", "SR": "Currently, if you try to evaluate these global expressions when the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop, a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException is thrown. However, these global expressions are unrelated to the data row iteration."}
