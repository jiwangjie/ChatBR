    "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
    "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the class RelationInformation. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior of treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues.",
    "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when leaving the dialog. The column mapping XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the class RelationInformation. However, the data stored in filterInfo is lost during the persistence process.",
    "EB": "The issue lies in the handling of XPath expressions in the XML Edit Data Set dialog. Currently, after entering an XPath expression with a selection part, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior can cause a lot of trouble and should be addressed.",
    "SR": "To fix this bug, the XML Edit Data Set dialog should correctly persist the filter information. Specifically, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be retained rather than being lost. Additionally, the handling of XPath expressions in the dialog needs to be revisited to ensure it does not cause any unexpected issues."
