{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. An incorrect expression is generated by the designer, which leads to the report failing to run. The correct behavior should be inserting rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression when the user double clicks on \"COUNTRY\". The index number, 0, represents the nested table's index in the \"rows\" array.", "OB": "The designer is generating a wrong column reference expression for the inner table. When the user double clicks on the \"COUNTRY\" column, the expression should be modified to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] instead.", "EB": "The report designer should determine the correct index number by considering the nesting levels of all the tables.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign).\n2. Double click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression.\n3. Click on \"Available Data Sets\" and select the \"offices\" data set.\n4. Double click on the \"COUNTRY\" column."}
