{"id": "122423", "title": "Support page range in RenderTask", "description": "When using RenderTask, the page range is not currently supported. If a range is specified, it should be parsed and formed into a range, with each page outputted one after another, separated by a page splitter, similar to the runAndRenderTask function. In the case where a page number is set, only that specific page should be outputted. Currently, there can only be one page if a page number is set.", "OB": "The bug report does not provide any information about the observed behavior.", "EB": "When a page range is specified in the RenderTask, the current behavior is to output the whole report and not support the specified range. This needs to be updated to correctly handle the specified range. For PDF format, a message should be logged indicating that the range is not supported. For HTML format, the page range should be supported in the format of \"1,2,510\" + \"All\". Additionally, if no range is set, the code should check if a page number is set.", "SR": "Update the RenderTask to properly support page ranges. For PDF format, log a message indicating that page range is not supported. For HTML format, support the page range in the format of \"1,2,510\" + \"All\".
