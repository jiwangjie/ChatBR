{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Even with the schema filter code implemented from CVS on 6/30/05, there is still a warning message being displayed during the initial load, as the tree is being populated. ", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, causing a delay in loading and eventually displaying the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. This issue is more evident on the iSeries platform with a large number of schemas.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should be modified to load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema on load.", "SR": "Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/showbug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> requests the ability to filter the tree control based on the schema, and this feature should be implemented to address the performance and usability issues mentioned above."}
