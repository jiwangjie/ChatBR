  "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table",
  "description": "This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. An expression like 'row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]' should be valid, but the report does not run. The correct behavior, when the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY', is to insert 'rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]' into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the 'rows' array is the 0-based index of the nested table, which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, etc.).",
  "OB": "The report fails to execute when the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY', and the expression 'rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]' is not automatically inserted.",
  "EB": "The report designer should dynamically determine the correct index number by analyzing the nesting levels of all tables and automatically insert 'rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]' when the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY'.",
  "SR": "1. Create a design with a 2-level table listing offices and their employees.\n2. Construct an expression like 'row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]'.\n3. Attempt to run the report.\n4. Double click on 'COUNTRY'.\n5. Observe that the expression 'rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]' is not inserted automatically."
