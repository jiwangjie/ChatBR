This is a defect related to the BiDI functionality. The issue occurs when performing a query in the Query window. The steps to reproduce the issue are as follows:\n\n1. Create a DB2 database.\n2. Create a user with a Latin name.\n3. Create a table under this user with mixed Latin and BiDI name (e.g. \"EMANNMULOC\").\n4. Create a Data Source based on the DB.\n5. Create a Data Set based on the table.\n6. Add a column name from step 4 to the select portion of the SQL query.\n7. Add the table name from step 3 to the from portion of the SQL query.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nThe BiDI characters in the query window should be displayed in the correct order.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\nThe BiDI characters are displayed in an undesirable order.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Select tomer.tomerEMANNMULOC.REMOT2.\n2. From tomer.tomerREMOT3.\n3. Where tomer.tomerOLLEH' =!.\n\nWorkarounds:\n\nNone at the moment.", "OB": "The BiDI characters in the query window should be displayed in the correct order.", "EB": "The BiDI characters in the query window are displayed in an undesirable order.", "SR": "1.
