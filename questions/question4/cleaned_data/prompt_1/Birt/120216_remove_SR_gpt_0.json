{"id": "120216", "title": "Bug 120216: Group dialog should be shown even if dataset is not set.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, an error is shown when trying to create a table group without setting the dataset. However, as part of the template requirements, the UI should not perform this validation and the group dialog should be shown regardless of whether the dataset is defined or not.", "EB": "To reproduce the issue, add a table report item without setting the dataset. Then, try to create a new table group. The user is not able to define a group because the group dialog is not shown when the dataset is not defined. The expected behavior is that the group dialog should be shown and the user should be able to define a group, even if the dataset is not defined.", "SR": ""}
