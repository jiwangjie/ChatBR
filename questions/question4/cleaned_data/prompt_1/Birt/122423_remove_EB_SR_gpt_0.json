If a page range is specified, parse it and output the pages one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the runAndRenderTask function. If the page range consists of only one page number, output that specific page. Otherwise, output the whole report. Invalid page numbers should be logged, and an error message returned if necessary.", "OB": "The render task should be updated to support page ranges. For PDF format, if a page range is specified, log a message stating that page range is not supported, but still output the whole report. For HTML format, page ranges should be supported in the format of '1,2,510' + 'All'. If an invalid page number is encountered, it should be logged, and an appropriate error message should be returned.", "EB": "The render task does not currently support page ranges. This feature needs to be implemented in order to allow users to specify page ranges when rendering documents. For PDF format, if a page range is specified, a message should be logged to inform the user that page range is not supported, but the entire report will still be outputted. For HTML format, page ranges should be supported using the format '1,2,510' + 'All'. Any invalid page numbers encountered should be logged, and an error message should be returned.", "SR": "1.
