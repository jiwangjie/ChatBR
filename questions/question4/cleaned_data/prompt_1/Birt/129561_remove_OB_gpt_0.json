This is not only an NLS-specific defect but also occurs when a table name includes a blank in this database. When selecting 'Preview Results', an exception is fired. The expected result should be to get something like 'select USER.Table Name.Column Name'.", "OB": "When creating a table with a name that includes a blank in this database and selecting 'Preview Results', an exception is fired.", "EB": "You should get something like 'select USER.Table Name.Column Name' when creating a table with a name that includes a blank in this database and selecting 'Preview Results'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
