  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the instance stored by the content stream should not be duplicated. Data should only be stored once either by the content stream or DtE.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue are unclear. However, the bug seems to manifest during report generation. Please provide specific steps to reproduce the problem, including any relevant configuration or input data."
