{"id": "122423", "title": "Bug 122423: Support page range in RenderTask", "description": "Bug 122423: Support page range in RenderTask. If a page range is specified, parse it and output the pages one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the runAndRenderTask. If only one page number is set, only that page should be outputted. If no range is set, output the whole report. Invalid page numbers should be logged and an error message should be returned.", "OB": "The render task should support page range for PDF format. If a range is specified, a message should be logged indicating that the range is not supported, and the whole report should still be outputted. For HTML format, the page range should be supported in the format of '1,2,510' + 'All'. Invalid page numbers should be logged, and an error message should be returned.", "EB": "The render task code should check if a page range is set. If a range is specified, invalid page numbers should be logged, and an error message should be returned. If neither a range nor a page number is set, the render task should default to outputting all pages, instead of giving an error message.", "SR": "1. Modify the render task to support page range for PDF format.\n2. Log a message indicating that a page range is not supported when a range is specified, but still output the whole report.\n3. Improve the support for page range in the HTML format by allowing the range to be in the form of '1,2,510' + 'All'.\n4. Log invalid page numbers and return an error message.\n5. Update the render task code to check if a page range or a single page number is set.\n6. If no range or page number is set, default to outputting all pages instead of giving an error."}
