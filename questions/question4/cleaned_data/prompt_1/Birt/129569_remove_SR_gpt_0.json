This is a BiDI specific defect. \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the Query window in the Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Make sure that the table has columns with BiDi name (e.g. \"EMANNMULOC\").\n3. Enter the following SQL query: 'select tomer.tomerEMANNMULOC.REMOT from tomer.tomerREMOT where tomer.tomerOLLEH' != 'world'.\n\nActual results:\n- In the first and third rows of the result, the order of characters is completely ruined, making it impossible to read the query. In the first row, the name of the column and part of the table name are switched. In the third row, part of the constant, table name, and column name are mixed.", "OB": "The issue is similar to another defect that was reported for the Expression Builder dialog. However, in this defect, we are specifically referring to the context of the Query screen in the Edit Data Set dialog. The capitalized characters used in the examples below represent BiDi (Hebrew or Arabic) characters.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. The order of characters in the query should be maintained.\n2. The names of the table and columns should not be switched or mixed up.", "EB": "To fix this issue, please add the following condition to the WHERE portion of the SQL query: tomer.tomerREMOT.EMANNMULOC != 'OLLEH world'.\n\nExpected results:\n1. The query should display correctly without any character order issues.", "SR": "Investigate and Fix the issue causing the undesirable order of BiDi characters in the Query window in the Edit Data Set dialog."}
