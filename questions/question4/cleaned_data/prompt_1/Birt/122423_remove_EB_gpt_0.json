If an invalid page number is encountered, it should be logged, and an error message returned.", "EB": "N/A", "SR": "For PDF format, if a page range is specified, log a message stating that range is not supported and still output the entire report.  \n\nFor HTML format, support page range in the format of '1,2,510' + 'All'.
