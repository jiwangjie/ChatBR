{"id": "121974", "title": "Can't evaluate global expressions when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop", "description": "For global expressions, such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}, it should always be available and evaluable within the BIRT scripting environment. Currently, the Dte script expression has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, and ONEACHROW. However, BEFOREFIRSTROW only works when the cursor is just entering the first row, and AFTERLASTROW only works when the cursor is just leaving the last row. Once the iteration is finished, both types won't work anymore. A 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException will be thrown if you try to evaluate these expressions. However, these global expressions have nothing to do with the data row iteration. Additionally, the current BEFOREFIRSTROW/AFTERLASTROW names are misleading and should be changed to ONSTARTROW and ONENDROW, respectively, to provide more clarity. This bug is currently preventing charts from evaluating non-data row expressions (such as expressions from title URL actions) that are not within a data row iteration (charts need to evaluate these expressions from actions after data binding).", "OB": "The BEFOREFIRSTROW and AFTERLASTROW types are misleading and should be renamed to ONSTARTROW and ONENDROW for clarity. Additionally, a new GLOBAL expression type is required to indicate the need for evaluating global expressions outside of the data row iteration.", "EB": "Global expressions should always return the correct result value when evaluated within the BIRT scripting environment. A new GLOBAL expression type should be introduced to mark the need for evaluating these expressions outside of the data row iteration.", "SR": "1.
