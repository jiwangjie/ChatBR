  "title": "Bug 131649: Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table",
  "description": "This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. An expression like row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"] is used, but it does not run. The correct behavior when the user double-clicks on \"COUNTRY\" is to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the \"rows\" array is the 0-based index of the nested table (0 = outermost table, 1 = first-level inner table, etc.).",
  "OB": "The report currently runs fine.",
  "EB": "The report designer should determine the correct index number by examining the nesting levels of all tables.",
  "SR": "1. Open the report design with a 2-level table listing offices and employees.\n2. Add an expression row[\"COUNTRY\"] to the existing expression text.\n3. Double-click on \"COUNTRY\" in the report.\n4. Observe the error related to the invalid reference of row[\"OFFICECODE\"] in the inner table."
