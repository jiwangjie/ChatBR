Currently, the dataset contains 10 records (DataResultA).", "OB": "The expected behavior is that when a filter (FilterA) is applied to the dataset, it should return 6 records (DataResultB).", "EB": "However, the actual behavior is that the filter is not properly applied and the output does not match the expected 6 records.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a report and add a new data source and a dataset.\n2. Apply a filter (FilterA) to the dataset.\n3. Verify that the output contains 6 records (DataResultB) based on the applied filter."}
