{"id": "124620", "title": "Bug 124620: Referenced Parameter icon should be invalid if the parameter in library is deleted", "description": "", "OB": "When a report scalar parameter is inserted and a report is created using a library, the parameter is pulled into the data explorer view of the report in the library explorer. If the parameter is deleted from the library and the report design file is reopened, the icon of the parameter in the report should appear as invalid.", "EB": "Currently, when the above steps are followed, the icon of the parameter in the report appears unchanged, giving the impression that nothing happened to the parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Insert a report scalar parameter.\n2. Create a report using the above library.\n3. In the library explorer, pull the parameter to the data explorer view of the report.\n4. Open the library file and delete the parameter.\n5. Reopen the report design file and observe that the icon of the parameter appears unchanged, instead of appearing as invalid."}
