This is because the context is used to obtain a class loader from the ExecutionContext, which is necessary for using cached class loaders. Currently, there is no mechanism in place to handle the scenario when the context is null. One possible solution is to use an external map as cache, or alternatively, not use caching at all.", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, if the context is null, the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath throws a NullPointerException due to the absence of a mechanism to handle this scenario.", "EB": "To handle the case when the context is null, an alternative mechanism needs to be implemented to obtain the class loader instead of relying on the ExecutionContext.", "SR": "Implement a mechanism to handle the scenario when the context is null, ensuring that the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath does not throw a NullPointerException. Consider exploring options such as using an external map as cache or not using caching at all."}
