{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "When working in the XML Report Designer editor, a 'Dirty Page' behavior is observed. Other pages cannot be accessed until the changes are saved or discarded. Currently, a dialog titled 'Error' (including the quotes) is displayed with the message 'Do you want to save the changes? <Yes> <No> <Cancel>'. This dialog does not provide clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes. Moreover, the use of quotes in the dialog title is unnecessary. The behavior and user interface of this dialog need to be improved.", "OB": "The 'Dirty Page' behavior in the XML Report Designer editor prevents access to other pages until changes are saved or discarded.", "EB": "The XML Report Designer should display a dialog titled 'Save Changes' instead of 'Error'. The dialog message should provide clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes, without unnecessary quotes.", "SR": "Improve the behavior and user interface of the XML Report Designer by updating the dialog title to 'Save Changes' and providing clear instructions on saving or discarding the changes without using unnecessary quotes."}
