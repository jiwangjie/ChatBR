{"id": "123523", "title": "Bug 123523: Previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler throws NullPointerException", "description": "When previewing a scripted data set that is mapped to a java event handler, a NullPointerException is thrown at the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath. This is because the context is null in this case. The reason for using the context is to utilize cached class loaders whenever possible. To address this issue, we can either provide an external map to use as a cache or find an alternative mechanism to obtain the class loader if the context is null.", "OB": "Currently, when previewing a scripted data set, if the context is null, a NullPointerException is thrown at the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath.", "EB": "To address this issue, we need to implement an alternative mechanism to get the class loader if the context is null.", "SR": "When previewing a scripted data set, we should try to obtain a class loader from the ExecutionContext to avoid a NullPointerException."}
