{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649: Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "Bug 131649: Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. An expression like row['FIRSTNAME'] + ' ' + row['LASTNAME'] + ' / ' + row['OFFICECODE'] is used, but the report does not run correctly. The expected behavior when the user double-clicks on 'COUNTRY' is to insert rows[0]['COUNTRY'] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the 'rows' array represents the 0-based index of the nested table with the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, and so on).", "OB": "The report runs fine with the given expression.", "EB": "The inner table cannot access the outer table's columns using the expression row['OFFICECODE']. To allow the inner table to access the outer table's columns, the expression should use the 'rows' object.", "SR": "The report designer should determine the correct index number by examining the nesting levels of all tables."}
