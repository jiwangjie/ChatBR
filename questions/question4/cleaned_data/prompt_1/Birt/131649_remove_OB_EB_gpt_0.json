{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649: Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "When constructing an expression using a 2-level table to list offices and their employees, the designer generates an incorrect column reference expression. For example, an expression like `row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]` will not run properly. The user should be able to double click on the \"COUNTRY\" column and have the expression automatically insert `rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]`. The index `0` refers to the 0-based index of the nested table containing the data set (0 for the outermost table, 1 for the first level inner table, etc.).", "OB": "The designer generates an incorrect column reference expression for inner tables.
