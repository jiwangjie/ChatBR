Steps to reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new report. 2. Add a new datasource and a dataset. 3. Create a report parameter. 4. Add a chart to the layout. 5. In the chart dialogue, click the 'select data' tab and click the 'filters' button. 6. Set two filter conditions, one using the 'Top N' function and the other using the report parameter. The expected result is that the chart should be filtered based on the specified conditions, but this is not happening.", "OB": "The 'Top N' and 'Bottom N' functions are not functioning as expected when creating a report.", "EB": "The 'Top N' and 'Bottom N' functions should properly filter the chart data based on the specified conditions.", "SR": "The development team should investigate and fix the issue with the 'Top N' and 'Bottom N' functions not working correctly in the report creation process."}
