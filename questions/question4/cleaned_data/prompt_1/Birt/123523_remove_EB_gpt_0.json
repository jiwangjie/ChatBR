The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all.", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, there is a NullPointerException (NPE) thrown during the process. This is caused by the null context in the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath. This method requires the context to use cached class loaders, if available.", "EB": "To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when the context is null and either provide an external map to use as cache or disable caching altogether.", "SR": "Modify the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath to handle the null context scenario and decide whether to use an external map for caching or disable caching altogether when previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler."}
