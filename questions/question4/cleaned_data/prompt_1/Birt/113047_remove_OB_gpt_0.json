When attempting to do this, the children nodes are not being listed.", "OB": "When changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab, the expected behavior is to list out the children of the new data source.", "EB": "The actual behavior is that no children nodes are being listed when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a data set without a SQL statement. \n2. Open the data set editor and go to the data source page. \n3. Change the data source to a new one. \n4. The new data source does not display any database/table/column information as children nodes. \nTo resolve the issue, close the data set editor and reopen it."}
