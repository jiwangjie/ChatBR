{"id": "123523", "title": "Bug 123523: Previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler throws NPE", "description": "(See ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath). The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all.", "OB": "The current implementation of the script data set preview encounters a NullPointerException when the context is null. This occurs specifically in the method `ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath`. The purpose of using the context is to leverage cached class loaders. However, if the context is null, an alternative mechanism needs to be employed to obtain the class loader.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, we need to implement an alternative mechanism to retrieve the class loader when the context is null.", "SR": "1. Modify the `ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath` method to handle the case when the context is null. Consider using a different mechanism, such as accessing the class loader directly from another source, to avoid the NullPointerException. \n2. Update the documentation and provide clear instructions on how to handle null contexts in the script data set preview process."}
