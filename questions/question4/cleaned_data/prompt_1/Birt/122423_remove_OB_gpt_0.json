{"id": "122423", "title": "Bug 122423 - Support page range in RenderTask", "description": "The current implementation of RenderTask does not support specifying a page range. We need to add support for page range in the RenderTask. If a page range is provided, we should parse it and output the specified pages one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the behavior of the runAndRenderTask method. If a single page number is provided, we should output only that page. Currently, if an invalid page number is set, an error message is not logged and returned. We need to log the invalid page number as an error and return an appropriate error message. Additionally, if neither a page range nor a page number is set, the default behavior should be to output all pages, instead of giving an error message.", "OB": "The code does not support specifying a page range in the RenderTask.

For PDF format, if a page range is specified, simply log a message saying that page range is not supported and still output the whole report. For HTML format, the page range should be supported in the form of '1,2,510' + 'All'. If no page range is set, we should check if a page number is set."}
