{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not persisting filter information.", "OB": "When editing a data set in XML format, the filter information applied in the XML Edit Data Set dialog is not saved or persisted after closing the dialog.", "EB": "Currently, we cannot use a plain XPath expression (prepended with the path from the data set selector itself) and let filtering be optional for those who need it. This functionality should be added so that users can save and persist filter information in the XML Edit Data Set dialog.", "SR": "Implement a solution that allows users to use a plain XPath expression for filtering in the XML Edit Data Set dialog and ensure that the filtering information is saved and persisted even after closing the dialog."}
