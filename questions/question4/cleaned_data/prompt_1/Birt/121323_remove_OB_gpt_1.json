  "title": "Bug 121323XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
  "description": "The bug report lacks specific details regarding the issue.",
  "OB": "Upon exiting the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the XPath expressions with selection parts, such as section[@id='left'], lose their selections. This results in the loss of data stored in the filterInfo HashMap, as RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign without retaining filter information.",
  "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist filter information along with XPath expressions containing selection parts when RelationInformation is saved to .rptdesign. The filterInfo HashMap should accurately store and retain the selection information.",
  "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that within class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Exit the dialog.\n5. Check that RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."
