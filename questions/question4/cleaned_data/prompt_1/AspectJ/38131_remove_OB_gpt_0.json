This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. To reproduce the issue, create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: \n\najc -d subpackage subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\"directory. This behavior differs from javac's behavior.\n\nNo big deal, really.", "OB": "ajc should support the -d option to specify the output directory for compiled classes.", "EB": "But it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac, where the -d option specifies the output directory for compiled classes.", "SR": "Implement support for the -d option in ajc when compiling classes from a subpackage."}
