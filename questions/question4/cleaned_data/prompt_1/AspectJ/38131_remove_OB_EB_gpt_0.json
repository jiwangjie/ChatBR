I am using 1.1rc1. This behavior is a regression since rc1 and differs from javac. I suspect it may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, create a class in a subpackage as shown below:\n\n```java\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen compile the class using the following command:\n\n```\najc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n```\n\nYou will notice that a directory named \"subpackage\" is created within the existing \"subpackage\" directory instead of the root directory. This behavior is not observed when using javac.\n\nThis issue does not have a major impact, but it should still be addressed.", "OB": "ajc should create the compiled class file in the root directory instead of creating a subdirectory with the same name as the subpackage.", "EB": "ajc creates a subdirectory with the same name as the subpackage when compiling a class from a subpackage.", "SR": "Make sure that ajc correctly compiles the classes from subpackages and creates the compiled class file in the root directory instead of creating a subdirectory."}
