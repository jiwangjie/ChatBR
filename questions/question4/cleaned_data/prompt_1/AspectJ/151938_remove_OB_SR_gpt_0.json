{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 - Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "The current behavior of the system is emitting the bytecode when encountering duplicate javaagent entries. However, it would be better to fail and provide an error message instead.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that AspectJ should detect when a javaagent is specified more than once and give a warning, then disable all but one of the agents.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, AspectJ should be modified to detect duplicate javaagent entries and provide appropriate error handling, such as giving a warning message and disabling all but one of the agents."}
