{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using `ajc` with the `outjar` option, the resulting file should be a valid JAR file with a `MANIFEST.MF` file inside. However, currently, when I call `ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar`, the output file is created with a .jar extension but it is not a valid JAR file because there is no `MANIFEST.MF` file inside.", "OB": "With the current implementation, the output JAR file does not include the `MANIFEST.MF` file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the output JAR file should include the `MANIFEST.MF` file.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, the `ajc` command should generate a valid JAR file with a `MANIFEST.MF` file when the `outjar` option is used."}
