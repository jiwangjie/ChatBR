    "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path wrong in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]. See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.) ",
