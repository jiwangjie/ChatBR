{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When declaring warning messages for .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. This issue can be reproduced by running the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory. It is important to note that these tests may produce false positives as the filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. It has been observed in AJDT that if the filename is invalid, AJDT omits it.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. Additionally, there may be cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
