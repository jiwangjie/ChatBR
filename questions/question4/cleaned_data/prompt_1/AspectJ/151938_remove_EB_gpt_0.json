{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 - Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "When the AspectJ's loadtime weaver is specified more than once using the javaagent flag in a Java 5 VM, and there is an aop.xml file defined, the system tries to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits a large amount of bytecode. This can occur if the script is wrapped twice, leading to a duplicate entry.", "EB": "The system should handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully. Instead of trying to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emitting excessive bytecode, it should fail and present an error message to indicate the presence of duplicate entries. This would help prevent issues like the one experienced by our automated installer and other potential users who may manually edit relevant files to add the javaagent flag.", "SR": "To address this issue, the system needs to be enhanced to detect and handle duplicate javaagent entries in a more graceful manner. When encountering multiple entries, it should fail and display an appropriate error message, instead of attempting to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emitting excessive bytecode. This improvement will provide a better user experience and help prevent adverse effects caused by duplicate entries."}
