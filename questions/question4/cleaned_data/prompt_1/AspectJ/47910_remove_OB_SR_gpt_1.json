  "description": "When using the ajc compiler with the outjar option, the resulting JAR file does not contain the expected METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file.",
  "OB": "The generated JAR file should include the required MANIFEST.MF file within the METAINF directory.",
  "EB": "Currently, when the outjar option is used, the resulting file is not a valid JAR file as it lacks the necessary MANIFEST.MF in the METAINF directory.",
  "SR": "Ensure that the ajc compiler, when used with the outjar option, correctly includes the MANIFEST.MF file within the METAINF directory of the generated JAR file."
