{"id": "151938", "title": "Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "If you start a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, and there is an aop.xml file defined, the program encounters a serious error. Instead of handling the duplicate entry gracefully, it attempts to reweave the woven AspectJ code and generates a significant amount of redundant bytecode. This issue can arise when a script is wrapped twice, resulting in a duplicate entry of the javaagent flag.", "EB": "The program should handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully. Instead of attempting to reweave the AspectJ code and emitting excessive bytecode, it should detect the duplicate entry and fail with an appropriate error message.", "SR": "1. Modify the program to handle duplicate javaagent entries in a more graceful manner.\n2. When a duplicate javaagent entry is detected, the program should fail with an informative error message instead of attempting to reweave the AspectJ code and emitting redundant bytecode."}
