{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 - Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "When starting a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, it chokes badly: it tries to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits massive amounts of bytecode. As a result, if the script is wrapped twice, it can generate a duplicate javaagent entry.",
  "EB": "AspectJ should handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully by detecting that it was specified more than once and giving a warning, then disabling all but one of the agents.",
  "SR": "AspectJ should implement a mechanism to detect and handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully. When a duplicate entry is detected, a warning should be issued, and only one instance of the agent should be enabled."
