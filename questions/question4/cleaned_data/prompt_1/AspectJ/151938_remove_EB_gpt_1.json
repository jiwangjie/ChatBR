  "title": "Bug 151938 Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully",
  "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this problem (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)",
  "OB": "When starting a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified multiple times using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, it causes issues. Instead of handling the duplicate entries gracefully, the system tries to reweave the already woven AspectJ code and produces excessive amounts of bytecode.",
  "EB": "The system should handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully when starting a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver. Specifically, if the javaagent flag is specified more than once and there is an aop.xml file defined, the system should not choke and emit excessive bytecode. Instead, it should fail gracefully and provide a clear error message.",
  "SR": "To resolve this issue, the system should be modified to handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully. It should detect the duplicate entries and avoid reweaving the AspectJ code if it has already been woven. Additionally, appropriate error messages should be provided to alert the user about the duplicate entries and prevent the emission of excessive bytecode."
