A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected.", "OB": "The CCombo control is firing the defaultSelection event on mouse list selection.", "EB": "It should fire a selection event instead. Default selection means something was selected and you should go and do something. The typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog. A CCombo shouldn't fire default selection just by selecting an entry in the dropdown. Pressing Enter from the text field should be treated as a default selection.", "SR": "Modify the CCombo control to only fire a selection event on mouse list selection and treat pressing Enter from the text field as a default selection event."}
