  "title": "Bug 45145: Second window comes to front when using first",
  "description": "When working with Eclipse, an issue has been observed where a second window comes to the front unexpectedly.",
  "OB": "When interacting with the first window, the second window occasionally takes focus without explicit user action. This behavior is not intended and disrupts the expected workflow.",
  "EB": "Unless I click on the Eclipse dock icon, the only time a window should come to the front is if I click on it explicitly (or some behavior takes me to a widget in the other window). The focus should not shift unexpectedly during regular interaction with the first window.",
  "SR": "Ensure that window focus behavior aligns with user expectations. Investigate and fix the issue causing the second window to come to the front without explicit user action. Verify that clicking on the Eclipse dock icon remains the primary method for bringing a window to the front."
