This makes the dialog almost unusable as it is impossible to append the correct file extension to the file name.", "OB": "When selecting a file using the SWT FileDialog, the file extension cannot be retrieved.", "EB": "The export wizard should use the file name 'test.zip' when this issue occurs.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Select a java file. \n2) Go to File -> Export... \n3) Select JAR file and click Next. \n4) Click Browse... to select a Save As file dialog. \n5) Enter 'test' for the file name. \n6) Select '.zip' for the 'Save as type' field. \n7) Click Save. \nResult: The JAR export wizard uses 'test' for the JAR file field. \nExpected result: The JAR export wizard should use 'test.zip' for the JAR file field."}
