This behavior is different from standard Combos and can be confusing for users. A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected.\n\nPlease fix this issue so that CCombo behaves consistently with standard Combos.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Drop down the CCombo list using the mouse.\n2. Select an entry from the list using the mouse.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- CCombo should not fire a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse.\n\nActual behavior:\n- CCombo fires a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse.", "OB": "When the drop-down list of the CCombo is opened and an entry is selected using the mouse, a defaultSelection event is fired by the CCombo.
