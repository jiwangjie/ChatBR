{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only), it can be observed that the scrollbars are enabled. However, when attempting to move them, they do not have any effect. This issue becomes more apparent when opening a small image, such as an icon, as the scrollbars are misleading and do not serve any purpose.", "EB": "", "SR": "To resolve this issue, in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only), the scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled to prevent misleading user interaction. This change will improve the usability of the application."}
