  "title": "Revert Operation Slower than Close and Reopen in Java Editor",
  "description": "When performing the revert operation in the Java editor, it is observed to be much slower compared to the close and reopen actions.",
  "OB": "When the 'Revert' option is selected from the pop-up menu in the editor after marking the file dirty, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original. This is noticeably slower than the process of closing the file and reopening it.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'Revert' operation should not take significantly longer than the close and reopen actions. The performance should be more consistent between these operations.",
  "SR": "1. Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open-source repository.\n2. Select the end of the first line and hit a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3. Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n4. Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n5. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n6. Repeat steps 1-5, and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor. Observe and report the time taken for the 'Revert' operation, comparing it with the close and reopen actions."
