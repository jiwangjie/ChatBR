Additionally, the FontMetrics API is also heavily used by the StyledText. I believe that the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and only updated when the font is changed.  It's worth mentioning that UTF-8 is the default English encoding for Redhat 8. Currently, there is a performance issue with the `Font.getFontData` method on certain platforms, such as Motif running on UTF-8. This problem needs to be investigated further to ensure optimal performance.", "OB": "Currently, the StyledText widget is overusing the `Font.getFontData` method, which affects its performance on certain platforms, such as Motif running on UTF-8. Additionally, the FontMetrics API is also heavily used. As a result, there is a need to optimize the usage of these methods in order to improve the overall performance of the StyledText.", "EB": "To optimize the performance of the StyledText widget, the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and only updated when the font is changed. This will help reduce the frequent calls to the `Font.getFontData` method. Additionally, considering the performance issue on platforms like Motif running on UTF-8, alternative approaches should be explored to minimize the impact of this issue.", "SR": "To investigate the performance issue with the `Font.getFontData` method, add a `System.out.println` statement at the beginning of the method `Font.getFontData`. Then, run a self-hosted eclipse and monitor the console. It is important to test this on platforms with poor performance, such as Motif running on UTF-8, to evaluate the impact of the issue on different environments."}
