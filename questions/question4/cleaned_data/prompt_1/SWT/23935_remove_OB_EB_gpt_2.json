  "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus",
  "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.",
  "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus and the text widget does not lose focus.",
  "EB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the expected behavior is that the tree gets focus, but the text widget should lose focus.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the application on Windows.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gets focus, but the text widget does not lose focus."
