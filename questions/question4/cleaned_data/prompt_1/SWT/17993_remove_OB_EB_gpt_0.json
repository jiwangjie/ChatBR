{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, if I type something in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field, it should not be automatically replaced with a value from the search history.", "EB": "Currently, when I type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the search history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Choose 'Edit -> Find/Replace...'\n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field again."}
