  "description": "The current error message for the Java application launch shortcut is not helpful to the user. Additionally, there is an opportunity to improve the overall quality of the error message.",
  "OB": "When attempting to launch the Java application, a dialog appears with the message: 'Launch failed: no main type found.' It would be beneficial to enhance the error reporting mechanism by considering the adoption of a resource selection approach similar to how external tools track selection for variable expansion. There is potential to consolidate these mechanisms into a single, more efficient mechanism.",
  "EB": "The error message displayed upon a failed Java application launch has been enhanced to provide more informative details, aiding users in understanding the issue. Additionally, the error reporting mechanism has been improved by implementing a unified approach to track resource selection, combining the existing mechanism for variable expansion.",
  "SR": "1. Enhance the error message for Java application launch failures to include more specific details about the nature of the issue.\n2. Investigate and implement a unified mechanism for tracking resource selection, with consideration for combining existing mechanisms related to variable expansion."
