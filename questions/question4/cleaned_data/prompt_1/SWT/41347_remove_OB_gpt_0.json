A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog dismissed just because the entry was selected. This behavior should be changed. The current behavior makes it difficult to differentiate between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo.", "OB": "The CCombo fires a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse from the dropdown list.", "EB": "The CCombo should fire a selection event instead of defaultSelection when an entry is selected using the mouse from the dropdown list. Default selection should only occur when hitting enter from the text field. This will align the behavior of CCombo with standard Combos.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse. The CCombo should fire a defaultSelection event, but standard Combos won't. This makes it difficult to distinguish between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo."}
