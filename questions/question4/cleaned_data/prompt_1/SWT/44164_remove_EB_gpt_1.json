  "OB": "The constructor for Image(Device, ImageData) can also throw org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Unsupported color depth. The bug report lacks details about the circumstances leading to this exception.",
  "EB": "The issue seems to be related to unsupported color depth when creating an Image object using the mentioned constructor. Further investigation is required to determine the specific conditions triggering this exception.",
  "SR": "Steps to recreate (note that the ImageData is successfully created, it is Image that is throwing the exception): import org.eclipse.swt.graphics. Ensure that the Image constructor is used with ImageData having a color depth supported by SWT. Additional information about the expected behavior of the constructor should be included in the Javadoc."
