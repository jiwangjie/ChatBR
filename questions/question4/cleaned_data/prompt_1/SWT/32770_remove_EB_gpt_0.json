Additionally, we need to improve the quality of the error message.", "OB": "When the user clicks on Debug As -> Java Application, a dialog appears with the message: 'Launch failed: no main type found'. We should enhance the error message and consider tracking resource selection similar to how external tools track selection for variable expansion. It would be beneficial to combine these mechanisms into a single solution.", "EB": "The error message displayed when the user clicks on Debug As -> Java Application should be more informative and suggest potential solutions for the 'no main type found' issue. The tracking of resource selection should be improved to assist in variable expansion during debugging.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Open a Java file containing a main method. \n2. Switch to a non-resource-based view, such as the Debug view. \n3. Click on Debug As -> Java Application."}
