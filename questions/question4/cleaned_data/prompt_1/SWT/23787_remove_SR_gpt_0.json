{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 [Properties dialog] Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "Integration build 09/17. The Project Properties Info page uses text fields which looks bad on all motif platforms. On Windows, it looks fine, but on motif platforms, these text fields get automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders and on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, they have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out and look bad.", "EB": "Instead of using text fields, the Project Properties Info page should use readonly Labels. This will prevent the automatic borders and different colored backgrounds. Currently, the text fields are likely used so that their values can be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": "Change the text fields in the Project Properties Info page to readonly Labels to improve the appearance on motif platforms and prevent the automatic borders and different colored backgrounds. Ensure that the values can still be selected and copied by the user if necessary."}
