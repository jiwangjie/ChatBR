  "OB": "When attempting to launch the Java application, a dialog appears with the message: 'Launch failed: no main type found.' We should improve this error message to offer more helpful information to the user.

Additionally, the consolidated mechanism for tracking resource selection and variable expansion should be implemented to enhance the overall user experience.",
  "SR": "1. Enhance the error message displayed during Java application launch to include specific details about the 'no main type found' issue and provide actionable suggestions for resolution.\n2. Investigate and implement a unified mechanism for tracking resource selection and variable expansion, optimizing the user experience during application development."
