However, when selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original. This is much slower than the close and reopen method.", "OB": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a file in the java editor.\n2. Make some changes to the file.\n3. Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n4. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4, and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.", "EB": "The 'Revert' operation should not take longer than closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "Investigate and fix the performance issue with the 'Revert' operation in the java editor to make it as fast as the close and reopen method."}
