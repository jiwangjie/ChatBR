{"id": "14047", "title": "Bug 14047 - StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap", "description": "The current bug report is missing a description. However, based on the provided information, the bug is related to the inefficient redraw of the StyledText component during text change with word wrap. The issue seems to be causing multiple redraws for each visible line, rather than a single redraw. To reproduce the bug, please follow the steps outlined in the 'Expected Behavior' section.", "OB": "The bug report is missing the 'Observation' section, but based on the description, the issue is that the StyledText component is experiencing inefficient redraws during text change with word wrap. It can be inferred that multiple redraws are occurring for each visible line instead of a single redraw.", "EB": "The expected behavior should be a maximum of one redraw for each visible line when the text is changed with word wrap enabled. To reproduce the bug, please follow the provided test case.", "SR": "To debug and investigate the redraws, you can add the following line to the 'performPaint' method of the StyledText class: System.out.println('lineCount ' + lineCount + ', paintY ' + paintY + ', renderHeight ' + renderHeight); This will print the values of 'lineCount', 'paintY', and 'renderHeight' and help identify the cause of the multiple redraws."}
