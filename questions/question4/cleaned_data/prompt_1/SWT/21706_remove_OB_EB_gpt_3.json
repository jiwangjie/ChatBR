  "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage",
  "OB": "Observed Behavior is that the current implementation of BidiUtil in win32 uses Class.forName() for Callback instantiation.",
  "EB": "Callback instantiation in BidiUtil should be done directly without using Class.forName().",
  "SR": "Change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);\nNote: This change hasn't been tested, but it is expected to produce the same result."
