Additionally, the quality of the error message needs improvement.", "OB": "When attempting to launch a Java application using a shortcut, a dialog appears with the following error message: 'Launch failed: no main type found'. This error message does not provide clear instructions on how to resolve the issue. It would be beneficial to track resource selection in a similar manner as external tools for variable expansion. This would allow for a unified mechanism.", "EB": "The error message should provide more specific guidance to the user on how to fix the problem. In this case, the user needs to select a resource. The improved error message should read: 'Launch failed: No file with a main type selected'.", "SR": "Enhance the error message for the Java application launch shortcut to provide clearer instructions to the user on how to resolve the issue. Specifically, update the message to state 'Launch failed: No file with a main type selected' when the user needs to select a resource."}
