{"id": "24877", "title": "Bug 24877: Cannot get file extension from SWT FileDialog", "description": "Bug 24877: Cannot get file extension from SWT FileDialog. It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "OB": "The current implementation of SWT FileDialog does not provide a way to retrieve the file extension selected by the user. It is necessary to have an API that returns the 'Save as type' field selected by the user in the FileDialog. This issue is particularly problematic when exporting to a jar file.", "EB": "When using the FileDialog, there should be an option to select the 'Save as type' field and enter a file name, for example, selecting '.zip' in the 'Save as type' field and entering a file name such as 'test'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open the FileDialog. 2. Select '.zip' in the 'Save as type' field. 3. Enter a file name (e.g. test)."}
