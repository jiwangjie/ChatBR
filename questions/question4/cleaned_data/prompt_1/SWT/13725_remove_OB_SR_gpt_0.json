{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor", "description": "When using the Java editor, performing a revert operation is significantly slower than closing and reopening the file. This behavior seems unexpected, as reverting the file contents should not take more time than simply closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "When performing a revert operation in the Java editor, it is observed that the operation takes much longer compared to the time taken for closing and reopening the file.", "EB": "It is expected that the revert operation in the Java editor should have similar or comparable execution time as the close and reopen operation. However, currently, the revert operation is significantly slower than the close and reopen operation.", "SR": "Investigate the cause of the slowdown in the revert operation and optimize it to bring the execution time closer to that of the close and reopen operation in the Java editor."}
