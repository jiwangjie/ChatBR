{"id": "45145", "title": "Bug 45145: Second window comes to front when using first", "description": "", "OB": "When switching from another application to an Eclipse window, and then clicking on a docked view or perspective, the other window comes to the front over windows of other applications. This behavior is not expected.", "EB": "The only time a window should come to the front is if I click on it explicitly, or if an action takes me to a widget in the other window. Clicking on the Eclipse dock icon should not be required to bring a window to the front.", "SR": "Ensure that windows in Eclipse do not automatically come to the front when clicking on docked views or perspectives. The expected behavior is that a window should come to the front only if it is clicked on explicitly or if an action takes the user to a widget in the other window."}
