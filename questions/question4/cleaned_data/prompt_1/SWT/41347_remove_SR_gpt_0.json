{"id": "41347", "title": "Bug 41347: CCombo fires defaultSelection on mouse list selection", "description": "When using the mouse to drop down the combo list and then selecting an entry using the mouse, the CCombo component inappropriately fires a defaultSelection event. This behavior is not expected and can lead to confusion for users. It is important to note that standard Combos do not exhibit this behavior. The current issue prevents distinguishing between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo. It is important for the CCombo to behave consistently and fire a selection event instead of a defaultSelection event in this scenario.", "OB": "The current behavior can be observed by dropping down the combo list using the mouse and selecting an entry using the mouse. The CCombo component will fire a defaultSelection event, unlike the behavior seen in standard Combos.", "EB": "In order to address this issue, the CCombo should fire a selection event instead of a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the dropdown using the mouse. A defaultSelection event should only be triggered when the user hits enter from the text field of the CCombo.", "SR": "Ensure that the CCombo component fires a selection event when an entry is selected from the dropdown using the mouse. Modify the event triggering mechanism to only fire a defaultSelection event when the user hits enter from the text field of the CCombo."}
