This makes it difficult to determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "OB": "When using the SWT FileDialog, there is no method or property available to get the selected file extension.", "EB": "The SWT FileDialog should have a method or property that allows retrieving the selected file extension.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open the FileDialog and select the '.zip' file type from the 'Save as type' dropdown. Then, enter a file name (e.g., 'test') without manually specifying the file extension. The dialog should not automatically append the '.zip' extension to the file name."}
