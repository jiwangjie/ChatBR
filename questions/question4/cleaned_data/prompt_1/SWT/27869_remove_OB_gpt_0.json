The FontMetrics API is also heavily used by the StyledText. I believe that the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and updated only when the font is changed.", "OB": "The Font.getFontData method is being used excessively by the StyledText, causing performance issues on certain platforms such as Motif running on UTF8.", "EB": "I believe, and many people agree, that the StyledText should not use the Font.getFontData API at all when text is being typed.", "SR": "To investigate the issue, try adding a system.out.println statement in the first line of the method Font.getFontData. Then run a self-hosted Eclipse and observe the console for any performance issues. I am particularly concerned about this problem because on some platforms the performance of this method is very poor compared to Windows. For example, Motif running on UTF8."}
