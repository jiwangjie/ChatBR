However, if I repeat steps 1) and 2), and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file's contents.", "OB": "Open a file in the Java editor, make some changes, and save it. Reopen the file by double-clicking on it in the file navigator without saving the changes. Note the quick response time for reopening the file without saving changes.", "EB": "When selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the Java editor, the time it takes to replace the contents of the window with the original file's contents is significantly slower compared to simply closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "Investigate the cause of the delay when using 'Revert' in the Java editor and optimize the process for faster execution."}
