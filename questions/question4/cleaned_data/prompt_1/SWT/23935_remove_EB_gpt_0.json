{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When the user clicks anywhere in the tree, the tree should gain focus. On Linux, however, the text widget does not lose focus when the tree is clicked. This issue is likely caused by the fact that the text widget is a child of the tree. As a result, platform UI bug 2470 is triggered.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, when the user clicks anywhere in the tree, the tree should properly gain focus. Additionally, on Linux, the text widget should lose focus when the tree is clicked."}
