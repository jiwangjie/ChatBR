{"id": "44164", "title": "Bug 44164 - Update needed in javadoc for constructor Image(Device , ImageData)", "description": "The javadoc for the constructor Image(Device , ImageData) needs to be updated. When using the constructor, an exception is thrown when attempting to create an Image even though the ImageData is successfully created. This can be observed in the provided code snippet. In the code, an ImageData object is created with dimensions of 10x10 and a PaletteData object. Then, an Image object is instantiated using the constructor Image(Device , ImageData), passing a Display object and the ImageData object. However, when calling image.dispose(), an exception is thrown.", "OB": "The current javadoc for the constructor Image(Device , ImageData) should mention that an exception may be thrown when attempting to create an Image using this constructor even if the ImageData is successfully created.", "EB": "The javadoc for the constructor Image(Device , ImageData) should be updated to clarify that an exception may be thrown when attempting to create an Image using this constructor. Developers should handle the exception appropriately.", "SR": "To recreate the issue, import org.eclipse.swt.graphics and follow the steps outlined in the provided code snippet."}
