{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "The bug report describes an issue with the usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class in win32. The problem is that the method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries, causing issues in the CLDC version of SWT. The reporter suggests removing the reflection usage by adding a private constructor to the class.", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 uses Class.forName() to create a Callback object, which can throw a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, I suggest adding a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in the class, this change would prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class and improve code clarity. Additionally, adding a private constructor does not increase the size of the compiled code.", "SR": "1. Add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class.\n2. Ensure that the private constructor is properly implemented to prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class."}
