  "description": "Bug 27869: StyledText overuse of Font.getFontData. By the way, UTF-8 is the default English encoding for Redhat 8. FontMetrics API is also heavily used by StyledText. I believe that the metric information should be cached in StyledText and updated only when the font is changed.",
  "OB": "When running Eclipse and using the Java Editor, a single keystroke can trigger the Font.getFontData() API to be called 13 times. This API is also excessively used during scrolling of StyledText and when selecting text. Each Font has 7 FontData, so every time a key, like 'a,' is typed in the Java Editor, 91 (713) FontData instances will be loaded.",
  "EB": "The current overuse of Font.getFontData results in unnecessary performance overhead and can lead to a slowdown in the Eclipse Java Editor. To optimize this, the FontMetrics information should be cached in StyledText and refreshed only upon changes in the font.",
  "SR": "1. Optimize the usage of Font.getFontData() in StyledText to reduce the number of calls during typical editor interactions.\n2. Implement a caching mechanism for FontMetrics information within StyledText to improve performance.\n3. Ensure that the cached metric information is updated only when there is a change in the font."
