The expected behavior is that pressing Enter/Return should perform a 'Find' operation, similar to clicking on the 'Find' button in the dialog. But in this case, nothing happens when the key is pressed.", "OB": "Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog does not perform a 'Find' operation on Mac OS X.", "EB": "Pressing the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog should trigger a 'Find' operation on Mac OS X.", "SR": "1.
