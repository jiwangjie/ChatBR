{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior is similar to autocomplete which is common in browsers. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the F1 build and accessing the Find/Replace dialog through Edit -> Find/Replace..., the history of recent searches is available. However, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous search entry is found, it replaces what has been typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, resulting in a change in the case of the typed entry to match the value from history. This behavior can prevent certain find or replace operations from being performed.", "EB": "For me, it is very common to perform find and replace operations like this. I believe the current behavior should be changed to something simpler that allows a full range of find and replace operations to be performed while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I suggest removing this feature. To reproduce the issue, open a document so that Edit -> Find/Replace... becomes available. However, you shouldn't be able to perform the find or replace operations as the typed entry will be replaced with a value from the history. The same behavior applies to the 'Replace With' field.", "SR": "Modify the behavior of the Find/Replace dialog to not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Allow a full range of find and replace operations to be performed while respecting the case of what the user types."}
