{"id": "42724", "title": "Bug 42724: StyledText selection rendered incorrectly on bidi platforms", "description": "The styled text selection is rendered incorrectly on bidi platforms. It appears that the entire selection background is being redrawn, but it seems unnecessary. There is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection, which should handle rendering. We should investigate this issue and find a more efficient solution.", "OB": "The entire selection background is being redrawn on bidi platforms.", "EB": "The drawLineSelectionBackground function should only be used to render the special line break selection.", "SR": "Build 20030903: The attached BidiUtil exposes a bug in the selection rendering code in DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground. Steps to reproduce: 1. Using the attached BidiUtil, type one English character followed by three or more Arabic/Hebrew characters. 2. Place the caret at the beginning of the line. 3. Select the next two characters, including one bidi character. 4. The selection background includes unselected characters."}
