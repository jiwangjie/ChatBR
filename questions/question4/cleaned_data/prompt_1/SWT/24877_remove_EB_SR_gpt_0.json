{"id": "24877", "title": "Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog", "description": "When using the swt FileDialog, there is no way to retrieve the file extension that the user selected. This makes the dialog almost unusable as we are unable to determine the correct file extension to append to the file name. This issue is particularly problematic when exporting to a jar file. It is essential that an API be added to the FileDialog to allow for retrieval of the 'Save as type' field selected by the user.", "OB": "There is no way to retrieve the file extension selected by the user in the swt FileDialog. This blocks us from determining the appropriate file extension to append to the file name, making the dialog almost unusable.

This will allow us to retrieve the file extension and append it to the file name. It is crucial to resolve this issue to enhance the usability of the FileDialog. The problem can be demonstrated when exporting to a jar file.", "SR": "Add a method to the swt FileDialog API that can retrieve the 'Save as type' field selected by the user. This method should return the file extension so that it can be used to determine the appropriate file name when saving files. Additionally, ensure that the fix addresses the issue when exporting to a jar file."}
