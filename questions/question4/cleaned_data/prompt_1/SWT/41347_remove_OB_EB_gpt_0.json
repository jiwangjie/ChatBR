{"id": "41347", "title": "Bug 41347: CCombo fires defaultSelection on mouse list selection", "description": "When using a CCombo, if you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the defaultSelection event is fired. This behavior is inconsistent with standard Combos and can be confusing for users. The expected behavior is that selecting an entry from the list with the mouse should not trigger the defaultSelection event.", "OB": "The OB statement is missing in the bug report.", "EB": "The CCombo should not fire the defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the combo list using the mouse. The behavior should be consistent with standard Combos.", "SR": "To fix this issue, the code for CCombo should be updated to prevent firing the defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the combo list using the mouse."}
