  "description": "Bug 42724StyledText selection rendered incorrectly on bidi platforms. I don't believe we even need to redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection.",
  "OB": "When forcing a redraw of the entire client area, the entire bidi segment is drawn with a selection background. The problem is that DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground includes code to redraw the entire selection background, and that code does not take bidi segments into account (direction runs). The proper selection background is, therefore, drawn in StyledTextRenderer.drawStyledLine, taking bidi segments and tab stops into account.",
  "EB": "The drawLineSelectionBackground should only be used to render the special line break selection.",
  "SR": "1. Open a document with bidirectional text on a platform with bidi support.\n2. Trigger a forced redraw of the entire client area.\n3. Observe that the entire bidi segment is drawn with a selection background, incorrectly.\n4. Expected behavior: The selection background should only be applied to the special line break selection.\n5. To reproduce: Avoid using drawLineSelectionBackground for bidi segments and ensure correct handling in StyledTextRenderer.drawStyledLine."
