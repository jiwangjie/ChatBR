{"id": "41347", "title": "Bug 41347: CCombo fires defaultSelection on mouse list selection", "description": "When using a CCombo, it should not fire the defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the dropdown list using the mouse. This behavior is inconsistent with standard Combos and can be confusing to users. The current behavior makes it difficult to distinguish between selecting an entry using the mouse and pressing Enter after typing in the text field of the CCombo.", "OB": "If you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event. However, standard Combos do not exhibit this behavior.", "EB": "The CCombo should not fire the defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse from the dropdown list.", "SR": "Fix the CCombo so that it does not fire the defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse from the dropdown list."}
