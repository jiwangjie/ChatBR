I don't believe we even need to redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection.", "OB": "When using the attached BidiUtil and typing one English character followed by three or more Arabic/Hebrew characters, placing the caret at the beginning of the line and selecting the next two characters (including one bidi character), the selection background includes unselected characters.", "EB": "The selection background should only include the selected characters and should not extend beyond them.", "SR": "Build 20030903: The attached BidiUtil exposes a bug in the selection rendering code in DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground."}
