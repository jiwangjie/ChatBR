I expected it to perform a 'Find' operation, similar to clicking on the 'Find' button. However, nothing happens when I press the Enter/Return key. This issue occurs after following these steps: 1) Open the Find/Replace dialog by selecting Edit -> Find/Replace. 2) Type a search term into the text box. 3) Press the Enter/Return key. The Enter/Return key should trigger a 'Find' operation as it is the default button in the Find/Replace dialog, but this is not the case.", "OB": "Hitting the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog should trigger a 'Find' operation.", "EB": "Pressing Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog does not perform a 'Find' operation.", "SR": "To fix this bug, the Enter/Return key should be configured to perform a 'Find' operation in the Find/Replace dialog as it is the default button."}
