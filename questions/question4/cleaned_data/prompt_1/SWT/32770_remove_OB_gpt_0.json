Additionally, we should improve the quality of the error message.", "OB": "When the user encounters a launch shortcut error while trying to debug a Java application, the error message does not provide any helpful information or hint about the possible solution.", "EB": "The error message should be enhanced to give the user a clear hint about what they need to do to fix the problem. For example, the message should say something like 'Launch failed: No file with a main type selected'.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open a Java file containing a main method.\n2. Select a non-resource-based view (such as the Debug view).\n3. Click 'Debug As' -> 'Java Application'.\n4. Observe the launch shortcut error message."}
