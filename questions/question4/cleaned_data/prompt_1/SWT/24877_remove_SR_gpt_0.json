{"id": "24877", "title": "Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog", "description": "When using the swt FileDialog, we are unable to retrieve the file extension selected by the user. This renders the dialog almost unusable since we cannot determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "OB": "Currently, there is no API available in the FileDialog to return the 'Save as type' field selected by the user. It is necessary for the FileDialog to provide a method to retrieve this information. Although we have encountered this issue in our own product, it can also be observed when exporting to a JAR file.", "EB": "The issue can be reproduced by following these steps: 1) Select a java file, 2) Select File > Export..., 3) Choose JAR file and click Next, 4) Click Browse... to open the Save As file dialog, 5) Enter 'test' for the file name, 6) Select '.zip' for the 'Save as type' field, 7) Click Save. As a result, the JAR export wizard uses 'test' for the JAR file field instead of 'test.zip'. The expected result is that the JAR export wizard should use 'test.zip' for the JAR file field.", "SR": "The FileDialog component should be updated to include an API that allows retrieving the 'Save as type' field selected by the user. Additionally, the JAR export wizard should be modified to appropriately handle file extensions when the user selects a file type in the Save As file dialog."}
