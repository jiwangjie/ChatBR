It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "OB": "When using the JAR export wizard and selecting a Java file, then selecting the JAR file option and clicking Next, a Save As file dialog appears. If we enter a file name without specifying the file extension and click Save, the JAR export wizard uses the entered file name without the correct .zip extension for the JAR file field.", "EB": "The JAR export wizard should automatically append the .zip extension to the file name when no file extension is specified in the Save As file dialog for the JAR file field.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1) Select a Java file. 2) Select File -> Export. 3) Select JAR file and click Next. 4) Press Browse to open the Save As file dialog. 5) Enter a file name (e.g., test) in the file name field. 6) Select .zip in the 'Save as type' field. 7) Click Save. The JAR export wizard should use the file name with the .zip extension (e.g., test.zip) for the JAR file field."}
