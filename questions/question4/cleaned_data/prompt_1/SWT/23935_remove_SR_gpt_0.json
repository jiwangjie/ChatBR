{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the Tree widget and the Text widget are children of the shell. The issue is specific to the Windows platform. A potential workaround is to create the Text editor as a sibling of the Tree and move it above the Tree in the widget hierarchy.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the Tree widget, the Tree gains focus. However, on Linux, the Text widget never loses focus when the Tree is clicked. This behavior is caused by the fact that the Text widget is a child of the Tree widget. This issue is also related to platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "Build 20020920: Run the attached code. On both Windows and Linux, the left Tree and Text widgets exhibit the expected behavior.", "SR": ""}
