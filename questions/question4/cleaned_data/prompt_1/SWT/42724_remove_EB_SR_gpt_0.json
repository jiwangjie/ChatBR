I don't believe we even need to redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection.", "OB": "On bidi platforms, when forcing a redraw of the entire client area, the entire bidi segment is drawn with a selection background. The problem is that DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground includes code to redraw the entire selection background, but this code does not take bidi segments into account (direction runs). The proper selection background should be drawn in StyledTextRenderer.drawStyledLine, considering bidi segments and tab stops.", "EB": "The selection background should only be redrawn for the affected bidi segments in StyledTextRenderer.drawStyledLine.", "SR": "Ensure that the selection background is properly drawn in StyledTextRenderer.drawStyledLine, considering bidi segments and tab stops."}
