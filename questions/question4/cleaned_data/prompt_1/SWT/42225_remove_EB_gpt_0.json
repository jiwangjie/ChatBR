{"id": "42225", "title": "Unable to assign command to Ctrl+Backspace", "description": "I am unable to assign a command to the Ctrl+Backspace key combination. When I try to do so via the key preference page, it displays Ctrl+Del instead of Ctrl+Backspace. I am using a Swiss German Keyboard with Swiss German Locale.", "OB": "The keybinding manager incorrectly identifies Ctrl+Backspace as Ctrl+Del and performs the delete next word action instead. This prevents the user from assigning any command to Ctrl+Backspace.", "EB": "The keybinding manager should correctly identify and display Ctrl+Backspace when the user tries to assign a command to it. Additionally, the assigned command should work as expected when the Ctrl+Backspace combination is triggered.", "SR": "The keybinding manager needs to be updated to properly recognize Ctrl+Backspace and allow the user to assign commands to it. The key preferences page should also display Ctrl+Backspace instead of Ctrl+Del when the user tries to assign a command."}
