  "description": "Bug 50016: Bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods. Created attachment 26089 [details] to improve division of responsibility for isUserInRole and login/logout methods. There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility. 1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.",
  "OB": "The current division of responsibility around Request.isUserInRole and the new Request login/logout methods is problematic. Specifically, the implementation of isUserInRole attempts to prevent JACC implementations and is incorrect. The roleref mappings are applied to the supplied role before testing the target role, contrary to JACC requirements.",
  "EB": "The division of responsibility should be improved to align with JACC specifications. The roleref mappings should be applied appropriately to ensure correct behavior, addressing the issues with the current isUserInRole implementation.",
  "SR": "Aside from the spec language, consider a web app with two roles, A and B, and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A."
