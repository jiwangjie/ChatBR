{"id": "50016", "title": "Bug 50016 - Bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods", "description": "Bug 50016 - There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility. When using the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. However, jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.", "OB": "The implementation of the new login and logout methods are excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. In particular, checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/pw login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed.", "EB": "The division of responsibility between isUserInRole and the new Request login and logout methods needs to be improved. The current implementation is causing issues with the roleref mappings and is not complying with jacc requirements.", "SR": "Consider a web app with two roles A and B and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A. The implementation should ensure that if the user is not in the mapped role, the original role is tested."}
