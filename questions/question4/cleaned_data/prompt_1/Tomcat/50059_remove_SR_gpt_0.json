Make a Servlet 3.0 webapp (let's name it \"foo\") with metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBINF/web.xml.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2.\n2. In the browser, go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\n\nExpected result:\n- A 200 response code and index.html is served.\n\nActual result:\n- A 404 response code is received.\n\nIf you modify the web.xml to metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the app, now /foo/index.html will respond as expected.\n\nI tried the same webapp with Glassfish v3.0.1 and it works as expected regardless of what I set in the metadatacomplete attribute.\n\nUpon examining the servlet 3.0 spec, it appears that metadatacomplete only regulates annotation and web fragment processing. In the example, \"bar.jar\" has nothing to do with annotations and it is not a web fragment either, but it is still handled differently depending on the metadatacomplete attribute.", "OB": "Based on the description provided, it seems that the bug can be reproduced by following these steps:\n1. Set up a Servlet 3.0 webapp named \"foo\" with metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute in the /WEB-INF/web.xml.\n2. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2.\n3. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\n\nExpected: The server responds with a 200 status code and serves the index.html file.\n\nActual: The server responds with a 404 status code.", "EB": "To reproduce the bug, a jar file named \"bar.jar\" should be placed in the /WEB-INF/lib directory.", "SR": "Investigate the issue with resources not being served from /WEB-INF/lib/{.jar}/META-INF/resources when metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in the web.xml file. Determine if this behavior is expected according to the servlet 3.0 specification or if it is a bug that needs to be fixed."}
