{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When running Tomcat with jsvc, the Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). This issue was observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 applied in r957960. The first instance starts successfully, but the second instance fails in Server.await(). The expected behavior is that the connector.init() call fails in StandardService.initInternal() because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() is caught there and, if EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown, caught in Catalina.load(), and then rethrown as an Error, aborting Tomcat startup.", "OB": "The issue occurs when running Tomcat with jsvc.
