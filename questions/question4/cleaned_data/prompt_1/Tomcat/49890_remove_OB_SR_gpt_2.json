  "description": "Bug 49890 - Nio Selector issue on Linux platform\nCreated attachment 25997 [details] NioEndpoint.java and simple web application.\nSometimes, the server's CPU reaches 100%, and stays at 100% until the server is restarted.\nReproduced with Java versions: 1.6.007, 1.6.018, 1.6.021.\nIt is a duplicate of issue: Bug 46373.\nIt seems that Jetty guys fixed that problem: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel.\nI added some logging to NioEndpoint.java.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is a server CPU reaching 100% utilization and persisting until a server restart is performed. This behavior is consistently reproducible with Java versions 1.6.007, 1.6.018, and 1.6.021. Additionally, the issue is identified as a duplicate of Bug 46373. The problem may have been addressed by Jetty developers, as indicated by the information at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel.",
  "EB": "To reproduce the JVM bug, it is necessary to perform several requests to the web application. This can be achieved, for example, by repeatedly pressing F5 in the browser or holding down the refresh button.",
  "SR": "The suggested resolution is to investigate and address the root cause of the Nio Selector issue on the Linux platform. Additionally, consider verifying whether the Jetty fix mentioned in http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel has been incorporated and is effective in resolving the observed behavior."
