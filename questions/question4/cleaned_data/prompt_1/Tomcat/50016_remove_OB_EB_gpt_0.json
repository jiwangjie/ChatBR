The Request.isUserInRole method tries to prevent jacc implementations and also behaves incorrectly. In the current Tomcat implementation, role ref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. However, jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a role ref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\n", "OB": "The current implementation of Request.isUserInRole method has a bad division of responsibility. It tries to prevent jacc implementations and behaves incorrectly.", "EB": "The division of responsibility in the Request.isUserInRole method needs improvement. It should not try to prevent jacc implementations and should behave correctly in all scenarios.", "SR": "Aside from the spec language, consider a web app with two roles: A and B, and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A."}
