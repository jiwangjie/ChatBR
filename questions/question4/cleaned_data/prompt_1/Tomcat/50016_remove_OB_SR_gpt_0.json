The method isUserInRole() in the Request class tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current Tomcat implementation, role ref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. However, jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a role ref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\n2. Both the isUserInRole() method and the new Request login() and logout() methods should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The Authenticator should also have the ability to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results.\n\n\nAttachments:\nAttachment 26089: Improve division of responsibility for isUserInRole and login/logout methods", "OB": "The division of responsibility around isUserInRole and the new Request login and logout methods is incorrect.", "EB": "The division of responsibility around isUserInRole and the new Request login and logout methods should be improved.", "SR": "1. In the isUserInRole() method, ensure that the method supplies the original role and, if possible, the servlet name to the wrapper. If there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked.\n2. Delegate both isUserInRole() method and the new Request login() and logout() methods to the Authenticator. Additionally, the Authenticator should have the option to cache the authentication results."}
