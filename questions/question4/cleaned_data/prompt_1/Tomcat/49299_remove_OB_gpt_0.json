{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name in Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1", "description": "The bug report states that in chapter 7.1.1 of Servlet 3.0, it is mentioned that a custom cookie name affects URL rewriting. However, the current behavior in the trunk does not follow this statement. The attached war file can reproduce this issue.", "OB": "The current behavior of the Servlet 3.0 implementation does not implement the functionality mentioned in chapter 7.1.1. The default 'jsessionid' cookie name is used instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "The expected result is that if the functionality mentioned in chapter 7.1.1 is implemented, the URL rewriting should include the custom cookie name. In the specific case of the attached war file, the expected URL for the Reload link would be 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Deploy the attached war file named 'cookiename.war'. 2. Access 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'. "}
