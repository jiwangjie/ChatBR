This issue has been reproduced with Java versions 1.6.007, 1.6.018, and 1.6.021.\n\nIt seems to be a duplicate of issue Bug 46373. It appears that the Jetty team has fixed that problem (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel).\n\nI have added some logging to the NioEndpoint.java file.", "OB": "The bug report does not provide sufficient information about the specific problem with the Nio selector on the Linux platform. It is also unclear what triggers the CPU usage to reach 100%.", "EB": "To reproduce the JVM bug, we should perform several requests to the web application and observe the CPU usage. It is suggested to press F5 in the browser and hold the button.", "SR": "This issue has not been observed on the Windows platform. Please find the following attachments:\n- NioEndpoint.7z: patched NioEndpoint.java file (with added logging)\n- web.7z: simple web application"}
