This issue has been reproduced with Java versions 1.6.007, 1.6.018, and 1.6.021. It appears to be a duplicate of issue Bug 46373. It seems that the Jetty team has fixed this problem (refer to http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel). I have added some logging to NioEndpoint.java.", "OB": "The server's CPU reaches 100% and stays at 100% until the server is restarted.", "EB": "The issue occurs when running the server on Linux platform. The server's CPU usage spikes to 100% and remains at that level until the server is restarted.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the server on a Linux platform with Java versions 1.6.007, 1.6.018, or 1.6.021. Monitor the server's CPU usage and observe that it reaches 100% and does not decrease until the server is restarted. The issue has been reported as a duplicate of Bug 46373, which has been fixed by the Jetty team. You can find details of the fix at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel. Additionally, I have attached the NioEndpoint.java file with added logging and a simple web application for reference."}
