{"id": "50059", "title": "Bug 50059 - Resources not served from /WEBINF/lib/{.jar}/METAINF/resources with metadatacomplete=true", "description": "Resources are not served from /WEBINF/lib/{.jar}/METAINF/resources if metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in web.xml.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a Servlet 3.0 web application named 'foo' with the metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEB-INF/web.xml file.\n2. The jar file (let's call it 'bar.jar') should be placed in /WEB-INF/lib directory.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- When the web application is started in Tomcat 7.0.2, accessing http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html should return a 200 response and serve the index.html file.\n\nActual behavior:\n- Accessing http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html returns a 404 response error.\n\nFurthermore, modifying the web.xml to set metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restarting the application resolves the issue, and /foo/index.html responds as expected.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that I tested the same web application with Glassfish v3.0.1, and it works as expected regardless of the value set in the metadatacomplete attribute.\n\nUpon reviewing the Servlet 3.0 specification, it seems that the metadatacomplete attribute only regulates annotation and web fragment processing."}
