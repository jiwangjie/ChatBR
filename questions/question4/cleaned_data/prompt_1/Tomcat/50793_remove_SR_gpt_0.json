{"id": "50793", "title": "Bug 50793 - Invalid DispatchType in ServletRequestListener on async dispatch", "description": "There is a bug in the ServletRequestListener where the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST rather than ASYNC after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch(). This bug occurs when a ServletRequestListener is defined and invoked after the async dispatch. The actual servlet is correctly invoked with the type set to ASYNC. If the listener is intended to be invoked for each dispatch, then the DispatcherType returned in the listener should match the value returned by the filter/servlet.", "OB": "The bug occurs when a ServletRequestListener is defined and invoked after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch(). The DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST instead of ASYNC.", "EB": "To fix this bug, the ServletRequestListener should return the correct DispatcherType, which is ASYNC, after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch().", "SR": "Fix the logic in the ServletRequestListener to return the correct DispatcherType, ASYNC, after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch() to ensure consistent behavior."}
