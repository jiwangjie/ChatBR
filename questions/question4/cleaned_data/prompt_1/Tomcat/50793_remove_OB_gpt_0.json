{"id": "50793", "title": "Bug 50793 - Invalid DispatchType in ServletRequestListener on async dispatch", "description": "When invoking the dispatch() method of AsyncContext in a ServletRequestListener, the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST instead of ASYNC.", "OB": "The expected behavior is that the DispatcherType should match the value returned in the filter/servlet.", "EB": "When the actual servlet is invoked, the type is correctly set to ASYNC. If the listener is intended to be invoked for each dispatch, then the DispatcherType should match the value returned in the filter/servlet.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, define a ServletRequestListener and invoke the AsyncContext.dispatch() method. After the invocation, check the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest and observe that it is REQUEST instead of ASYNC."}
