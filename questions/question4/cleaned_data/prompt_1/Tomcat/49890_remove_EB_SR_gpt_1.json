Reproduced with Java versions: 1.6.007, 1.6.018, 1.6.021. It is a duplicate of issue: Bug 46373. It seems that Jetty guys fixed that problem: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel. I added some logging to NioEndpoint.java.",

  "SR": "1. Analyze the NioEndpoint.java code to identify the root cause of selector.select(timeout) returning zero keys on Linux.\n2. Develop and test a fix to address the identified issue.\n3. Ensure that the server's CPU usage no longer reaches 100% due to this problem.\n4. Document the fix and update relevant documentation.\n5. Consider backporting the fix to affected Java versions, if applicable."
