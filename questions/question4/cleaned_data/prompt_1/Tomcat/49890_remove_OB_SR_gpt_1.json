  "description": "Bug 49890 - Nio Selector issue on Linux platform Created attachment 25997 [details] NioEndpoint.java and simple web application. Sometimes, the server's CPU reaches 100%, and stays at 100% all the time until restarting the server. Reproduced with Java versions: 1.6.007, 1.6.018, 1.6.021. It is a duplicate of issue: Bug 46373. It seems that Jetty guys fixed that problem: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel. I added some logging to NioEndpoint.java.",
