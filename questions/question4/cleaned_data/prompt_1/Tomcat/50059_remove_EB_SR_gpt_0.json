To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a Servlet 3.0 webapp named 'foo' with the metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBIBNF/web.xml.\n2. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2.\n3. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\n\nExpected Result: The server should respond with a 200 status code and serve the index.html file.\nActual Result: The server responds with a 404 status code.\n\nIf you modify the web.xml to set metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the app, accessing /foo/index.html will respond as expected. I have also tested the same webapp with Glassfish v3.0.1, and it works as expected regardless of the value set in the metadatacomplete attribute.\n\nUpon reviewing the Servlet 3.0 specification, it seems that metadatacomplete only regulates annotation and web fragment processing. However, in this case, the bar.jar file, which is neither an annotation nor a web fragment, is still handled differently depending on the metadatacomplete attribute.", "OB": "Start the 'foo' web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and access http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html in a browser.", "EB": "The server should respond with a 200 status code and serve the index.html file.", "SR": "Modify the web.xml file of the 'foo' web app to set metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the application.
