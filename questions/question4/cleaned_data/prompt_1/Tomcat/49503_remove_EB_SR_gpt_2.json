  "title": "Bug 49503 - Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()",
  "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully. When running with jsvc, it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. 3. Actual behaviour: The exception does not happen because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().",
  "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (80). The second instance fails to bind to the port as expected, leading to an unexpected behavior where the exception does not occur during the startup sequence.",
  "EB": "Connectors should bind to their ports during Catalina.load() and not delay the binding until the start() method is called. This behavior is crucial for proper functioning, especially when running with jsvc or when fixing issues related to bug 49030 + bug 48625.",
  "SR": "1. Start Tomcat with trunk at revision 957942. 2. Observe the issue when running with jsvc by testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 applied in r957960. 3. Note that the second instance fails to bind to the port as expected, leading to an unexpected behavior where the exception does not occur during the startup sequence."
