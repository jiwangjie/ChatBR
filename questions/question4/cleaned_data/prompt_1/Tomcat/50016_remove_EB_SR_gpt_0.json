{"id": "50016", "title": "Bug 50016: Bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods", "description": "There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility:\n\n1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent JACC (Java Authorization Contract for Containers) implementations and is also wrong. In the current Tomcat implementation, role reference (roleref) mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. JACC requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\n<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>\n1. Install Tomcat with a JACC implementation\n2. Use Request.isUserInRole method\n\n<b>Actual results:</b>\n- The implementation of the new login and logout methods are excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. In particular, checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/password login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed.", "OB": "The division of responsibility around the isUserInRole method needs to be improved. Currently, it tries to prevent JACC implementations, but this is incorrect. Additionally, the implementation of the new login and logout methods is excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication, which is restrictive and may not accommodate other authenticators that could be installed.", "EB": "The division of responsibility for isUserInRole method should be reviewed and revised to align with JACC requirements. The implementation of the new login and logout methods should also be refactored to avoid excessive intrusion into authentication internals and to support other potential authenticators.", "SR": "1. Review and revise the division of responsibility for the isUserInRole method to align with JACC requirements.\n2. Refactor the implementation of the new login and logout methods to avoid excessive intrusion into authentication internals and to support other potential authenticators."}
