  "OB": "Server's CPU usage reaches 100% and remains at 100% until server restart.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the server's CPU usage should not reach 100%, and normal operation should be maintained without the need for a server restart.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the JVM bug, perform the following steps:\n1. Send several requests to the web application (e.g., press F5 in the browser and hold the button).\n2. Observe the server's CPU usage reaching 100%."
