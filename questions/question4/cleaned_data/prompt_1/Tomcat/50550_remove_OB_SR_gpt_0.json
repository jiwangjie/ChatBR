There is a similarity with bug 21288, which was fixed and titled 'DirContext caching problem with Dreamweaver 6 when recursively creating directories'. The issue can be reproduced using a jackrabbit client. The steps to reproduce are as follows:\n\n1. Create an instance of HttpClient.\n2. Create a new directory URL with a unique identifier.\n3. Make a PropFind request to the new directory URL (comment out this request to make the second PropFind successful).\n4. Make a MkCol request to the new directory URL.\n5. Make a PropFind request to the new directory URL.", "OB": "The issue can be triggered by omitting the first PropFind request before the MkCol request.", "EB": "The workaround to trigger the issue is to omit the first PropFind request before the MkCol request.
