{"id": "50793", "title": "Bug 50793: Invalid DispatchType in ServletRequestListener on async dispatch", "description": "When a ServletRequestListener is defined, it is expected that when invoked after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch(), the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest should be ASYNC. However, in this case, the DispatcherType is incorrectly returned as REQUEST instead. This is a bug.", "OB": "After a call to AsyncContext.dispatch(), the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest should be ASYNC, but it is incorrectly returned as REQUEST.", "EB": "The DispatcherType should be returned as ASYNC instead of REQUEST after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch().", "SR": "Update the implementation of the ServletRequestListener to ensure that the correct DispatcherType, ASYNC, is returned after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch()."}
