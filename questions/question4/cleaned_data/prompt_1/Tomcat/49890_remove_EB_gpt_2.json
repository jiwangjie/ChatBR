  "description": "Bug 49890 - Nio Selector issue on Linux platform\nCreated attachment 25997 [details] - NioEndpoint.java and simple web application\nSometimes, the server's CPU reaches 100%, and stays at 100% until the server is restarted. Reproduced with Java versions: 1.6.007, 1.6.018, 1.6.021. It is a duplicate of issue: Bug 46373. It seems that Jetty guys fixed that problem: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel. I added some logging to NioEndpoint.java.",
  "OB": "With this logging, we can see that selector.select(timeout) sometimes returns zero keys on the Linux platform.",
  "EB": "The server's CPU should not reach 100% and remain at 100% indefinitely. The issue should not be reproduced on the Windows platform.",
  "SR": "1. Apply the attached patch to NioEndpoint.java (found in NioEndpoint.7z).\n2. Deploy the patched NioEndpoint.java.\n3. Use the provided simple web application (web.7z) to trigger server operations.\n4. Observe the server's CPU usage on a Linux platform, noting any instances where it reaches 100% and remains at 100%. Also, verify that the issue is not reproduced on a Windows platform."
