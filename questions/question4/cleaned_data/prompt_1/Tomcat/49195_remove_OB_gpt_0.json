{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port='1' in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When stopping the Tomcat service on Windows, if the server.xml file specifies <Server port='1', an error message is printed when the service is stopped.", "EB": "Instead of using sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), it would be better to use wait(10000), which can be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use the interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, e.g., by calling Catalina.stop()."}
