{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, the Tomcat service on Windows still functions correctly for shutting down, but it also prints an error message. This bug report suggests that there could be improvements in how Tomcat is stopped, as currently the System.exit(0) call is used regardless of the shutdown port configuration. The behavior of jsvc is also mentioned, but not tested.", "OB": "When shutting down Tomcat, the wait(10000) method should be used instead of the sleep(10000) method in StandardServer.await(). This change will allow the thread to be woken up by a notifyAll() call or using the interrupt() call if the specific thread is known.", "EB": "Instead of using the sleep(10000) method in StandardServer.await(), the wait(10000) method should be used.
