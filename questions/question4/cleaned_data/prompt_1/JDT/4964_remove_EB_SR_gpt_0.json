{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. I then type '('. But as soon as I type the '(', the automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected. I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The issue is observed in Build 204.", "EB": "The automatic code assist does not accurately predict the desired method 'dispose()' when '(' is typed after 'button.dispose'. Instead, it mistakenly inserts 'DISPOSED' as the suggestion, which is not the intended method invocation.", "SR": "The automatic code assist feature needs to be enhanced to accurately predict the desired method based on the context and prioritize suggestions that match the typed characters, such as 'dispose()', rather than unrelated suggestions like 'DISPOSED'. Additionally, the code assist should also be case sensitive in order to avoid incorrect suggestions."}
