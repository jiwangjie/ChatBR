If there is an open editor, all manipulations should just work on the working copy shown in the editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1) Open Java Browsing Perspective\n2) Select a type\n3) Select a method in the method list view\n4) Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view\n5) The editor becomes dirty (expected)\n6) Select another type\n7) Open type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view\n8) Select a method in the method list view\n9) Select the same method in the hierarchy view\n10) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view\n11) The method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared.\nNote: This issue does not occur when the editor is dirty."}
