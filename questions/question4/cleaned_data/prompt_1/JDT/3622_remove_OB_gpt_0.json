{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Package Wizard, a confusing message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message appears even if the package name field is empty. It is unclear what this message means and whether it indicates an error. Additionally, it is suggested that if this is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. During testing, it was found that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. It was also noted that the default package cannot be created by the user, as it is always present.", "OB": "When invoking the New Package Wizard, the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top, regardless of whether the package name field is empty or not.
