First, there is a duplicated name validation that should be performed on the first page. Second, the first and second columns should be merged.  Additionally, there are several other issues: the marking between the button and list is too large and the top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed as move up/down can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover. Lastly, when changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cutoff.", "OB": "Duplicated name validation is not performed on the first page.
