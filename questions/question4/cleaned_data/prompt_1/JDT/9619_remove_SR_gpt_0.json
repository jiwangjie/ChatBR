The existence of the type is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName.\nLabel could say 'Select destination type:'.\n\n<Bug Behavior>\n1. Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes).\n2. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\n3. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\n4. Destination type can be source type: Refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.\n\n<Expected Behavior>\n1. I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'.\n2.
