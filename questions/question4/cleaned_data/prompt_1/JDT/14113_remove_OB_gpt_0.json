This is incorrect as it should be firing a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta instead. As a result, the UI reacts by closing the class file editors that are open on the jar. However, when attempting to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not respond.", "OB": "Currently, when the attached source of a jar is changed, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired.", "EB": "When the attached source of a jar is changed, a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) java delta should be fired to update the class file editor. The FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH delta should be removed once this bug is fixed.", "SR": "To fix this bug, the code should be modified to correctly fire a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) java delta when the attached source of a jar is changed."}
