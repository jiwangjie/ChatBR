{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "20020521 (F1)(This may not be a debug PRI wasn't sure). So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.", "OB": "When a breakpoint is put in a Java file, right before a System.out.println statement, and the debug process is stepped into the println call (note that it may go into StringBuffer first, but that is not relevant), a Class File Editor opens. Clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow should scroll the editor, but it only scrolls one pixel at a time. Clicking on the scrollbar's background should scroll a page at a time, but it only scrolls about a line at a time. Grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll more naturally. When clicking on the arrows of the scrollbar, it should scroll one line at a time. Clicking on the scrollbar's background should scroll a page at a time. Currently, it only scrolls about a line at a time. However, grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.", "SR": "Modify the Class File Editor to enable scrolling one line at a time when clicking on the arrows of the scrollbar, and scrolling a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background."}
