{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist is not working properly", "description": "While writing SWT code, I typed 'button.dispose', and without realizing that the code assist list is up because I am not looking, I accepted the suggestion of 'DISPOSED' instead of the intended 'dispose()' method. This caused incorrect code to be inserted, forcing me to delete it and start over. The code assist feature should be smarter and automatically suggest the 'dispose()' method since it matches better than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, the code assist feature should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "The code assist feature is not working properly while typing SWT code.", "EB": "The code assist feature should be smarter and automatically suggest the 'dispose()' method instead of 'DISPOSED' when typing SWT code.", "SR": "Build 204"}
