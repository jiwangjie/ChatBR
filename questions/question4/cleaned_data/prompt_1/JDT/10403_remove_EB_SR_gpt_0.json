{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation confirmation needed for scrubbing bin directory", "description": "The bug report describes the need for confirming whether the output directory of a newly created project can be deleted and rebuilt. This confirmation should occur when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure. Currently, some users are creating projects and specifying the output folder to be a bin directory. However, this bin directory contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files. ", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and specifies the output folder to be a bin directory, we should present a confirmation dialog to ensure that the bin directory can be safely deleted and rebuilt. ", "EB": "Currently, there is no confirmation dialog when creating a new project with a bin directory as the output folder.", "SR": "Implement a confirmation dialog when creating a new project with a bin directory as the output folder to ensure that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt without any issues."}
