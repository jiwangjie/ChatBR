{"id": "17703", "title": "Bug 17703 - Edit/Add Task action should use Workbench dialog as Java Editor does", "description": "When executing the 'Add Task' action from the Java editor's ruler context menu, a different dialog is displayed compared to executing the action from the packages view. This inconsistency should be addressed by using the Workbench dialog for the 'Add Task' action in the same way as the Java Editor does.", "OB": "When executing the 'Add Task' action from the packages view, the same dialog as the one displayed when executing the action from the Java editor's ruler context menu should be shown.", "EB": "When executing the 'Add Task' action from the packages view or the Java editor's ruler context menu, the dialog should be consistent and use the Workbench dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the packages view.\n2. Select a CU.\n3. Right-click and select 'File' > 'Add Task'.\n4. Observe that the same dialog as the one shown when executing the action from the Java editor's ruler context menu is displayed."}
