Instead of firing a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta, it should trigger a FSOURCEATTACHED or FSOURCEDETACHED java delta. Currently, the UI reacts by closing the class file editors opened on the jar, which is the correct behavior for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when I tried to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI did not react as expected.", "OB": "When changing the attached source of a jar, the incorrect FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired instead of FSOURCEATTACHED or FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas.", "EB": "When changing the attached source of a jar, the correct behavior should be for a FSOURCEATTACHED or FSOURCEDETACHED java delta to be fired.", "SR": "The delta should be fixed to trigger a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta and the UI should react accordingly."}
