It should be 'Copy method 'void setUp()' FROM type 'TestCase'' (also with uppercase 'C' in 'Copy'). Another issue occurs when I select to delete the 'setUp' method from 'TestCase', I receive the message 'Delete method 'void setUp()' declared in type 'junit.framework.TestCase''.", "OB": "When performing the Pull Up operation, in the tree of changes, under the 'Assert' section, the message 'Copy method 'void setUp()' to type 'TestCase'' is displayed.
