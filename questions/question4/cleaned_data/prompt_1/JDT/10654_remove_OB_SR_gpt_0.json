{"id": "10654", "title": "Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jars to the build path in the current system, it is only possible to add individual jar files. It would be more efficient and convenient if there was an option to add all jars within a specific folder to the build path. This would simplify the process of managing dependencies and reduce the manual effort required to add multiple jars.", "OB": "Currently, only individual jar files can be added to the build path.", "EB": "It would be useful if a classpath variable could be used to specify a directory, so that all jar files within that directory are automatically added to the build path. This would be similar to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher, where the system property java.ext.dirs can be used to specify directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath. I encountered the need for this feature while using a class contained in the WebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0).", "SR": "Add the ability to specify a directory as a classpath variable, allowing all jar files within that directory to be automatically added to the build path."}
