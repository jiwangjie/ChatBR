{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up despite the cancellation request. This behavior is incorrect.", "EB": "The progress dialog should remain open if the operation is cancelled, and the exception list should not be displayed. Additionally, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the parameter for 'cancellable' should be set to false to disable the cancel button.", "SR": "Modify the implementation of adding an exception breakpoint so that it correctly handles the cancellation request. Update the ProgressMonitorDialog.run method to pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter to disable the cancel button."}
