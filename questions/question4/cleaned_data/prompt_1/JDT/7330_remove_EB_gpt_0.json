Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis, which is not clear to users. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view in order to access all the actions.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action needs to be available in the context menu.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be added to the context menu, so users can access it directly when selecting text.", "SR": "Ensure that all actions, including 'Add Javadoc Comment', can be accessed from the context menu or the Edit menu."}
