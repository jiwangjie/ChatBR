{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff. ", "OB": "Build 204 while writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the code assist list is displayed. However, I do not notice the list as I am not looking at the screen. The code assist list currently contains two options: DISPOSED and Widget. ", "EB": "Automatic code assist should be smarter in recognizing that when I type 'button.dispose(', it should suggest 'dispose()' as a more appropriate completion option than 'DISPOSED'. Additionally, the code assist behavior should take case into account when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "The code assist feature should be enhanced to accurately predict and suggest relevant completions based on the user's input. Specifically, when the user types 'button.dispose(', the code assist should prioritize suggesting 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'. Additionally, the code assist should take case sensitivity into consideration when automatically inserting suggestions."}
