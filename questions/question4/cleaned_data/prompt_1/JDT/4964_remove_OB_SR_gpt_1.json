  "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.",
  "OB": "The automatic code assist feature fails to recognize the context, resulting in incorrect suggestions. In this case, selecting 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()' when a '(' is typed.",
  "EB": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist should intelligently recognize context and prioritize suggestions. Specifically, when a '(' is typed, it should prioritize suggesting 'dispose()' over 'DISPOSED'. Additionally, consider implementing case sensitivity for more accurate suggestions.",
  "SR": "Improve the automatic code assist feature to enhance context awareness, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant suggestions. Priority should be given to methods that match the entered syntax, such as suggesting 'dispose()' when a '(' is detected. Consider implementing case sensitivity to further refine the suggestion accuracy."
