{"id": "16822", "title": "Bug 16822 - Search results not cleared when cu is moved", "description": "Build 200205211.", "OB": "When a Java compilation unit (cu) is moved between source folders in project P, the search results related to the cu should be automatically cleared from the search view.", "EB": "After moving a Java compilation unit X.java from 'P/src1' to 'P/src2', the search result for the declaration of X is not cleared from the search view.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project P with 2 source folders - 'src1' and 'src2'.\n2. Create a compilation unit X.java under 'P/src1'.\n   public class X {}\n3. Search for the declaration of X.\n4. Move X.java to 'P/src2'.\n   Observe that the search result is still present in the search view. \n   Additionally, an attempt to double-click on the search result opens a 'Search Error' dialog with the following message: \n   'An error occurred while creating a Java element.\n    Reason: X.java does not exist.'"}
