{"id": "11314", "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller", "description": "", "OB": "In the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (JavaWork in progress), when 'com.ibm.foobar' is replaced with 'co~.ib~.foobar', it can be observed that the package name compression is replacing a fragment even if the compressed name is not smaller. For example, 'com.' is not being replaced in this scenario, since 'co~.' has the same length and contains less information.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the preferences dialog in the JavaWork in progress.\n2. Navigate to the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field.\n3. Enter '2~.' in the input field.\n4. Observe that the replacement process does not consider the length and information content of the compressed name, and replaces fragments regardless."}
