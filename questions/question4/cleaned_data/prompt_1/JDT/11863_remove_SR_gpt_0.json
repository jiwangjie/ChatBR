The behavior should be improved to clearly indicate that selecting 'Y' will remove X.", "EB": "The 'Update' action should display the content of the existing Test Suite (directory, zip file) and allow modifications. Renaming the action and the dialog to 'Recreate Test Suite' would provide a clearer solution to the problem.", "SR": "Improve the behavior of the Update Test Suite action to clearly indicate that selecting 'Y' will remove X.
