{"id": "11866", "title": "Wrong labels in Update Test Suite dialog", "description": "The labels in the Update Test Suite dialog are incorrect. The label 'Test Classes to be included' is missing a space between 'Test' and 'Classes'. Additionally, the status line refers to methods being selected instead of types. Finally, the action name is written as 'TestSuite' instead of 'Test Suite'. These issues should be addressed and the labels should be corrected for clarity and consistency.", "OB": "The label 'Test Classes to be included' is missing a space between 'Test' and 'Classes'.", "EB": "The label 'Test Classes to be included' should be corrected as 'Test Classes to be included'.", "SR": "Update the label 'Test Classes to be included' to 'Test Classes to be included' for clarity and consistency."}
