{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation confirmation of scrubbing the bin directory", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or check done to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt successfully.", "EB": "The project creation process should include a confirmation or validation step that checks if the output directory (bin directory) can be scrubbed, i.e., deleted and rebuilt without any issues.", "SR": "To address this issue, when a user creates a new project and specifies an existing output directory, the system should perform a check to ensure that the directory can be safely deleted and rebuilt. This check should verify that the bin directory only contains .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files. If the bin directory contains additional files, a warning should be displayed to the user, suggesting that they choose a different output directory or clean up the existing bin directory before proceeding."}
