{"id": "10654", "title": "Bug 10654 - Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. This is causing inconvenience and manual effort for developers. Currently, I had to add several jar files from the WTE plugin directory to compile my code. I had to search through the jar files manually to find the missing classes and add the appropriate jars. I believe bug 3887 mentions a similar feature but is marked as deferred. I couldn't find any other bug report or feature request directly describing this issue.", "OB": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, developers have to specify each jar file separately, even if multiple jar files exist in the same directory.", "EB": "Allow adding all jars in a folder to the build path using classpath variables, eliminating the need to specify each jar file separately.", "SR": "Implement a feature that allows developers to easily add all jar files in a folder to the build path using classpath variables. This will save manual effort and make the development process more efficient."}
