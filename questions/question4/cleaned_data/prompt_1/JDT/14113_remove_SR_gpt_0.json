As a result, the UI closes the class file editors opened on this jar, which is expected behavior for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when attempting to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not react.", "OB": "Build 20020416 - Currently, when changing the attached source of a jar, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired instead of a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta.", "EB": "In this case, the class file editor should be refreshed to display the new source. For now, I will fire a (FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH | FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta and remove the FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH when this bug is fixed.", "SR": "Ensure that the UI reacts appropriately to the (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta and refreshes the class file editor to show the new source. Additionally, fix the bug so that a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH delta is not fired when changing the attached source of a jar."}
