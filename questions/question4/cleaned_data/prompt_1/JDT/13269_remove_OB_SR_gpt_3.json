  "description": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager. The same issue is observed for the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps, a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be more appropriate in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. 20020409. JRT.",
  "OB": "The bug report lacks details in the 'OB' section.",
  "EB": "Either way, not overwriting this file should not cause the wizard to not complete its operation. The 'use existing manifest from the workspace' option should not save a new manifest file.",
  "SR": "Provide detailed steps or scenarios that demonstrate the incorrect operation order in the jarpackager and the issue related to the '.jardesc' file. Include information on the expected behavior and any specific conditions necessary to reproduce the problem."
