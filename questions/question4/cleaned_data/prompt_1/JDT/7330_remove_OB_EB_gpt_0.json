Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference. This should be changed to make it clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. While not all actions need to be in the context menu, they should all be reachable from the editor. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu when selecting text.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu when selecting text.", "SR": "Ensure that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is accessible via the Edit menu when text is selected."}
