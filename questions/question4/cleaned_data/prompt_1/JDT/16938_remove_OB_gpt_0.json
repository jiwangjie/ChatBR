So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb. ", "OB": "The Class File Editor in the software does not scroll smoothly and does not respond correctly to user input.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll one line at a time when clicking on the arrows or click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time. Currently, the editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time. Grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Put a breakpoint in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement. 2. Debug to the breakpoint and step into the println call. 3. A Class File Editor opens. 4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow. The editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time. The editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time. Grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well."}
