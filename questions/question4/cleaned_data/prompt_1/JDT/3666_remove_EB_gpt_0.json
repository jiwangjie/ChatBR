{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 Code Completion: Hungry code assist (1GDRYW5)", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the IDE is eating too much code. This issue can be reproduced by following the steps below:\n\n1. Open the provided class.\n2. In the 'bar' method, add a parameter to the 'baz' call, so it becomes 'baz(x.foo(), )'.\n3. Place the cursor after the first 'x.', then press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist.\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list and select 'foo()'.\n\nThe expected behavior is that the code assist should provide 'baz(x.foo())', but it actually provides 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())'.", "OB": "When using the code assist feature after typing 'x.foo()', it should suggest 'baz(x.foo())', replacing the current code. Instead, it suggests 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())'. This behavior is incorrect.", "EB": "The code assist should suggest 'baz(x.foo())', replacing the current code in the 'bar' method.", "SR": "Change the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method to 'baz(x.x.foo())', place the cursor after the first 'x.', press Ctrl+Space, type 'f' to filter the list, and select 'foo()'."}
