  "description": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager. Same issue exists for '.jardesc' files. A suggestion is to display a warning in the wizard's header (since an icon is shown) for the '.jardesc' file instead of a dialog box at the end. If users desire that functionality, they should utilize the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. (20020409, JRT)",
  "OB": "The jar file is created before any overwrite verifications take place. Additional notes indicate that the message 'saving manifest file failed' may be incorrect in this context as the user opted not to overwrite the manifest file, making it not a true failure.",
  "EB": "The jarpackager operation should implement overwrite verifications prior to creating the jar file. Additionally, the error messages regarding failed manifest and description saving should be refined to accurately reflect user choices regarding file overwriting.",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1) Select specific packages and export as a jar.\n2) Choose 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3) Proceed by clicking 'Next'.\n4) Under 'Save description of this JAR in workspace', select a .jardesc file that already exists.\n5) Click 'Next'.\n6) Opt for 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and select a pre-existing manifest (easiest after running the wizard twice with preserved settings).\n7) Click 'Finish'.\n8) When prompted to overwrite the .jardesc file, choose 'NO'.\n9) Similarly, when prompted to overwrite the manifest file, choose 'NO'.\nNote: An error dialog appears indicating JAR creation failure due to manifest and description saving issues. Clicking 'Okay' returns to the wizard.\n10) Choose 'Cancel'.\nCheck the expected location of the .jar file to find that it was indeed created."
