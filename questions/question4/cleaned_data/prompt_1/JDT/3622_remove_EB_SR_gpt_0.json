{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has a confusing message", "description": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard, a confusing message appears at the top of the wizard before any input is provided in the package name field. The message states, 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message is unclear and ambiguous. It is not clear whether this message indicates an error or a warning. Additionally, the message should be displayed in red with an error icon if it is indeed an error. The package name field is initially empty when this message appears. It is important to clarify the meaning and purpose of this message and ensure it is displayed appropriately.\n\nNotes:\n- EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM): There should be no error message when the package name field is empty, and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.\n- MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM): It is a warning. I will remove the message.\n- EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM): The issue is how to create a default package. Currently, it can't be created by the user since it is always present.", "OB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard, a message indicating that a folder corresponding to the package name already exists appears at the top of the wizard, even when the package name field is empty.", "EB": "The 'New Java Package' wizard should not display a message stating that a folder corresponding to the package name already exists if the package name field is empty.
