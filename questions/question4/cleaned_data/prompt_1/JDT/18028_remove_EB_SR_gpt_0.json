{"id": "18028", "title": "Bug 18028: Rename package doesn't check if all resources are writeable", "description": "When attempting to rename a package that contains a CU, the system does not check if all resources (including the CU) are writeable. This results in an unexpected exception dialog after completing the renaming process.", "OB": "1. Create a package with a CU in it\n2. Make the CU readonly\n3. Attempt to rename the package\n\nObserved Behavior: After completing the renaming process, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "EB": "The system should check if all resources, including the CU, are writeable before allowing a package to be renamed. If any resource is readonly, the renaming process should be aborted and an appropriate error message should be displayed.", "SR": "Implement a validation check during the renaming process to ensure that all resources, including the CU, are writeable. If any resource is readonly, display an error message and prevent the renaming process from being completed."}
