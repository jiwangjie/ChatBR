{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has a confusing message", "description": "The New Package Wizard in the application displays a confusing message when the package name field is empty. The message says 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message appears at the top of the wizard before any input is entered. It is unclear what this message means and whether it indicates an error. Additionally, the message should be displayed in red with an error icon if it is indeed an error. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the New Java Package Wizard.\n2. Leave the package name field empty.\n3. Observe the message at the top of the wizard.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe message should not be displayed when the package name field is empty, and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.\n\nNotes:\n- EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM): There should be no error message when the package name field is empty, and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.\n- MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM): It is a warning. I will remove the message.\n- EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM): Issue: How to create a default package? It can't be created by the user since it is always there.", "OB": "When the package name field is empty, the New Package Wizard should not display a message saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.
