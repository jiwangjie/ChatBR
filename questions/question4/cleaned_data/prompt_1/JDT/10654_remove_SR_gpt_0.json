{"id": "10654", "title": "Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point to the whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to the build path. This would be analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher where you can specify the system property 'java.ext.dirs' to point to a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath. This feature suggested itself to me after using a class contained in the WebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0).", "OB": "Currently, when adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, it is necessary to specify each jar file separately, even if they are located in the same directory.", "EB": "It would be beneficial to introduce the ability to use a classpath variable to reference an entire directory, so that all jar files within that directory are automatically added to the build path. This functionality would be similar to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher, where the system property 'java.ext.dirs' can be utilized to specify a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically included in the classpath. This enhancement was inspired by my experience with the WebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0), which utilized a class that required multiple jar files from the same directory.", "SR": "Implement the ability to add all jar files in a specified directory to the build path when using classpath variables. This can be achieved by allowing the use of a classpath variable that references the directory, similar to the 'java.ext.dirs' system property for installed extensions. This improvement will enhance the user experience and streamline the process of adding multiple jar files from the same directory to the build path."}
