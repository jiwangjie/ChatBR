{"id": "4974", "title": "Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When attempting to set the output location and classpath in the IDE, an error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src' is displayed. This occurs because the current implementation treats setting output location and classpath as two separate operations, resulting in an illegal state when the first operation is performed.", "OB": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the IDE and navigate to the project settings.\n2. Attempt to set the output location and classpath at the same time.\n3. Click 'Ok' to apply the changes.\n4. The error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src' is displayed.", "EB": "The IDE should treat setting the output location and classpath as a single operation to ensure a valid state is maintained. When a user tries to set both the output location and classpath, the IDE should apply both changes simultaneously without creating any conflicts or errors.", "SR": "1. Modify the implementation to treat setting the output location and classpath as a single operation.\n2. Update the UI to allow users to set the output location and classpath together.\n3. Verify that the changes are applied correctly without causing any illegal states or conflicts."}
