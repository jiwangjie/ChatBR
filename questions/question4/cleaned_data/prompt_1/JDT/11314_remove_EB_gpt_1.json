  "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller",
  "description": "The 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress) is currently exhibiting unexpected behavior. When attempting to replace package name fragments, 'com.ibm.foobar' is replaced with 'co~.ib~.foobar'. It's expected that package name compression should only occur if the compressed name is smaller. In this case, 'com.' should not be replaced as 'co~.' is the same length and contains less information.",

  "EB": "The expected behavior is that package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. Thus, 'com.' should not be replaced in this example, since 'co~.' is the same length and contains less information.",
