{"id": "17618", "title": "Bug 17618: Changing output location should delete all derived resources", "description": "When the output location of a project is changed in an IDE, all derived resources should be deleted. However, currently, when the output folder is changed to 'project/bin', the class files are removed properly. But when the output folder is changed back to the original location, the class files are still removed, but the resources are not. Note that when opening the properties dialog for these resources, they are tagged as 'Derived'.", "OB": "When the output folder is changed for a project in the IDE to 'project/bin', all class files are correctly removed, but the derived resources are not deleted.", "EB": "When the output folder is changed back to the original location for the project, all resources, including the derived ones, should be deleted.", "SR": "1) Create a project with autobuild enabled. 2) Import Java sources and resources into the project. 3) Change the output folder to the 'project/bin' location. 4) Verify that all class files are removed. 5) Change the output folder back to the original location for the project. 6) Verify that all the resources, including the derived ones, are deleted.
