However, it should be possible to remove all derived resources, as long as they have been created by the Java builder.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1) Create a project with autobuild on.\n2) Import Java sources and resources.\n3) Change the output folder to 'project/bin'.\n    - At this point, all class files are removed, which is expected.\n4) Change the output folder back to the project folder.\n    - Again, all class files are removed, which is also expected.\n5) Open the 'project/bin' folder.\n    - Notice that all resources are still present in this location even though they should have been deleted.\n\nNote: When opening the properties dialog for these resources, they are tagged as 'Derived'."}
