{"id": "13269", "title": "Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager in the Eclipse IDE, there is an incorrect operation order that can occur. This issue also applies to '.jardesc' files. It would be better to show a warning in the wizard's header when using the '.jardesc' file, rather than displaying a dialog box at the end. To reproduce the issue, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Select some packages and export a jar file.\n2. Select 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3. Click 'Next'.\n4. In the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' option, choose a .jardesc file that already exists.\n5. Click 'Next'.\n6. Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest file that already exists. Note that this is easier if you run the wizard once and then run it again with the preserved settings.\n7. Click 'Finish'.\n8. A dialog box will appear asking if you want to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n9. Another dialog box will appear asking if you want to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\n10. An error dialog will appear stating that JAR creation failed, because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. Click 'OK' to return to the wizard.\n11. Choose 'Cancel'.\n12. Go to the location where your .jar file was supposed to be generated and observe that it was indeed created.\n\nThe incorrect operation order results in an error when saving the manifest and description to the workspace, causing the JAR creation to fail. This issue can be resolved by fixing the operation order in the jarpackager."}
