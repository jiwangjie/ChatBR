{"id": "11306", "title": "Bug 11306 - New class wizard launches simple project wizard", "description": "Since there are no existing projects, the dialog prompts the user to create a new project. This is very handy.", "OB": "When launching the New Class wizard and answering yes to create a new project, the resulting dialog displays the first page of the generic New Project wizard instead of the Java Project wizard. It should open the Java Project wizard.", "EB": "N/A", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a new workspace. 2. Switch to the Java perspective. 3. Press the 'New Class' button."}
