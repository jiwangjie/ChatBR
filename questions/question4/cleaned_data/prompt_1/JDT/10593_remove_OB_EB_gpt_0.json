{"id": "10593", "title": "Bug 10593: Jar export should add \".jar\" suffix if not specified", "description": "", "OB": "In Build 20020228, when selecting some files and exporting them using the jar export feature, if the user enters a name like \"test\" as the jar name, it creates a jar file called \"test\"", "EB": "The jar export feature should automatically add the \".jar\" suffix to the jar file name if it is not specified by the user. So, in the above scenario, it should create a jar file called \"test.jar\".", "SR": "Modify the jar export feature to append the \".jar\" suffix to the jar file name if it is not provided by the user during export."}
