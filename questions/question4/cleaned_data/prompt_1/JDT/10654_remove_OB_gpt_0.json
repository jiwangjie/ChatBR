{"id": "10654", "title": "Bug 10654: Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. This process becomes cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when there are multiple jar files in a directory. It would be much more convenient if there was a feature to allow adding all jar files in a folder to the build path by using a classpath variable. This feature would be similar to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher, where you can specify the system property java.ext.dirs to point to a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath. The need for this feature arose after using a class contained in the WebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0).", "OB": "Currently, when adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, each jar file needs to be specified separately. This manual process is time-consuming and inconvenient.", "EB": "The suggested improvement is to allow all jar files in a folder to be added to the build path by using a classpath variable. This would eliminate the need to specify each jar file separately and make the process more efficient and user-friendly.", "SR": "Implement a feature that allows users to use a classpath variable to point to a directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to the build path automatically. This feature should function similar to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher, where the system property java.ext.dirs can be used to specify a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath."}
