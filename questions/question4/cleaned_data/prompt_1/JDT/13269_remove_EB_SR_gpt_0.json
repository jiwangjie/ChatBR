{"id": "13269", "title": "Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager in the IDE, there is an issue with the operation order. The same issue also occurs when using the '.jardesc' file. It would be better to show a warning in the wizard's header (along with the icon) instead of displaying a dialog box at the end. Alternatively, the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option in combination with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option could be used. This bug was observed on 20020409 by JRT.", "OB": "The jar file is created before the overwrite verifications take place. Additionally, the message 'saving manifest file failed' is incorrect in this case because the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file, so it should not be considered a failure.", "EB": "The operation order in the jarpackager wizard and when using the '.jardesc' file should be fixed to ensure proper behavior. Instead of displaying a dialog box at the end, a warning should be shown in the wizard's header. Additionally, the message 'saving manifest file failed' should be adjusted to reflect the user's choice regarding overwriting the manifest file.", "SR": "Investigate the operation order in the jarpackager and the handling of overwrite verifications. Adjust the behavior to ensure the jar file is created after the verifications. Update the message 'saving manifest file failed' to provide accurate information based on the user's choice regarding overwriting the manifest file."}
