This inconsistency can confuse users and make the task creation process less intuitive. The application should update the Edit/Add Task action to use the same Workbench dialog as the Java Editor for a consistent user experience.", "OB": "Currently, the Edit/Add Task action in the application uses a different dialog than the one used by the Java Editor.", "EB": "The Edit/Add Task action should use the Workbench dialog, similar to how the Java Editor does.", "SR": "Update the Edit/Add Task action to use the Workbench dialog, ensuring consistency with the Java Editor."}
