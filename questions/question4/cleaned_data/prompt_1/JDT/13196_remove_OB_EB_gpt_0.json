When performing the following steps:", "OB": "1. Open the Java Browsing Perspective.\n2. Select a type.\n3. Select a method in the method list view.\n4. Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view.\n5. The editor becomes dirty (which is expected).\n6. Select another type.\n7. Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view.\n8. Select a method in the method list view.\n9. Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n10. Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view.\n11. The method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when deleting a method in the hierarchy view, it should behave the same way as when deleting a method in the method list view. That is, the method should be deleted from the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor should all be cleared.", "SR": "The issue occurs when deleting a method from the hierarchy view, and it does not match the behavior of deleting a method from the method list view. The expected behavior is for the method to be deleted from the file system, and for the type list view, method list view, and editor to be cleared as well."}
