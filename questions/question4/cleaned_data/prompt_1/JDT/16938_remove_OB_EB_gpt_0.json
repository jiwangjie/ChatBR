{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "20020521 (F1)(This may not be a debug PRI wasn't sure). So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.", "OB": "When using the scrollbar's down arrow to scroll in the Class File Editor, the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. When clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll, the editor only scrolls about a line at a time instead of scrolling a page at a time.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll more naturally when using the scrollbar. Scrolling with the thumb should not be the only efficient way to scroll through the editor.", "SR": "Investigate and fix the issue causing the Class File Editor to scroll improperly when using the scrollbar's down arrow and background. The editor should scroll smoothly, allowing users to scroll a whole page at a time using the scrollbar's background, and scroll multiple pixels at a time using the scrollbar's down arrow."}
