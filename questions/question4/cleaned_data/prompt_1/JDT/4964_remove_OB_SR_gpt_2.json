  "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter",
  "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.",
  "OB": "When using the automatic code assist, the suggested completion for 'DISPOSED' is inserted as 'button.DISPOSED' instead of the expected 'dispose()'.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the automatic code assist should recognize the context of the open parenthesis and suggest 'dispose()' as a more relevant completion, considering the user's input.",
  "SR": "1. Open a code editor and start typing 'button.DISPOSED('.\n2. Observe the incorrect suggestion.\n3. Expected behavior is for the code assist to recognize the open parenthesis and suggest 'dispose()' instead."
