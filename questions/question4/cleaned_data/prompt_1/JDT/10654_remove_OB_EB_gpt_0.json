{"id": "10654", "title": "Bug 10654: Unable to add multiple jars in a folder to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, it is not possible to add multiple jars in a folder at once. Each jar file needs to be added separately, even if they are located in the same directory. This issue requires manual searching and addition of jar files to ensure all necessary classes are included in the build path. This problem is related to bug 3887, which suggests a deferred feature for adding multiple jars in a folder to the build path. However, no direct bug report or feature request addressing this problem has been found.", "OB": "Currently, it is not possible to add multiple jars in a folder to the build path using classpath variables. Each jar file needs to be added separately.", "EB": "The ability to add multiple jars in a folder to the build path using classpath variables should be implemented.", "SR": "1. Allow users to select and add multiple jars in a folder to the build path using classpath variables.\n2. Ensure all classes from the selected jar files are included in the build path automatically.\n3. Test the feature thoroughly to ensure it works as expected."}
