{"id": "13196", "title": "Unexpected behavioral difference when manipulating source in the Java Browsing Perspective", "description": "There is an unexpected behavioral difference when manipulating source in the Java Browsing Perspective. When performing certain actions, such as deleting a method, the expected behavior does not occur.", "OB": "From the user's perspective, the issue can be reproduced by following these steps:\n\n1. Open the Java Browsing Perspective.\n2. Select a type.\n3. Select a method in the method list view.\n4. Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view.\n     - The editor becomes dirty (which is expected).\n5. Select another type.\n6. Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7. Select a method in the method list view.\n8. Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9. Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view.\n     - The method is deleted on the file system.\n     - Type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared.\n\nNote: This issue does not occur when the editor is dirty.", "EB": "The unexpected behavioral difference is observed when performing the described actions in the Java Browsing Perspective. In step 9, the method is unexpectedly deleted on the file system, as well as in the type list view, method list view, and editor. This behavior is not consistent with the behavior when the editor is dirty.", "SR": "The desired resolution of this bug is to have consistent behavior when manipulating source in the Java Browsing Perspective. The method should not be deleted on the file system or cleared from the type list view, method list view, and editor when performing the described actions. The behavior should be the same regardless of whether the editor is dirty."}
