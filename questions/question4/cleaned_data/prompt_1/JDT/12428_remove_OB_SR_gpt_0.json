    "description": "Bug 12428: Pull Up - Confusing message\n\nThe current message is not clear. It should be 'Copy method 'void setUp()' FROM type 'TestCase' (also with uppercase C in Copy).\n\nAnother issue is that if I select to delete setUp from TestCase, I get the message \"Delete method 'void setUp()' declared in type 'junit.framework.TestCase'\" under TestCase.\n\nMarkus suggests that the 'copy method' text should be consistent and also use the fully qualified name.",
