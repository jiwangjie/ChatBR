I don't fully understand it.", "OB": "When I try to view the class hierarchies of the internal jars by selecting 'org.apache.ant' in the scoped type hierarchy (org.apache.ant), I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, can you explain the meaning of this message?", "EB": "When I try to view the class hierarchies of the internal jars by selecting 'org.apache.ant' in the scoped type hierarchy, I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.
