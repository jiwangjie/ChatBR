  "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation confirmation for scrubbing bin directory",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory, which contains more than just .class files. These additional files can be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "EB": "Upon project creation for an existing directory structure, the system should provide confirmation that the output directory can be deleted and subsequently rebuilt. This confirmation is essential to address scenarios where users create projects and set the output folder to a bin directory, which may contain files beyond .class files. The rebuild process should encompass the reconstruction of all necessary files from the available .java files.",
  "SR": "Ensure that, when users create a new project for an existing directory structure, there is a confirmation mechanism in place. This confirmation should validate the feasibility of deleting and rebuilding the output directory. It is crucial to accommodate users who create projects with the output folder directed towards a bin directory containing more than just .class files. The rebuilding process should be capable of reconstructing all relevant files from the available .java files."
