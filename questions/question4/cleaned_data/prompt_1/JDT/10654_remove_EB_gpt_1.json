  "title": "Bug 10654 - Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path",
  "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory.",
  "OB": "The current behavior requires users to individually specify each jar file when adding them to the build path using classpath variables. This becomes cumbersome, especially when dealing with multiple jar files located in the same directory.",
  "EB": "I encountered difficulties compiling my code due to the need to manually add several jar files from the WTE plugin directory. This involved searching through the jar files to identify missing classes and adding the appropriate jars. It seems related to bug 3887, which suggests a similar feature might be deferred. However, I couldn't find a direct bug report or feature request describing this issue.",
  "SR": "Enable the ability to add all jar files within a specific folder to the build path simultaneously when using classpath variables. This enhancement would streamline the process, eliminating the need to specify each jar file individually."
