Perhaps displaying a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown) would be more appropriate for the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user desires this behavior, they should utilize the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. 20020409. JRT.",

In 'Save description of this JAR in workspace', select a .jardesc file that already exists.\n5. Click 'Next'.\n6. Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest that already exists (easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with preserved settings).\n7. Click 'Finish'.\n8. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n9. Another dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'. Note that an error dialog appears, stating JAR creation failed, because saving manifest to the workspace and saving the description to the workspace failed. If you click 'OK', you will return to the wizard.\n10. Choose 'Cancel'.\n11. Go to where your .jar file was supposed to be generated and note that it was indeed created."
