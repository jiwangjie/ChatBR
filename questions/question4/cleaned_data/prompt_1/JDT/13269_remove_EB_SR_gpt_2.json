  "description": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager. The same issue occurs for the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header, now that an icon is shown, would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. (Reported on 20020409 by JRT.)",
  "OB": "The jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen. Other notes: the message 'saving manifest file failed' is perhaps incorrect in this case, as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file (thus it is not really a failure).",
  "EB": "The jar file creation process should take into account overwrite verifications before completion. Additionally, reevaluate the wording of the 'saving manifest file failed' message to accurately reflect the user's choice not to overwrite.",
  "SR": "1. Open the jarpackager wizard.\n2. Select a '.jardesc' file for packaging.\n3. Proceed with the packaging process without overwriting the manifest file.\n4. Observe the 'saving manifest file failed' message and the order of operations."
