{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation confirmation for scrubbing bin directory", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure with the output folder set to a bin directory, we should display a confirmation dialog to ensure that the user intends to delete the existing bin directory and rebuild it.", "EB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and sets the output folder to a non-empty bin directory, there is no confirmation or warning message displayed. The bin directory is overwritten without any acknowledgement from the user.", "SR": "To fix this issue, we need to modify the project creation process to include a confirmation dialog when the user selects a bin directory as the output folder. The dialog should clearly state that the existing bin directory will be deleted and rebuilt. The user should have the option to confirm or cancel the action. If the user confirms, the bin directory should be deleted and recreated as part of the project creation process, ensuring that only the necessary .class files are present."}
