{"id": "18163", "title": "Bug 18163 - Add Import should ignore leading/trailing whitespace", "description": "When attempting to use the Ctrl+M (Add Import) shortcut, nothing happens if there is trailing whitespace within the selection. This is because the feature does not currently support the presence of whitespace. For example, when making a selection using Shift + Ctrl + Right, the resulting text contains an additional space at the end, causing the Add Import feature to fail. The expected behavior should be that the feature ignores any leading or trailing whitespace within the selection.", "OB": "When I tried to use the Ctrl+M (Add Import) shortcut, nothing happened because of the trailing whitespace within the selection.", "EB": "Instead of adding the desired import statement for 'Node', it added 'Node ' (with an extra space) because I made my selection using 'Shift + Ctrl + Right'.", "SR": "The Add Import feature should be modified to ignore any leading or trailing whitespace within the selection, as this can cause it to fail and add incorrect import statements."}
