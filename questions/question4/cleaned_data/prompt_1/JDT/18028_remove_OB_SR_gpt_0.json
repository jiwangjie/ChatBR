{"id": "18028", "title": "Bug 18028 - Rename package doesn't check if all resources are writeable", "description": "When attempting to rename a package, the current implementation does not check if all resources (files) within the package are writeable. As a result, the renaming operation may fail or produce inconsistent results if any of the resources are not writeable. This bug report aims to address this issue by adding a precondition check to ensure all resources are writeable before renaming the package.", "OB": "Currently, when renaming a package, there is no check in place to verify if all resources are writeable.", "EB": "After the fix, the package renaming process should include a step to check and ensure that all resources within the package are writeable.", "SR": "To fix this bug, add a precondition check before renaming a package. This check should verify if all resources (files) within the package are writeable. If any resource is not writeable, the renaming process should either fail or prompt the user to make the resource writeable before proceeding with the renaming operation."}
