{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "20020521 (F1)(This may not be a debug PRI wasn't sure). So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.", "OB": "When a breakpoint is set in a java file and the debugger is stepped into a System.out.println statement (in this case, stepped into the StringBuffer first), a Class File Editor opens. Clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow only scrolls one pixel at a time. Clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time only scrolls about a line at a time instead of scrolling a full page. However, grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll more naturally when using the scrollbar's arrows and background to ensure a smoother scrolling experience.", "SR": "Investigate and modify the Class File Editor's scrolling behavior to scroll more naturally when using the scrollbar's arrows and background. Test the modified behavior to ensure it provides a smoother scrolling experience."}
