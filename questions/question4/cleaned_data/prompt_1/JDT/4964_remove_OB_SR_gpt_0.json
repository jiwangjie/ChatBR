{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Code assist should prioritize matching method names over matching variable names.", "EB": "The current implementation of the Code Assist feature does not prioritize matching method names when inserting code automatically. As a result, in this specific scenario, when the user types a '(' after an object name, the code assist mistakenly suggests a variable name instead of a method name.", "SR": "Update the Code Assist feature to prioritize matching method names over variable names when automatically inserting code snippets."}
