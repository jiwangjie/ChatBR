Note: This is not the case when the editor is dirty.",
  "EB": "The unexpected behavioral difference described above should not occur. The editor's state and the consistency of method deletion across views need to be addressed and fixed.",
  "SR": "Ensure consistent behavior when manipulating source in the type hierarchy and the method list of the browser perspective. Verify that deleting a method updates the editor's state and maintains consistency across file system, type list view, method list view, and editor.
