Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing a for loop statement.\n3. Use code assist to automatically generate the for loop with a temporary variable.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code assist feature should respect the platform line ends and generate code with the appropriate line endings (CRLF on Windows).", "SR": "To fix this issue, the following steps can be taken:\n1. Investigate the code assist feature to identify the cause of the incorrect line endings.\n2. Update the code assist functionality to correctly respect the platform line ends and generate code with the appropriate line endings based on the user's operating system."}
