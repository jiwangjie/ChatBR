{"id": "13269", "title": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager in the Eclipse IDE, there is an incorrect operation order. In the same case for '.jardesc' file, a warning in the wizard's header would be better than a dialog box at the end. Currently, the jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen. This causes the message 'saving manifest file failed' to be displayed, which is incorrect as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file. A better approach would be to show a warning message instead. 20020409. JRT.", "OB": "The incorrect operation order in the jarpackager results in the jar file being created before the overwrite verifications occur. This causes the 'saving manifest file failed' message to be displayed, even though the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n\n1. Select some packages and export jar file. \n2. Select 'Export java source files and resources'. \n3. Click Next. \n4. In the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' option, choose a .jardesc file that already exists. \n5. Click Next. \n6. Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest file that already exists (you can run the wizard once and then again with the preserved settings to make this step easier). \n7. Click Finish. \n8. A dialog will appear asking if you want to overwrite the .jardesc file. Choose NO. \n9. Another dialog will appear asking if you want to overwrite the manifest file. Choose NO. \n10. An error dialog will appear saying JAR creation failed, because saving the manifest to the workspace and saving the description to the workspace both failed. Click OK. \n11. Choose Cancel. \n12. Navigate to the location where the .jar file should have been generated and observe that it was actually created."}
