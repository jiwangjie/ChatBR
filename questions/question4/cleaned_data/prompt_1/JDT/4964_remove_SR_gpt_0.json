{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "Bug 4964: The Automatic Code Assist feature should take into account the context and prioritize the suggestions based on relevance. Currently, when typing 'button.dispose', if the code assist list is displayed and 'DISPOSED' is the first suggestion, it is automatically inserted when I type '('. However, 'dispose()' is a more relevant suggestion in this case and it should be prioritized. Additionally, the code assist feature should consider case sensitivity when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "Update the Automatic Code Assist feature to improve suggestion prioritization based on relevance. When the user types 'button.dispose', if the code assist list is displayed and 'DISPOSED' is the first suggestion, it should not be automatically inserted when the user types '('. Instead, 'dispose()' should be prioritized as a more relevant suggestion. Additionally, make the code assist feature case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions."}
