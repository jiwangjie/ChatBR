{"id": "14113", "title": "Bug 14113: Should listen to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas", "description": "When changing the attached source of a jar, currently a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired instead of a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta. This incorrect behavior causes the UI to close class file editors, which is expected for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH delta. However, when attempting to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not react.", "OB": "In the current build 20020416, changing the attached source of a jar triggers the firing of a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta, instead of a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta. This leads to the UI closing class file editors on the affected jar.", "EB": "The delta should be modified to correctly fire a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta when changing the attached source of a jar, ensuring that the UI reacts appropriately.", "SR": "Investigate and fix the issue causing the incorrect firing of the FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH delta when changing the attached source of a jar. Modify the delta to correctly fire a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta. Verify that the UI reacts as expected by not closing class file editors when the (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta is fired."}
