{"id": "13269", "title": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "When using the jarpackager in Eclipse, there is an incorrect operation order. The same issue also occurs with the '.jardesc' file. It would be better to display a warning in the wizard's header, rather than a dialog box at the end, especially for the '.jardesc' file. Additionally, if the user wants to include the manifest in the workspace, they should select the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option along with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option.", "OB": "The jarpackager operation order is incorrect. The '.jardesc' file is not being handled properly.", "EB": "The operation order in the jarpackager should be corrected. The handling of the '.jardesc' file needs improvement. A warning should be displayed in the wizard's header for the '.jardesc' file. The options for saving the manifest in the workspace should be clarified to avoid confusion.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue: 1) Select some packages and export as a jar file. 2) Check the 'Export java source files and resources' option. 3) Click Next. 4) In the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' option, select a .jardesc file that already exists. 5) Click Next. 6) Select the 'Use existing manifest from workspace' option and choose a manifest that already exists. (You can run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings to make this step easier.) 7) Click Finish. 8) A dialog will appear asking if you want to overwrite the .jardesc file. Choose NO. 9) A dialog will appear asking if you want to overwrite the manifest file. Choose NO. Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed because saving the manifest to the workspace and saving the description to the workspace failed. Click Okay to return to the wizard. 10) Choose Cancel. Go to the location where the .jar file was supposed to be generated and confirm that it was indeed created."}
