  "description": "The Update Test Suite dialog displays incorrect labels.",
  "OB": "The label 'TestClasses' lacks a space, appearing as 'TestClasses' instead of 'Test Classes'. The status line refers to methods being selected rather than types. The action name 'TestSuite' is concatenated without a space, appearing as 'TestSuite' instead of 'Test Suite'.",
  "EB": "The label 'TestClasses' should be corrected to 'Test Classes' to include a space. The status line should mention types being selected instead of methods. The action name 'TestSuite' should be written as 'Test Suite' with a space between the words.",
  "SR": "1. Open the 'Update Test Suite' dialog. 2. Observe the label 'TestClasses' missing a space. 3. Check the status line for mention of methods instead of types. 4. Look for the action name 'TestSuite' written without a space."
