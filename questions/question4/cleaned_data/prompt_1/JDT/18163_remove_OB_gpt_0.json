{"id": "18163", "title": "Bug 18163 - Add Import should ignore leading/trailing whitespace", "description": "When using the 'Add Import' function in the code editor, it does not work when there is leading or trailing whitespace in the selected text. ", "OB": "The 'Add Import' function should work regardless of any leading or trailing whitespace in the selected text. ", "EB": "When I made a selection using 'Shift + Ctrl + Right' and then tried to use 'Add Import', instead of importing the selected text 'Node', the function imported 'Node ' (with a trailing whitespace).", "SR": "The 'Add Import' function should ignore leading and trailing whitespace in the selected text and import only the desired text. This will prevent cases where the function fails to work due to the presence of whitespace within the selection."}
