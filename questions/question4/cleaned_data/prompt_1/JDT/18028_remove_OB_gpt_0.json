{"id": "18028", "title": "Bug 18028: Rename package doesn't check if all resources are writeable", "description": "When attempting to rename a package, the system doesn't check if all resources within the package are writeable. This can lead to unexpected exceptions during the renaming process.", "OB": "The current implementation of package renaming does not verify the write permissions for all resources contained within the package.", "EB": "Precondition checking should be added to ensure that all files within the package are writeable before allowing the package to be renamed.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new package with a class unit (CU) in it.\n2. Set the CU to read-only.\n3. Attempt to rename the package.\n\nExpected behavior: The package renaming process should complete successfully.\n\nActual behavior: An unexpected exception dialog is displayed after the renaming process finishes."}
