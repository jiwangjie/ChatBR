As a result, if the CU is marked as read-only, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed after the renaming process is completed.", "OB": "1. Create a package with a compilation unit in it.\n2. Set the compilation unit to read-only.\n3. Attempt to rename the package.\n4. Observe that after the renaming process is finished, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "EB": "The system should properly handle situations where a compilation unit is set to read-only when attempting to rename a package. It should perform a check to ensure that all resources in the package are writable before proceeding with the renaming process. If any resource is marked as read-only, the system should prevent the renaming operation and display an appropriate error message.", "SR": "1. Modify the system to check if all resources in a package are writable before allowing the renaming operation to proceed.\n2. If any resource is found to be read-only, prevent the renaming operation and display an error message indicating that the resource needs to be made writable before renaming the package."}
