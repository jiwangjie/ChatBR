{"id": "10593", "title": "Bug 10593: Jar export should add \".jar\" suffix if not specified", "description": "", "OB": "When exporting a jar file without specifying a file extension, the export process does not automatically add the \".jar\" suffix to the exported file. This results in a jar file without a proper file extension.", "EB": "After fixing this bug, the jar export process should automatically append the \".jar\" suffix to the exported file if not specified by the user. This ensures that all exported jar files have the correct file extension.", "SR": "1. Modify the jar export process to check if the exported file already has a file extension. If it does not, append the \".jar\" suffix to the file name.\n2. Test the jar export functionality by exporting a jar file without specifying a file extension.\n3. Verify that the exported jar file has the \".jar\" suffix added to the file name.\n4. Also, test exporting a jar file with a specified file extension and verify that the exported file name remains unchanged.\n5. Ensure that the change does not introduce any regressions or other issues in the jar export process."}
