As a result, the UI closes the class file editors opened on this jar, which is expected for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when I tried to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI did not react.", "OB": "Currently, when the attached source of a jar is changed, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired instead of FSOURCEATTACHED or FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas.", "EB": "The UI should react by closing the class file editors opened on the jar when a FSOURCEDETACHED or FSOURCEATTACHED java delta occurs after changing the attached source of a jar.", "SR": "Modify the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta so that the UI reacts accordingly by closing the class file editors opened on the jar when the attached source is changed."}
