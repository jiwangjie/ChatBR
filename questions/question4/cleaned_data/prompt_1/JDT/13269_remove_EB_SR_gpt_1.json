Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header, now that an icon is shown as well, would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. 20020409. JRT.", "OB": "This is because the jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen. Other notes: The message 'saving manifest file failed' is perhaps incorrect in this case as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file (thus it is not really a failure).", "EB": "The order of operations in jarpackager needs adjustment to ensure overwrite verifications happen before creating the jar file. Additionally, consider revising the message 'saving manifest file failed' to better reflect that it is not a failure when the user chooses not to overwrite the manifest file.", "SR": "1. Rearrange the jarpackager operations to address the overwrite verification issue.\n2. Enhance the message 'saving manifest file failed' to accurately represent cases where the user opts not to overwrite the manifest file."}
