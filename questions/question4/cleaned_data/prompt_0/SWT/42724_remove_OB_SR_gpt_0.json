I don't believe we even need to redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection.", "OB": "The selection background in StyledText is rendered incorrectly on bidi platforms.", "EB": "The selection background should be rendered correctly on bidi platforms. drawLineSelectionBackground should only be used to render the special line break selection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open StyledText on a bidi platform. 2. Select text. 3. Observe the incorrect rendering of the selection background."}
