{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history or autocomplete suggestions.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history or autocomplete suggestions. It should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed while respecting the case of what the user types.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Trigger the Find/Replace feature.\n3. Observe that the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history or autocomplete suggestions.\n4. Attempt to perform find and replace operations while verifying that the typed entry is not automatically replaced."}
