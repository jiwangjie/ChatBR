{"id": "27869", "title": "Bug 27869: StyledText overuse of Font.getFontData", "description": "Bug 27869: The StyledText component in Eclipse is overusing the Font.getFontData API. This issue is exacerbated when scrolling the StyledText or selecting text. The Font.getFontData API is called excessively, which impacts performance. To resolve this issue, the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and updated only when the font is changed. Additionally, please note that the default English encoding for Redhat 8 is UTF-8.", "OB": "When running Eclipse and using the Java Editor, a single keystroke can trigger the Font.getFontData API to be called 13 times. This excessive usage of the API also occurs when scrolling the StyledText and selecting text. It is important to note that each Font has 7 FontData, so every time the keystroke 'a' is typed in the Java Editor, 91 (7*13) FontData will be loaded.", "EB": "The StyledText component should optimize its usage of the Font.getFontData API to improve performance. Specifically, the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and only updated when the font is changed. This change will reduce the number of unnecessary Font.getFontData calls and improve overall performance.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open Eclipse and use the Java Editor. Perform a single keystroke or scroll the StyledText while selecting text. Observe that the Font.getFontData API is called multiple times, impacting performance."}
