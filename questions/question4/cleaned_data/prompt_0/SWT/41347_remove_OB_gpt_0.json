It shouldn't do this. A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog dismissed just because the entry was selected.", "OB": "The CCombo fires a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the drop-down list using the mouse.", "EB": "It should fire a selection event instead. Default selection means something was selected, and the typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog. A combo shouldn't fire default selection just from selecting an entry in the dropdown. Hitting enter from the text field should be treated as default selection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Drop down the combo list using the mouse.\n2. Select an entry from the list using the mouse.\n3. Observe that the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event, which it shouldn't do. Standard Combos don't exhibit this behavior. Additionally, it is difficult to differentiate between just selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo."}
