  "description": "Bug 42724: StyledText selection rendered incorrectly on bidi platforms. I don't believe we even need to redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection.",
  "OB": "When forcing a redraw of the entire client area, the entire bidi segment is drawn with a selection background. The problem is that DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground includes code to redraw the entire selection background, and that code does not take bidi segments into account (direction runs). The proper selection background is therefore drawn in StyledTextRenderer.drawStyledLine, taking bidi segments and tab stops into account.",
  "EB": "drawLineSelectionBackground should only be used to render the special line break selection.",
  "SR": "1. Open the application on a bidi platform.\n2. Trigger an action that forces a redraw of the entire client area.\n3. Observe the rendering of the selection background on the bidi segment."
