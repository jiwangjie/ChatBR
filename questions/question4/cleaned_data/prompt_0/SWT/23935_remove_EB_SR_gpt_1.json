  "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus",
  "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.",
  "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.",
  "EB": "Expect the text widget to lose focus when clicking on the tree, similar to the behavior on Windows.",
  "SR": "1. Click anywhere in the tree.\n2. Observe that the tree gains focus, but the text widget does not lose focus on Linux.\n3. Note that the text widget is a child of the tree, leading to platform UI bug 2470."
