It shouldn't do this. A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected.", "OB": "If you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection. However, standard Combos won't do this. As a result, it is impossible to differentiate between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo.", "EB": "When a user selects an entry from the CCombo list using the mouse, the CCombo should not fire a defaultSelection event. This behavior should be consistent with that of standard Combos.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the CCombo dropdown list using the mouse.\n2. Select an entry from the list using the mouse.\n3. Observe if the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event."}
