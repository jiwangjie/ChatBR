{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus and does not release focus when clicking outside the tree.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when clicking outside the tree.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Click anywhere in the tree. \n2. Click outside the tree, anywhere else in the application."}
