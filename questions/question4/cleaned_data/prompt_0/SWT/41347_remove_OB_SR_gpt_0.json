It shouldn't do this. A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog dismissed just because an entry was selected.", "OB": "Currently, the CCombo component fires a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected from the dropdown using the mouse.", "EB": "It should instead only fire a selection event when an entry is selected from the dropdown using the mouse. Default selection should only occur when the user hits enter from the text field.", "SR": "1. Open the CCombo dropdown.\n2. Use the mouse to select an entry.\n3. Observe that a defaultSelection event is fired, and the dialog is dismissed, which is unexpected behavior."}
