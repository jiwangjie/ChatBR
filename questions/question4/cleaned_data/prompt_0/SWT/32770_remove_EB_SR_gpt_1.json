  "OB": "When attempting to launch a Java application using a shortcut, a dialog appears with the message: 'Launch failed: no main type found.'

It should indicate the specific issue causing the failure and suggest possible solutions, such as selecting a main type or providing clearer instructions for setting up the application.",
