{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "In Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), when opening the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars are enabled. However, they can be moved around, but they do not have any effect. This behavior is misleading, especially when opening a small image such as an icon.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled, as they currently have no functionality when interacting with the image.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: Open the ImageAnalyzer example with the mentioned build and environment. Notice the enabled scrollbars and their lack of effect when moved."}
