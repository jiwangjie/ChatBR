{"id": "24877", "title": "Bug 24877: Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog", "description": "Bug 24877: Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog. It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "OB": "When using the FileDialog, there is no way to retrieve the file extension that the user selected. This limitation affects our product as well as other scenarios, such as exporting to a jar file.", "EB": "The FileDialog should provide an API to return the 'Save as type' field that the user selected in the dialog. This would allow us to accurately determine the file extension to append to the file name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Select '.zip' in the 'Save as type' field. 2. Enter a file name (e.g., 'test')."}
