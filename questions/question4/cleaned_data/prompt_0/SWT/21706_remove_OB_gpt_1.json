  "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage",
  "OB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 uses Class.forName() to create an instance of the class, which allows for public instantiation of the class.",
  "EB": "The BidiUtil class should have a private constructor. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, adding a private constructor is a good practice. It prevents people from instantiating the class when there's no need to. This change won't add any size to the code because the compiler provides a free public constructor by default. Making the constructor private instead of public is a necessary improvement.",
  "SR": "To resolve this issue, change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); This change should maintain the same functionality."
