{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "The right tree and text widget do not lose focus correctly when interacting with the UI. The expected behavior is for the text widget to lose focus when interacting with other elements.", "EB": "When running build 20020920 and executing the attached code, both the left tree and text widgets behave as expected on Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Run build 20020920. 2. Execute the attached code. 3. Observe the behavior of the right tree and text widgets while interacting with the UI."}
