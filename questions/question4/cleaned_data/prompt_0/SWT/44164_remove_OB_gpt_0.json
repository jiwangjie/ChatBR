{"id": "44164", "title": "Bug 44164 update needed in javadoc for constructor Image(Device, ImageData)", "description": "Update needed in javadoc for constructor Image(Device, ImageData). The provided code snippet demonstrates the issue. The class TestImageInvalidImage tries to create an Image object using the constructor Image(Device, ImageData), but it throws an exception. The ImageData is successfully created, so the issue seems to be with the Image constructor.", "OB": "When running the code snippet provided, an exception is thrown when attempting to create an Image using the constructor Image(Device, ImageData).", "EB": "The javadoc should include information about the possible exceptions that can be thrown by the constructor Image(Device, ImageData). Specifically, it should mention the exception that is thrown when the ImageData object provided is invalid or cannot be handled by the underlying operating system.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Import the package org.eclipse.swt.widgets.\n2. Create a class named TestImageInvalidImage.\n3. Add the main method to the TestImageInvalidImage class.\n4. Inside the main method:\n   - Create an ImageData object with width=10, height=10, depth=1, and a PaletteData object with RGB values.\n   - Attempt to create an Image object using the constructor Image(Device, ImageData) and passing Display.getDefault() as the Device parameter.\n5. Execute the code. Note that an exception will be thrown when creating the Image object."}
