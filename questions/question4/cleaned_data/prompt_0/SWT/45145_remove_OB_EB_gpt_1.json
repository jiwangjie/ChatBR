  "title": "Bug 45145 - Second window comes to front when using first",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When using two Eclipse windows, if I switch from another application to one Eclipse window and then click on a docked view or perspective, the other window comes to the front, obscuring my other applications' windows.",
  "EB": "I expect that when I interact with a docked view or perspective in one Eclipse window, only that window should come to the front, and the other window should remain in the background, without obscuring other applications' windows.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open two separate Eclipse windows. \n2. Have other applications running in the background. \n3. Switch from another application to one of the Eclipse windows. \n4. Click on a docked view or perspective within that Eclipse window. \n5. Observe that the other Eclipse window comes to the front, covering other applications' windows."
