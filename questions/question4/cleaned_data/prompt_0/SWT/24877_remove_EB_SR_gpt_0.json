{"id": "24877", "title": "Bug 24877: Cannot get file extension from SWT FileDialog", "description": "Bug 24877: Cannot get file extension from SWT FileDialog. It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "OB": "When using the SWT FileDialog, there is currently no way to retrieve the file extension that the user selected. This is a problem because we need to know the selected file extension to perform any necessary actions, such as appending it to the file name.", "EB": "The FileDialog in SWT should provide an API that allows us to retrieve the 'Save as type' field selected by the user. This will enable us to obtain the file extension and use it accordingly.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the SWT FileDialog.\n2. Select a file with a specific extension.\n3. Attempt to retrieve the selected file extension programmatically. Currently, there is no available method to do this, which is the bug in question."}
