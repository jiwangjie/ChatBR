Open a Java file in the editor.\n2. Make some changes to the file.\n3. Use the 'Revert' option to discard the changes.\n4. Measure the time taken for the reverting process.\n5. Close the file and reopen it.\n6. Measure the time taken for this process.\n7. Compare the time taken for reverting and closing/reopening the file."}
