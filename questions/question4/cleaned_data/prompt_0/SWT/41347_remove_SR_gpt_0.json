It shouldn't do this. A typical user of a combobox would be very surprised to have the dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected.", "OB": "If you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection. Standard Combos won't do this. Because of this, you can't tell the difference between just selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo.", "EB": "The CCombo should fire a selection instead. Default selection means something was selected and you should go and do something. The typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog. A combo shouldn't fire default selection from just selecting an entry in the dropdown. Hitting enter from the text field should be treated as default selection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the CCombo drop-down list using the mouse.\n2. Select an entry from the list using the mouse.\n3. Observe that the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event instead of a selection event."}
