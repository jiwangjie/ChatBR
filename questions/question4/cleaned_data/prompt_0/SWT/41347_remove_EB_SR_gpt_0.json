{"id": "41347", "title": "Bug 41347: CCombo firing defaultSelection on mouse list selection", "description": "CCombo fires defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse. This behavior is surprising and inconsistent with standard Combos. The user would not expect the dialog to be dismissed just because an entry was selected.", "OB": "If you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection event. Standard Combos do not exhibit this behavior. Consequently, it is impossible to differentiate between selecting an entry using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that CCombo should not fire defaultSelection event when an entry is selected using the mouse. Instead, it should only fire the event when the user explicitly presses the enter key.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Drop down the CCombo list using the mouse.\n2. Select an entry using the mouse.\n3. Observe that the defaultSelection event is fired.\n\nExpected result: The defaultSelection event should not be fired when an entry is selected using the mouse."}
