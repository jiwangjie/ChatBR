There are no non-static methods in this class, so it would be a good practice to prevent people from instantiating the class unnecessarily. This change does not add any additional size because the compiler automatically provides a free public constructor. By making the constructor private, we ensure that the class cannot be instantiated.", "SR": "To resolve the issue, change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); This change should achieve the same functionality as before."}
