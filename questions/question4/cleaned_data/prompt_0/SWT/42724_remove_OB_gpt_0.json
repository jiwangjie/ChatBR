I don't believe we even need to redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection.", "OB": "The selection background includes unselected characters.", "EB": "drawLineSelectionBackground should only be used to render the special line break selection.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Build 20030903 \n2. Use the attached BidiUtil \n3. Type one English character followed by three or more Arabic/Hebrew characters \n4. Place the caret at the beginning of the line \n5. Select the next two characters, including one bidi character. \nThe selection background includes unselected characters."}
