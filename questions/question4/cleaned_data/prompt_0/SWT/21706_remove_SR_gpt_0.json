{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage ", "OB": "When using the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class in the win32 version of SWT, there is a line that uses Class.forName() to create a new instance of the Callback class. However, this usage of Class.forName() throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This causes issues in the CLDC version of SWT, especially when using tools like jxeLink. The problem does not result in a compiler error because the Eclipse compiler (and Sun's compiler) assumes that the NoClassDefFoundError class is available.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, it is suggested to add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, a private constructor would prevent unnecessary instantiation. Additionally, adding a private constructor does not increase the class size as the compiler automatically generates a public constructor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Use the BidiUtil class in the win32 version.\n3. Observe the NoClassDefFoundError when using Class.forName()."}
