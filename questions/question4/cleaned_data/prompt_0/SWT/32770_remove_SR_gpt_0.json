Also, we should improve the quality of the error message.", "OB": "When trying to launch a Java application using a shortcut, a dialog appears with the message 'Launch failed: no main type found'. It seems that we should be able to track resource selection similar to how external tools track selection for variable expansion. It might be beneficial to combine these mechanisms into a single one.", "EB": "The error message needs to be improved to provide the user with a clear hint on how to fix the problem. In this case, the message should say something like 'Launch failed: No file with a main type selected'. This will guide the user to select a resource with a main type.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, try launching a Java application using a shortcut and make sure no file with a main type is selected."}
