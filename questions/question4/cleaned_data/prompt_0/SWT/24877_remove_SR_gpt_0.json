{"id": "24877", "title": "Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog", "description": "It is not possible to retrieve the file extension that the user selected from the FileDialog. This issue makes the dialog almost unusable as we are unable to determine the correct file extension to append to the file name. This problem can be demonstrated when exporting to a JAR file. ", "OB": "There is no available API or method to retrieve the file extension selected by the user in the FileDialog. This becomes a problem when using the dialog in our own product as well as when exporting to a JAR file.", "EB": "The FileDialog should provide an API or method to obtain the 'Save as type' field that the user has selected. In the case of the JAR export wizard, when the user enters 'test' as the file name and selects '.zip' as the 'Save as type' field, the wizard should use 'test.zip' as the JAR file name.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Select a Java file.\n2. Go to File -> Export...\n3. Choose JAR file and click Next.\n4. Click on Browse... to open the Save As file dialog.\n5. Enter 'test' as the file name.\n6. Select '.zip' as the 'Save as type' field.\n7. Click Save.\n\nResult: The JAR export wizard uses 'test' as the JAR file name.\n\nExpected result: The JAR export wizard should use 'test.zip' as the JAR file name."}
