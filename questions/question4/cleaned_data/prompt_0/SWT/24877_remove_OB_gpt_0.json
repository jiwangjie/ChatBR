It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine the correct file extension to append to the file name.", "OB": "When using the swt FileDialog, the file extension cannot be obtained. This makes it difficult to determine the correct file extension when saving a file.", "EB": "The export wizard should automatically append the correct file extension to the file name provided by the user. In this specific case, when selecting the .zip file type, the export wizard should use the file name 'test.zip' instead of just 'test'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Select a Java file \n2) Go to File -> Export... \n3) Select JAR file and press Next \n4) Press Browse... to select a Save As file dialog \n5) Enter 'test' for the file name \n6) Select '.zip' for the 'Save as type' field \n7) Press Save \n\nThe JAR export wizard should display 'test.zip' in the JAR file field, but it only shows 'test'."}
