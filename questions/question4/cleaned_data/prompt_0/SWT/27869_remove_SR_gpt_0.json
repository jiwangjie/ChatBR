I believe that the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and updated only when the font is changed.", "OB": "Running eclipse and using the Java Editor, a single key stroke can cause the API Font.getFontData() to be called 13 times. This API is also overused when scrolling the StyledText and selecting text. Each Font has 7 FontData, therefore every time 'a' is typed in the Java Editor, 91 (7*13) FontData will be loaded.", "EB": "I believe, and many people agree, that this API does not need to be used at all by the StyledText when it is being typed.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse.\n2. Open the Java Editor.\n3. Type a single character.\n4. Observe the excessive number of calls to Font.getFontData()."}
