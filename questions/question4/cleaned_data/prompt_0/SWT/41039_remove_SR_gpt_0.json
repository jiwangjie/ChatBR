  "OB": "When using Eclipse 3.0 M2Build with Build ID 200307181617 on Mac OS X 10.2.6, the following issue occurs: 1) Open the Find/Replace dialog by navigating to Edit -> Find/Replace. 2) Type a search term into the text box. 3) Press the Return key. However, nothing happens when you press the Return key. The expected behavior is that pressing the Return key should trigger a 'Find' operation, which should be equivalent to clicking on the 'Find' button. The 'Find' button is highlighted as the 'default' button in the Find/Replace dialog.",
