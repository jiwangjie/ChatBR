Btw, UTF8 is the default English encoding for Redhat 8. FontMetrics API is also very used by the StyledText. I believe that the metric information should be cached in the StyledText and updated only when the font is changed.", "OB": "The Font.getFontData method in the StyledText class is being overused, impacting performance especially on platforms like Motif running on UTF8. This method is causing poor performance.", "EB": "The metric information in the StyledText class should be cached and updated only when the font is changed. This optimization will improve the performance of the StyledText component.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Add a 'System.out.println' statement in the first line of the 'getFontData' method.\n2. Run a self-hosted Eclipse instance.\n3. Observe the console for any impact on performance.\nKeep in mind that this problem is more pronounced on platforms like Motif running on UTF8 encoding."}
