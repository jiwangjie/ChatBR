Also, we should improve the quality of the error message.", "OB": "When attempting to launch a Java application using the shortcut, an error message is displayed. However, the error message does not provide any helpful information to the user.", "EB": "The error message should give the user a hint about what they need to do to fix the problem. In this case, they need to select a resource. The message should say something like 'Launch failed: No file with a main type selected'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a Java file containing a main method. \n2. Select a non-resource-based view (such as the Debug view). \n3. Click 'Debug As' > 'Java Application'."}
