Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are the only ones relative to the location of the FontRegistry class (org.eclipse.jface.resource path). It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "When trying to create a FontRegistry instance for an application using resources outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource package, a MissingResourceException is thrown.", "EB": "Alternatively, the FontRegistry should allow clients to load their own resource bundle and take it as a parameter to the constructor (instead of the name of the bundle).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a class com.company.product.MyClass. 2. In the MyClass, add the method createFontRegistry(). 3. In the createFontRegistry() method, try to create a FontRegistry using resources outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource package. For example: FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\"). 4. Observe the MissingResourceException being thrown."}
