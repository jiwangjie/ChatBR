  "description": "Bug 22360[Fonts] FontRegistry can not be instantiated using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource. Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are only the ones relative to the location of the FontRegistry class, org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "When I try to create a FontRegistry instance for my application using the following code:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nI get a MissingResourceException. However, if I try this instead:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nThere is no exception. Moreover, if I create a complete copy of the FontRegistry class in my com.company.product package, then it works. My guess is it is a bug in the FontRegistry. It tries to load the fonts resource bundle, but the FontRegistry's class loader is used to do that (see readResourceBundle(String) FontRegistry method).", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
