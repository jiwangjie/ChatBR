Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are only relative to the location of the FontRegistry class in the org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "When trying to create a FontRegistry instance for the application using resources outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource path, a MissingResourceException is thrown.", "EB": "The FontRegistry should be able to be instantiated using resources outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource path by providing a client class or class loader as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Create a FontRegistry instance in a class outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource path using resources from a different location.  \n2. Attempt to access the FontRegistry instance.  \n3. Observe that a MissingResourceException is thrown instead of the expected behavior of successfully accessing the FontRegistry instance."}
