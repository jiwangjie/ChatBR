However, the action could have written to the status line. We currently do not have the API necessary to get the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. The problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "The keybinding service in Emacs always clears the status line.", "EB": "The keybinding service in Emacs should not always clear the status line when running in the default mode.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Emacs in the default mode.\n2. Perform an action that writes to the status line.\n3. Notice that the status line is cleared after the action is performed."}
