It already tried, and it can't.", "OB": "When a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of Eclipse until the perspective is displayed one time. After restarting Eclipse, the same error message is displayed. It seems that the workbench is trying to create this view again.", "EB": "The plugin was not available the last time Eclipse was closed, so the workbench should no longer have any reference to this plugin.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse and make sure the 'java' perspective is displayed.\n2. Remove the plugin associated with an invalid view from the Eclipse installation.\n3. Restart Eclipse.\n4. Notice the 'Unable to restore perspective ...' error message.\n5. Close Eclipse and restart it again.\n6. Verify that the same 'Unable to restore perspective ...' error message is still displayed."}
