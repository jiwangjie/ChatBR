{"id": "19933", "title": "Bug 19933: Emacs keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When running with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, in some cases, the action could have written to the status line. Currently, there is no API available to retrieve the message in the status line, making it impossible to solve the problem in general. However, it is possible to solve the problem for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When running in Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. When a mode is entered, the key sequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "The status line should not be cleared when an action writes to it in Emacs keybindings. The key sequence that started the mode should be written to the status line when a mode is entered.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Enable Emacs keybindings in the software.\n2. Perform an action that writes to the status line.\n3. Observe that the status line message is cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode."}
