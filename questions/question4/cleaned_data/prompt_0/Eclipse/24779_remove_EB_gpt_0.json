                    "OB": "When a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of eclipse, until the perspective is displayed one time. The 'java' perspective is displayed. After restarting eclipse, the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed. This behavior continues even after removing the plugin. Why do we still get this error message? Why does the workbench try to create this view again?",
                    "EB": "Expect that when a perspective contains an invalid view due to the removal of its corresponding plugin, the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message should not persist after the plugin removal. The workbench should not attempt to recreate the missing view, and users should not encounter this error message after removing the plugin.",
                    "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open eclipse and load a view that belongs to a plugin that can be easily added and removed (e.g., EditorList plugin).\n2. Open another perspective (e.g., the 'Java' perspective).\n3. Close eclipse, ensuring that you have two open perspectives.\n4. Remove or move the plugin that contains the view used in step 1.\n5. Switch to the perspective that contains the view, which no longer exists due to the plugin removal.\n6. You will encounter the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message.\n7. Close and restart eclipse to observe that the error message persists. After restarting, the error should no longer appear."
