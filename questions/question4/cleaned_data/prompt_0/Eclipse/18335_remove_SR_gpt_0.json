{"id": "18335", "title": "Bug 18335 - Perspective contents lost when view is maximized", "description": "", "OB": "All the contents of the perspective (views, layout info) are lost when the view is maximized. When a view is maximized in any perspective, only the maximized view is visible, and all other views are missing.", "EB": "The proper layout should be preserved when the workbench is closed. The temporary layout used for the maximized view should not be persisted.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open any perspective in F1. 2. Maximize any view in the perspective. 3. Observe that only the maximized view is present and all other views are missing from the perspective."}
