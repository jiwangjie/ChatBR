{"id": "19933", "title": "Bug 19933: Emacs keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "The keybinding service in Emacs always clears the status line, even though the action could have written to it. Currently, there is no API available to retrieve the message in the status line, making it impossible to solve the problem in general. However, the issue can be resolved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When using Emacs keybindings in build 20020611, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by the 'AcceleratorScope.resetMode' function. Additionally, when entering a mode, the key sequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "The 'AcceleratorScope.resetMode' function is intended to clean up the status line once the appropriate action has been executed.", "SR": ""}
