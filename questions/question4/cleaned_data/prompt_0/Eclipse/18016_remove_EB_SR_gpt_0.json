The enabled entries are: 1) Open Declaration, 2) Open Type Hierarchy, 3) Open Super Implementation, 4) Show in Packages View, 5) Copy, and 6) Search. The 'Copy' action could potentially perform a function, but it is not functioning correctly as of now. There is also a related bug (Bug 18015) regarding the structured selection. This should be considered a major bug as it is likely to affect many users.", "EB": "Most menu actions should be disabled for customizations from the repository. Only the relevant and meaningful actions should be enabled for use.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software. \n2. Access the menu. \n3. Check for the enabled menu entries and observe that they do not perform any action when selected."}
