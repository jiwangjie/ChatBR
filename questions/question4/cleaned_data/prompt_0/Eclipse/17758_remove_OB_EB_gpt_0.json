{"id": "17758", "title": "Bug 17758 - Problems with 'Go Into' action in Navigator View", "description": "The 'Go Into' action in the Navigator View is causing some problems.", "OB": "After performing certain actions in the Navigator View, the 'Go Into' action is not functioning correctly. Specifically, when navigating through projects, going into a project, going up, going back, and going back again, the action works fine. However, after this sequence of actions, the 'forward' button is still enabled, but clicking on it leads to a blank screen. Only after clicking the 'forward' button again and then 'back', does the view return to the expected state.", "EB": "The 'Go Into' action in the Navigator View should consistently navigate through projects without any issues. The 'forward' button should correctly display the next screen and clicking on it should lead to the expected content, rather than a blank screen.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Ensure a clean build of F1. \n2. Import all plugins from the runtime environment to have some projects. \n3. Pack a project, for example, 'org.eclipse.ant'. \n4. Perform the following sequence of actions: \n   a. Go into a project. \n   b. Go up. \n   c. Go back. \n   d. Go back again. \n   e. Observe the enabled 'forward' button. \n   f. Click on the 'forward' button. \n   g. Observe a blank screen. \n   h. Click on the 'forward' button again. \n   i. Click on the 'back' button. \nExpected Result: The 'forward' button should navigate to the next screen and display the expected content, rather than a blank screen."}
