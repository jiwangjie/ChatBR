  "description": "Bug 22360[Fonts] FontRegistry can not be instantiated using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource. Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are the only ones relative to the location of the FontRegistry class org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.",
  "OB": "When I attempt to create a FontRegistry instance for my application using the following code:\n\n```java\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n  FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n```\nI get a MissingResourceException. I have a file named 'fonts.properties' in my 'com/company/product/' folder. However, if I try this instead:\n\n```java\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n  ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n```\nThere is no exception. Furthermore, if I create a complete copy of the FontRegistry class in my 'com.company.product' package, then it works. My guess is that it is a bug in the FontRegistry. It attempts to load the font resource bundle, but the FontRegistry's class loader is used to do that (see 'readResourceBundle(String)' FontRegistry method).",
  "EB": "I expected that I should be able to create a FontRegistry instance using the 'com.company.product.fonts' resource without encountering a MissingResourceException. The FontRegistry class should be able to handle resources located outside the 'org.eclipse.jface.resource' path.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class 'com.company.product.MyClass'.\n2. Within the 'MyClass' class, define a method 'createFontRegistry()'.\n3. Inside the 'createFontRegistry()' method, attempt to create a FontRegistry instance using the following code:\n\n```java\nFontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n```\n4. Run the application, and the MissingResourceException should be encountered."
