{"id": "14197", "title": "Removing a working set immediately makes changes", "description": "When attempting to remove a working set, it immediately changes the package view.", "OB": "The package view is filtered when a working set with one project is created and selected. However, when the working set is deleted, the package view in the background is refiltered.", "EB": "The package view should not be refiltered at the moment of delete. Instead, refiltering should only occur when closing the working set selection dialog. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to the working sets, including canceling the removal of the set.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Create a working set with one project and select it. 2. Attempt to delete the working set. Verify that the package view is immediately refiltered in the background. 3. Also, attempt to cancel the removal of the working set and ensure that all changes made to the working sets are cancelled."}
