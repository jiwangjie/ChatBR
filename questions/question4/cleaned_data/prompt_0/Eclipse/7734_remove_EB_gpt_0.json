{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734 - System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt files, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt files. A warning or question message box should be displayed, giving users a chance to save their dirty files. However, currently, when the user left-clicks on the Windows Start menu and selects the \"Shut Down...\" command to shutdown/reboot the computer, there is no warning or question message box displayed. As a result, the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately without any opportunity to save the dirty files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the \"Shut Down...\" command to shutdown/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected results: A warning or question message box should be displayed, giving users a chance to save their dirty files before the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs, like Word and Outlook, already provide this functionality."}
