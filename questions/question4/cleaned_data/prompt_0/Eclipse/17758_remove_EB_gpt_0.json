After some specific steps, the behavior is not as expected.", "OB": "When starting from a clean F1 build and importing all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects, packing a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant), and then performing the actions 'go into', 'go up', 'go back', 'go back', everything works fine at first. However, when the project is closed and the forward button is clicked, it leads to a blank screen. Clicking the forward button again does not seem to do anything. Additionally, the 'Go Into' action is disabled.", "EB": "The 'Go Into' action should always be enabled, and when the forward button is clicked, it should take the user to the appropriate screen instead of a blank screen. Clicking the forward button multiple times should have the expected behavior.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Start from a clean F1 build.\n2. Import all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects.\n3. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant).\n4. Perform the following actions in order: 'go into', 'go up', 'go back', 'go back'.\n5. Close the project.\n6. Click the forward button.\n7. Observe that it leads to a blank screen.\n8. Click the forward button again and observe that it does not have any effect.\n9. Notice that the 'Go Into' action is now disabled."}
