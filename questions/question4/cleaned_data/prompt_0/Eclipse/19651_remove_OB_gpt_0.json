{"id": "19651", "title": "Bug 19651: Team menu disappears from Hierarchy and Packages view",
  "description": "The team menu disappears after following certain steps. The issue was initially encountered with a file managed by CVS, but it is also reproducible with a file not in any CVS repository.",
  "OB": "When performing certain actions in Eclipse:",
  "EB": "The team menu should be consistently available in the Hierarchy and Packages views.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:1) Open Eclipse with a new workspace.2) Switch to the Java perspective and close the Resource perspective.3) Create a Java Project named 'TestProject'.4) Create a Java class named 'TestClass'.5) Paste the provided code snippet in the TestClass and save it.6) Change the preference 'WorkbenchPerspective' to open the perspective in a new window.7) Change the preference 'Java' to 'Open a new Type Hierarchy Perspective'.8) Exit the workbench and restart it.9) In the Package view, select the TestClass (the class itself, not a unit) and right-click to open the popup menu. The team menu should be there (disabled, but it doesn't affect the bug).10) Once again, exit the workbench and restart it.11) Select the word 'InnerClass' in the text editor and press F4.12) Open the popup menu on the newly opened Hierarchy view. The team menu should not be available, which is expected because 'InnerClass' is an inner class.13) Select the word 'TestClass' in the new text editor and press F4. The team menu should be available, as 'TestClass' is not an inner class.14) You should now have 3 opened windows. Close the two new windows.15) Finally, select the TestClass in the Package view and right-click to open the popup menu. The team menu should no longer be there."}
