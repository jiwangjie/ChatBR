Problems with 'Go Into' action ", "OB": "When trying to use the 'Go Into' action in the Navigator view, there are several problems. Firstly, when closing a project, the history is not cleaned up and no indication appears in the Navigator view that the project is closed. Additionally, when opening another project and selecting a folder, the 'Go Into' action is enabled.", "EB": "Perhaps closing a project should clean up the history, and a text indicating that the project is closed should appear in the Navigator view. Furthermore, when opening a new project and selecting a folder, the 'Go Into' action should only be enabled if it is valid for the selected folder.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start with a clean F1 build.\n2. Import all plugins from the runtime environment to get some projects.\n3. Pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant).\n4. Attempt to use the 'Go Into' action.\n5. Close the project.\n6. Verify that the history is not cleaned up and no indication appears in the Navigator view.\n7. Open another project (e.g., org.eclipse.lucene).\n8. Select a folder (e.g., 'bin').\n9. Verify that the 'Go Into' action is enabled, even though it may not be valid for the selected folder."}
