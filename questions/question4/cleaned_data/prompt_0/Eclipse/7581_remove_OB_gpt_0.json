{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The combo box in the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet column. If any of the strings in the combo box is wider than the column, the combo box grows to the width of the largest item. As a result, the drop-down button may be located off the visible area of the property sheet and get clipped. Users cannot see the drop-down button unless they make the property sheet view wider.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always match the width of the property sheet column. This is how the DialogCellEditor (with a visible button) works. It needs to be investigated whether this issue is specific to our implementation or related to SWT library.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit objects using the row with name-value pairs in two columns.\n3. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create a ComboBoxCellEditor as a cell editor in column two.\n4. Provide the ComboBoxCellEditor with strings.\n5. Set a string that is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n6. Observe that the combo box grows to the width of the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be off the visible area of the property sheet."}
