This behavior occurs when manipulating the working sets, not just when closing the working set selection dialog. Additionally, pressing cancel does not cancel all changes made to working sets, including the removal of a working set.", "EB": "At the moment of deletion, the package view in the background should not refilter. Refiltering should only happen when closing the working set selection dialog. Pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to working sets, including the removal of a working set.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a working set with one project and select it. Notice that the package view is filtered.\n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set. Delete the first working set."}
