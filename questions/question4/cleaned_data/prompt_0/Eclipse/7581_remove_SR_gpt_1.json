  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...",
  "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor is not resizing correctly within the property sheet.",
  "EB": "I would have expected the ComboBoxCellEditor to always match the width of the property sheet column. It should behave the same way as DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. We need to investigate whether this issue is within our code or related to SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit).",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Select a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not match the width of the property sheet column as expected."
