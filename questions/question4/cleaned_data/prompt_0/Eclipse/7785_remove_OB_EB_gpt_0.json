The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When performing the SaveAs operation, the file extension is not automatically included in the file name. As a result, the saved file does not have a visible file extension in the Navigator.", "EB": "The SaveAs operation should include the appropriate file extension in the file name, ensuring the saved file has the correct file type. The file icon should remain consistent with the parent java file icon in both the project view and the Navigator.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1) Open an existing java file\n2) Modify the file (e.g., move an existing class)\n3) Click the SaveAs icon next to the Save Icon\n4) In the dialog that appears, browse for a valid container location\n5) Type the filename without including the extension, as it is not requested\n6) Click OK\n\nObserve that the file is added to the specified location in the Navigator, but the file extension is not displayed."}
