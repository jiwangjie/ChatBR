Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are only relative to the location of the FontRegistry class in the org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "The FontRegistry class currently cannot be instantiated using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource.", "EB": "The FontRegistry class should allow clients to load their own resource bundle and take it as a parameter to the constructor (instead of the name of the bundle).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, try to instantiate the FontRegistry class using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource. The class will not be able to find the required resources."}
