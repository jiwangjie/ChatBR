This issue seems to be related to the handling of NL-specific subdirectories. \n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Start Eclipse.\n2. Delete the following file: <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif\n3. Edit the file <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini\n4. Change the value of the aboutImage property to: aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif\n5. Edit the file <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini\n6. Change the value of the aboutImage property to: aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif\n7. Open the about dialog.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- The main image is not displayed in the about dialog.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- The main image should be displayed in the about dialog.\n\nThis suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but that the '$nl$' path segment is not being handled correctly."}
