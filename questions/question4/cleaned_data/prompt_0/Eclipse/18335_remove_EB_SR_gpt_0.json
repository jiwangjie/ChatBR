Only the maximized view is present, and all other views are missing from the perspective. It appears that the view maximize code replaces the page layout with a temporary one that only contains the maximized view.", "EB": "Perspectives should retain all their contents when a view is maximized. The maximized view should be displayed alongside the other views in the perspective.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open any perspective in F1.\n2. Maximize a view in the perspective.\n3. Observe that all the other views are missing from the perspective and only the maximized view is visible."}
