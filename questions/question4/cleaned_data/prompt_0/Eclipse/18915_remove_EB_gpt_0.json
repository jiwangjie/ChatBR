{"id": "18915", "title": "Bug 18915 - Preferences switching between erroneous preferences pages should generate error, not warning.", "description": "", "OB": "When entering invalid data on any preference page and attempting to select another page without fixing the problem, a warning dialog is displayed with the message 'The currently displayed page contains invalid values'.", "EB": "The warning dialog should be replaced with an error dialog indicating that the user is not allowed to leave the page without fixing the mistake.", "SR": "To reproduce:  \n1. Enter invalid data on any preference page, causing the UI to display a red flag indicator.  \n2. Without fixing the problem, attempt to select a different preference page.  \n3. Note that a warning dialog with the message 'The currently displayed page contains invalid values' is shown.  \n\nExpected result: An error dialog should be displayed instead of a warning dialog."}
