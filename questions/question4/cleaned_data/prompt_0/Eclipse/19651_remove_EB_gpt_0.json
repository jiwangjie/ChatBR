{"id": "19651", "title": "Bug 19651: Team menu disappears from Hierarchy and Packages view", "description": "It was observed that in step '9', the Team menu is present in the popup menu for the TestClass in the package view. However, in step '15', after closing two new windows, the Team menu is no longer there. Note: TestClass.java is not in any CVS repository, but the problem was initially observed with a file managed by CVS.", "OB": "When selecting the TestClass in the package view and opening the popup menu, the Team menu is missing after closing two new windows.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the Team menu should remain available in the popup menu for the TestClass in the package view, even after closing two new windows.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1) Open eclipse with a new workspace. 2) Open the Java perspective and close the Resource perspective. 3) Create a Java Project named 'TestProject'. 4) Create a Java class named 'TestClass'. 5) Paste the provided code into the TestClass and save it. 6) Change the preference 'WorkbenchPerspective' to open the perspective in a new window. 7) Change the preference 'Java' to 'Open a new Type Hierarchy Perspective'. 8) Exit the workbench and restart it. 9) Select the TestClass (the class itself, not the unit) in the package view and open the popup menu. The Team menu should be present (even if it is disabled). 10) Exit the workbench and restart it again. 11) Select the word 'InnerClass' in the text editor and press F4. 12) Open the popup menu on the new hierarchy view. The Team menu should not be there, which is expected since it is an inner class. 13) Select the word 'TestClass' in the new text editor and press F4. The Team menu should be present, since it is not an inner class. 14) There should be three opened windows. Close the two new windows. 15) Select the TestClass in the package view and open the popup menu again. The Team menu should not be there anymore."}
