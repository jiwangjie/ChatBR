The entries are: open declaration, open type hierarchy, open super implementations, show in packages view, copy, and search. The bug report also mentions that 'copy' could be made to mean something, but it does not work as of now. The bug is marked as major and likely to happen to many users. However, the rest of the bug report is unclear and should be removed.", "OB": "There are 6 enabled menu entries (open declaration, open type hierarchy, open super implementations, show in packages view, copy, search), but none of them perform any action.
