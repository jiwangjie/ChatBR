Build 200205291235.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Start eclipse.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif.\n- Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini.\n- Change the value of the aboutImage property: aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif.\n- Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini.\n- Change the value of the aboutImage property: aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif.\n- Open the about dialog.\n- There is a main image again.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- Open the about dialog.\n- There is no main image.\n\nThis suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but that the $nl$ path segment is not being handled correctly.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Exit eclipse.\n2.
