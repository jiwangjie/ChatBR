Therefore, all the resources that are being looked up are the only ones relative to the location of the FontRegistry class org.eclipse.jface.resource path. It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter to the constructor.", "OB": "When I try to create a FontRegistry instance in my application using the code snippet below, I encounter a MissingResourceException:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nI have a file named fonts.properties located in the com/company/product/ folder. However, if I modify the code to use ResourceBundle instead, as shown below, no exception is thrown:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nAdditionally, if I create a copy of the FontRegistry class in my com.company.product package, the code works without any issues. Based on my analysis, it seems to be a bug in the FontRegistry class. It attempts to load the fonts resource bundle using the FontRegistry's class loader.", "EB": "The FontRegistry class should allow instantiation using resources located outside the org.eclipse.jface.resource package. It would be helpful if FontRegistry accepted a client class (or class loader) as an additional parameter in the constructor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in your application, similar to the following:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\n\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\n2. Ensure that there is a file named fonts.properties located in the com/company/product/ folder.\n3. Execute the createFontRegistry() method.\n\nObserve that a MissingResourceException is thrown."}
