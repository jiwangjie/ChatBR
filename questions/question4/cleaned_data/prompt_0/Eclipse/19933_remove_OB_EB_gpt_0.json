However, the action could have written to the status line. We currently do not have the API necessary to get the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. The problem can be solved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When running in with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. When a mode is entered, the keysequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "The keybinding service in Emacs should not clear the status line when an action writes to it. The message in the status line should be preserved unless specifically cleared by the user.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Build version 20020611.\n2. Enable Emacs keybindings.\n3. Perform an action that writes to the status line.\n4. Observe that the message in the status line is cleared by the AcceleratorScope.resetMode function."}
