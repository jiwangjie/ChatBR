{"id": "19933", "title": "Bug 19933: Emacs keybinding service always clears status line", "description": "When running in Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, in some cases, the action should be able to write to the status line without it being cleared. Currently, we do not have the necessary API to get the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. However, we can solve it for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When running in with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. When a mode is entered, the key sequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "When an action writes to the status line, the message should not be cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode, except when running in the default mode.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Enable Emacs keybindings in the settings.\n2. Perform an action that writes to the status line.\n3. Observe that the status line message is cleared."}
