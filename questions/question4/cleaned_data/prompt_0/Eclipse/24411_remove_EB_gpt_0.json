However, upon returning to the welcome page, the clicked link is not selected. The ProductInfoDialog dialog currently selects links when clicked, which provides more context to the user. But this behavior is not observed for other links on the welcome page.", "EB": "The links on the welcome page should be selected when clicked, just like the ProductInfoDialog dialog does, to provide more context to the user when they return to the welcome page.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
