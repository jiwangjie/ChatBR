{"id": "19651", "title": "Bug 19651: Team menu disappears from Hierarchy and Packages view", "description": "It was present in step 9. Note: TestClass.java is not in any CVS repository, but I first noticed the problem with a file managed by CVS.", "OB": "When the TestClass is selected in the package view, and the popup menu is opened, the team menu is no longer displayed.", "EB": "(Again) When the word InnerClass is selected in the text editor and F4 is pressed, the popup menu is opened in the new hierarchy view, but the team menu is not displayed. This behavior is expected since it is an inner class. However, when the word TestClass is selected in the new text editor and F4 is pressed, the team menu is not displayed even though it should be since it is not an inner class. There should be 3 opened windows.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the Hierarchy and Packages view.\n2. Perform the steps mentioned in the bug description to reach step 15.\n3. Select the TestClass in the package view.\n4. Open the popup menu.\n5. Observe that the team menu is not displayed."}
