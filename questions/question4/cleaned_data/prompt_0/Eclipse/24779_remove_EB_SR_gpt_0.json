{"id": "24779", "title": "Bug 24779[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed", "description": "Bug 24779[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed. It seems that even after removing the plugin corresponding to an invalid view in a nondisplayed perspective, the error message 'Unable to restore perspective' continues to be displayed after each launch of Eclipse. This is confusing as we expect the error message to stop appearing once the plugin is removed. The issue can be replicated by following the steps below:", "OB": "When a nondisplayed perspective contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), a 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of Eclipse, until the perspective is displayed one time. For example, when the 'java' perspective is displayed, and then Eclipse is restarted, the same error message is displayed. This behavior is unexpected and incorrect.", "EB": "The 'Unable to restore perspective' error message should not be displayed after removing the plugin corresponding to an invalid view in a nondisplayed perspective. The workbench should recognize that the invalid view is no longer present and should not attempt to recreate it.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Start Eclipse with a nondisplayed perspective that contains an invalid view. 2. Remove the plugin corresponding to the invalid view. 3. Restart Eclipse. 4. Observe that the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is still displayed, indicating that the issue persists."}
