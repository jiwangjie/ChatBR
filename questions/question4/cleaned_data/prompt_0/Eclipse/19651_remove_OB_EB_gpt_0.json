Note: TestClass.java is not in any CVS repository, but I first saw the problem with a file managed by CVS.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "Bug 19651: Team menu disappears from Hierarchy and Packages view.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open eclipse with a new workspace.\n2. Open java perspective and close resource perspective.\n3. Create a Java Project named 'TestProject'.\n4. Create a Java class named 'TestClass'.\n5. Paste the provided code into the TestClass and save it.\n\npublic class TestClass {\n   static class InnerClass extends Runnable {\n      public void run() {\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n6. Change preference WorkbenchPerspective to open perspective in a new window.\n7. Change preference Java to 'Open a new Type Hierarchy Perspective'.\n8. Exit the workbench and restart it.\n9. Select the TestClass (the class, not the unit) in the package view and right-click on it to open the popup menu. The team menu should be there (disabled but that does not matter).\n10. Exit the workbench and restart it again.\n11. Select the word InnerClass in the text editor and press F4.\n12. Open the popup menu on the new hierarchy view. The team menu is not there, but that is expected since it is an inner class.\n13. Select the word TestClass in the text editor and press F4. The team menu is not there, but it should be since it is not an inner class.\n14. You should have 3 opened windows. Close the two new windows.\n15. Select the TestClass in the package view and open the popup menu. The team menu is not there anymore."}
