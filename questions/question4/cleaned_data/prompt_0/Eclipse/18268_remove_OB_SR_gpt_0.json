Build 200205291235. Steps to reproduce: \n\n1. Start Eclipse. \n2. Delete <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/eclipselg.gif. \n3. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini. Change the value of the aboutImage property to aboutImage=$nl$/eclipselg.gif. \n4. Edit <install/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform2.0.0/about.ini. Change the value of the aboutImage property to aboutImage=nl/en/eclipselg.gif. \n5. Open the about dialog. \n\nObserved Behavior: There is a main image again. This suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but that the \"$nl$\" path segment is not being handled correctly.", "OB": "There is a main image again.", "EB": "Open the about dialog.\n\nObserved Behavior: There is no main image.\nExpectation: It should have found it in step 6.", "SR": "Open the about dialog."}
