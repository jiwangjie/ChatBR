A UI (Preference) should be provided in the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values for line delimiters should be Dos/Windows, Mac, and Unix default platform line delimiter. This UI should be available in the Workbench so that all plugins can use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario: Use Unix and Windows workstations to develop a Unix product/program and create a new file on Windows using the Workbench."}
