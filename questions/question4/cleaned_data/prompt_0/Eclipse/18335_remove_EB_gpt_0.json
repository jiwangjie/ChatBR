{"id": "18335", "title": "Bug 18335 - Perspective contents lost when view is maximized", "description": "", "OB": "When a view is maximized in any perspective, all the contents of the perspective including other views and layout information are lost. Only the maximized view is present, and all other views are missing from the perspective. It appears that when a view is maximized, the page layout is temporarily replaced with a layout that only contains the maximized view.", "EB": "When a view is maximized, the other views in the perspective should remain visible and not be lost. The page layout should be able to accommodate the maximized view without removing other views.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Switch to another perspective.\n2. Exit the workbench.\n3. Open the workbench again.\n4. Switch to the perspective with the maximized view.\n   - Verify that all the views in the perspective are still present, including the maximized view."}
