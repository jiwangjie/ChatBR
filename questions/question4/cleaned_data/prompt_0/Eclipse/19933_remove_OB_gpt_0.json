However, the action could have written to the status line. We currently do not have the necessary API to retrieve the message in the status line, so it is not possible to solve the problem in general. The problem can be resolved for some cases by not clearing the status line when running in the default mode.", "OB": "When running in with Emacs keybindings, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. When a mode is entered, the key sequence that started the mode is written to the status line.", "EB": "AcceleratorScope.resetMode is intended to clean up the status line once the appropriate action has been run.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Build version 20020611.\n2. Run the software with Emacs keybindings.\n3. Perform any action that writes to the status line.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe message in the status line should remain after the action is performed.\n\nNote: The problem can be observed specifically when running in the default mode."}
