  "title": "Bug 124620 - Referenced Parameter icon should be invalid if the parameter in library is deleted",
  "description": "When deleting a parameter from the library and reopening the report design file, the icon of the parameter appears unaffected. However, performing similar operations on a dataset results in the dataset icon becoming invalid.",
  "OB": "Upon reopening the report design file, the icon of the referenced parameter remains unchanged. In contrast, performing similar operations on a dataset in the report causes the dataset icon to become invalid.",
  "EB": "The referenced parameter icon should be marked as invalid when the corresponding parameter in the library is deleted, similar to how the dataset icon is handled in such situations.",
  "SR": "1. Open a report design file that references a parameter from the library.\n2. Delete the parameter from the library.\n3. Reopen the report design file and observe the status of the referenced parameter icon.\n4. Compare this behavior with the icon of a dataset by performing similar operations on a dataset in the report."
