{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return some user recognizable strings", "description": "", "OB": "When calling IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction, the labels returned are null. However, after data extraction, the labels become recognizable strings.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for IMetaData.getColumnLabel() to return user recognizable strings both before and after data extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction.\n2. Extract the data.\n3. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() again after data extraction.\n4. Note the difference in the returned labels before and after extraction."}
