  "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border value for row count",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When sorting on disk and selecting 40000 rows of data, if the program is configured to process data less than 40000 rows, unexpected operations occur.",
  "EB": "Expect more robust logic for sorting on disk when the row count is on the border value. The sorting process should handle data less than the specified row count seamlessly without unnecessary operations.",
  "SR": "1. Open the program and configure it to sort data on disk.\n2. Set the row count to 40000.\n3. Configure the program to process data less than 40000 rows.\n4. Observe the unexpected operations during the sorting process."
