{"id": "120922", "title": "Dirty Page behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "The current behavior in the XML Report Designer editor is causing inconvenience to the user. When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed insisting that the changes need to be saved. The user is then prompted to choose whether to save, discard, or cancel the changes. The confirmation dialog that appears is titled 'Error'.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that the user is left to figure out how to properly save or discard their changes. The error message displayed is also not very informative, simply stating 'Source page is dirty'.\n\nThis behavior needs improvement to provide clearer guidance to the user and enhance the overall user experience.", "OB": "When attempting to switch back to the Layout view after editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, an error message is displayed stating 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "The user should be presented with clear options and instructions on how to save or discard their changes when encountering the 'Dirty Page' behavior. The error message should also provide more informative details.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Switch to the 'source' view of the Layout Editor.\n3. Make changes to the XML.\n4. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n5. Observe the error message and lack of clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes."}
