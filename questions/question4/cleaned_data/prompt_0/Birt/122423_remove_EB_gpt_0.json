There can only be one page in case a page number is set.", "OB": "For the RenderTask, when using PDF format, if a page range is specified, a message should be logged stating that range is not supported, and the entire report should still be output. For HTML format, the RenderTask should support page range in the format of '1,2,510' + 'All'. If the page range includes an invalid page number, it should be logged as an error message and returned.", "EB": "The RenderTask should handle the specified page range correctly, logging appropriate messages for unsupported range and invalid page numbers. The output should either contain the complete report or the specified pages separated by a page splitter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use the RenderTask with PDF format and specify a page range.\n2. Check the log for a message stating that the range is not supported and verify that the entire report is still being output.\n3. Use the RenderTask with HTML format and specify a valid page range, e.g., '1,2,510' + 'All'.\n4. Check the log for any error messages related to invalid page numbers.\n5. Verify that the RenderTask outputs the specified pages with a page splitter in between, or the complete report if no page range is set."}
