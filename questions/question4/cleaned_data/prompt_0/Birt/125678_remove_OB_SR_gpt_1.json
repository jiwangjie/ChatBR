  "description": "In my application, I get the design time instance of the chart and then call a method which runs the report.",
  "OB": "The original chart instance obtained during design time remains unmodified after running the report. The chart does not reflect the data it should be bound to.",
  "EB": "I expect the chart to be updated with the data after running the report. The behavior observed is inconsistent with previous versions of BIRT, specifically till BIRT 2.0M3, where the chart was correctly updated after running the report.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Obtain the design time instance of the chart in the application.\n2. Call the method to run the report.\n3. Check the chart to see if it reflects the data it should be bound to."
