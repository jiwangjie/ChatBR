For global expressions, such as {params['p1']}, {new DateTime()}, they should always be available and evaluatable within the BIRT scripting environment. Currently, Dte scriptExpression has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, and ONEACHROW.", "OB": "When trying to evaluate global expressions that are not in the iteration loop, a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException is thrown.", "EB": "Global expressions, such as {params['p1']}, {new DateTime()}, should be valid and evaluable even when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop. They should not throw a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, try to evaluate global expressions, such as {params['p1']}, {new DateTime()}, outside of the iteration loop and observe the 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException that is thrown."}
