{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page loads every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. However, when using the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the schema filter is present. Despite this, there is still a warning message displayed during the page load since the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter, to prevent the warning message from appearing during page load.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query. 2. Use the iSeries platform with the JTOpen JDBC drivers. 3. Observe that the tree control loads every schema on the system, resulting in a warning message during page load. 4. Apply a filter or expand the tree to see if the warning message still persists."}
