However, Value2 is not cleared after converting the operator from BETWEEN to EQUAL.", "OB": "Currently, when the operator is changed from BETWEEN to EQUAL in the highlight rule, Value2 is not being cleared or reset.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the operator is changed from BETWEEN to EQUAL in the highlight rule, Value2 should be automatically cleaned or reset.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Insert a data.\n2. Set a highlight rule in the Property Editor and save the report.\n3. Modify the highlight rule and change it to 1 equal 1 with the color blue.\n4. Observe if Value2 is automatically cleaned or reset after changing the operator."}
