This is a BiDI specific defect.\n\nActual Behavior: In the Query screen of the Edit Data Set dialog, the order of BiDi (Hebrew or Arabic) characters is incorrect, making the query unreadable. Examples:\n1. In the first row, the name of the column and part of the table name are switched.\n2. In the third row, part of the constant, table name, and column name are mixed up.", "OB": "It is similar to another defect in which a similar problem is reported for the Expression Builder dialog. However, in this defect, we are specifically referring to the context of the Query screen in the Edit Data Set dialog.", "EB": "The order of BiDi characters in the Query screen should be correct and readable.", "SR": "To Reproduce:\n1. Create a DB2 database.\n2. Create a user with a Latin name.\n3. Create a table under this user with a mixed Latin and BiDi name.\n4. Create a Data Source based on the DB.\n5. Create a Data Set based on the table.\n6. Add a column name from step 4 to the select portion of the SQL query.\n7. Add the table name from step 3 to the from portion of the SQL query."}
