When we drag the dataset to the layout and add another filter (FilterB) to the table, the actual result is that the filter depends on DataResultA, which is incorrect. Instead, we expect the filter to depend on DataResultB.", "OB": "When a filter is added to the table on the layout after dragging the dataset, the filter is based on DataResultA.", "EB": "When a filter is added to the table on the layout after dragging the dataset, the filter should be based on DataResultB.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Drag the dataset to the layout. \n2. Set a filter (FilterB) on the table. \n3. Observe that the filter is based on DataResultA instead of DataResultB."}
