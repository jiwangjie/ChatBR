The expected result is that the filter should be applied to DataResultB.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a report and add a new datasource and dataset.\n2. Set a filter (FilterA) on the dataset, which narrows down the dataset to 6 records (DataResultB).\n3. Drag the dataset to the layout and set another filter (FilterB) on the table."}
