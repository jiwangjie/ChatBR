For global expressions, such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}, it should always be available and evaluable within the BIRT scripting environment. Currently, the Dte scriptExpresson has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, ONEACHROW.", "OB": "The BEFOREFIRSTROW only works when the cursor is just about to enter the first row, and AFTERLASTROW only works when the cursor is just about to leave the last row. Once the iteration is finished, both types won't work anymore. A 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException will be thrown if you try to evaluate these expressions. However, these global expressions are not dependent on the data row iteration. The current naming of BEFOREFIRSTROW/AFTERLASTROW is misleading and should be changed to ONSTARTROW, ONENDROW or other names that are clearer.", "EB": "The global expressions, such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}, should be available and evaluable even if the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop. There should not be any exceptions thrown for these expressions once the iteration is finished. Additionally, the BEFOREFIRSTROW/AFTERLASTROW naming should be changed to ONSTARTROW/ONENDROW or other names that better reflect their functionality.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Write a BIRT report with global expressions such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}. 2. Make sure the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop. 3. Execute the report and observe that the global expressions cannot be evaluated once the iteration is finished. 4. Try to evaluate the expressions after the iteration and observe that a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException is thrown."}
