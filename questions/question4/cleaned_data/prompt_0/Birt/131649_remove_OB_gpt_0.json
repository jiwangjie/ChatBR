This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. The expression row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"] does not work when running the report. The correct behavior should be to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression. The first index to the \"rows\" array represents the nested table's level (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, and so on).", "OB": "When running the report, the expression row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"] does not produce the expected result.", "EB": "The report designer should determine the correct index number by considering the nesting levels of all tables.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign).\n2. Double click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression.\n3. Click on \"Available Data Sets\" and choose the data set \"offices\".\n4. Double click on the column \"COUNTRY\"."}
