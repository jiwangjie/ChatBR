If a page range is specified, parse it and output the pages one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the runAndRenderTask function. If only one page number is set, there should still be a page splitter added. For PDF format, if a range is specified, log a message saying that range is not supported and still output the whole report. For HTML format, support page ranges in the form of '1, 2, 510' + 'All'. If an invalid page number is provided, it should be logged and an error message should be returned.", "OB": "When a page range is specified in the render task, support is provided to output the specified pages with a page splitter in between.
