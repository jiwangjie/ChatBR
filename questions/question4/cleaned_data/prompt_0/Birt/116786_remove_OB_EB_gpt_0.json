{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path.", "OB": "Currently, when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer is not generating the relative path, and the absolute path to the library is saved instead.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate the relative path when including a library in a report design, and save the relative path instead of the absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the BIRT designer. \n2. Create a new report design. \n3. Include a library from a different location using an absolute path. \n4. Save the report design. \n5. Close and reopen the report design. \n\nExpected behavior: \n- The library inclusion should be stored with a relative path. \n\nObserved behavior: \n- The library inclusion is stored with an absolute path."}
