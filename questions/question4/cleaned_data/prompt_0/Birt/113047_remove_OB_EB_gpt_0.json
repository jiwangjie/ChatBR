Closing and reopening the data set editor should not be necessary to resolve the issue.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Create a new data set without a SQL statement.\n2. In the data set editor, go to the data source page.\n3. Change the data source to a new one.\n4. Observe that the new data source has no database/table/column information listed as children nodes. \n5. Close the data set editor and reopen it to see if the issue persists."}
