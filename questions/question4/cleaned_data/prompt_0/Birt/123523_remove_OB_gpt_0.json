{"id": "123523", "title": "Bug 123523 - Previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler throws NPE", "description": "(See ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath). The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all. ", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, a NullPointerException (NPE) is thrown at the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath because the context is null. ", "EB": "The software should use an alternative mechanism to obtain the class loader if the context is null, instead of throwing a NullPointerException. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Preview a scripted data set \n2. Observe the NPE thrown at the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath due to the null context. "}
