The new data source does not show any database, table, or column information.", "EB": "The children nodes should be listed when changing the data source. The expected result is that when a new data source is selected, the corresponding children (database, table, column information) should be listed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new data set without a SQL statement. \n2. Open the data set editor and go to the data source page. \n3. Change the data source to a different one. \n\nActual result: No children nodes are listed for the new data source. \n\nTo workaround the issue, close the data set editor and reopen it."}
