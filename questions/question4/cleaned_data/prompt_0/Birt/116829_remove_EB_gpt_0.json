Instead, the label height remains the same as before the font modification.", "OB": "The label height is not updated to reflect the change in font size. It remains the same as it was before the font modification.", "EB": "The label height should adjust automatically to accommodate the new font size.

Edit the font size of the label and set it to \"18 points\". \n3. Observe that the label height does not change to reflect the modified font size."}
