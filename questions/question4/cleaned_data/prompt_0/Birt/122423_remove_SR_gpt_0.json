{"id": "122423", "title": "Bug 122423: Support page range in RenderTask", "description": "Bug 122423: Support page range in RenderTask. If a page range is specified, the code should parse it and output the pages one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the runAndRenderTask function. If only one page number is set, there should be only one page in the output. Currently, there is no support for page range in the render task.", "OB": "When using the render task in PDF format, if a page range is specified, a message indicating that the range is not supported should be logged, but the whole report is still outputted. For HTML format, page ranges in the form of '1,2,510' + 'All' should be supported. If an invalid page number is provided, it should be logged, and an error message should be returned.", "EB": "The code should check if a page range is set in the render task. If a range is provided, it should output the specified pages with a page splitter in between. If an invalid page number is encountered, it should be logged, and an error message should be returned. If neither a page range nor a page number is set, the code should default to outputting all pages instead of giving an error message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, create a render task and specify a page range using the format '1,2,510'. Run the render task and check the output. Additionally, try running the render task without setting a page range or page number and verify that it defaults to outputting all pages."}
