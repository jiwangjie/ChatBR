{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which easily amounts to several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message displayed on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand instead of populating the entire schema on load.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the data set editor. \n2. Wait while the entire schema is queried. \n3. Eventually, you will get the warning message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. \nBug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on the schema, which is related to this issue."}
