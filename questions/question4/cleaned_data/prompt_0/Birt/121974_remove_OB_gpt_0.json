For global expressions, such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}, it should always be available and evaluatable within the BIRT scripting environment. Currently, Dte scriptExpresson has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, ONEACHROW.", "OB": "When attempting to evaluate global expressions that are not within the iteration loop, a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException is thrown.", "EB": "Global expressions should be able to be evaluated successfully regardless of whether the ResultIterator is in the iteration loop or not.", "SR": "To reproduce, try to evaluate global expressions (e.g., {params['p1']}, {new DateTime()}) when the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop. Note that these global expressions are not related to the data row iteration, so the evaluation should not throw a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException."}
