The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all.", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set, if the ExecutionContext's context is null, a NullPointerException is thrown in the ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath method.", "EB": "If the ExecutionContext's context is null, an alternative mechanism should be used to obtain the class loader, instead of relying on the context. This will prevent a NullPointerException from being thrown.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Preview a scripted data set.\n2. Ensure that the ExecutionContext's context is null.\n3. Observe that a NullPointerException is thrown in the ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath method."}
