Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled \"Error\" (including the quotes).", "OB": "The current behavior in the XML Report Designer editor is that other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. A dialog titled \"Error\" prompts the user with options to save, discard, or cancel the changes.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be for the XML Report Designer editor to display a dialog with the message \"XML Report Design has been changed\" instead of \"Dirty Page\". The dialog should not include quotes. Additionally, the dialog should provide clear options for saving, discarding, or canceling the changes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor. \n2. Make changes to the XML Report Design. \n3. Attempt to navigate to other pages without saving the changes. \n\nExpected behavior: \nThe editor should display a dialog titled \"XML Report Design has been changed\" with clear options to save, discard, or cancel the changes. The dialog should not include quotes."}
