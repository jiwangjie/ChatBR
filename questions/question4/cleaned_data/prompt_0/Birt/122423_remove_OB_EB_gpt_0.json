Note that when a page number is set, there can only be one page. ", "OB": "The software does not currently support page range in the RenderTask.", "EB": "The software should support page range in the RenderTask.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Use the RenderTask with a page range specified. 2. Observe that the software does not output the pages within the specified range. For the PDF format, a message should be logged indicating that page range is not supported. For the HTML format, the software should support page range in the form of '1,2,510' + 'All'. If no range is set, the software should check if a page number is set."}
