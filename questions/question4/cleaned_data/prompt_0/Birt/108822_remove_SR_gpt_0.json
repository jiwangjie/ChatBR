{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border values for row value", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting on disk, if 40000 rows of data are sorted and the program is set to process less than 40000 rows, the program currently performs unnecessary operations.", "EB": "More efficient logic is expected to handle disk sorting when there are border values for row values. It is recommended to sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process less than 40000 rows. 3. Observe the unnecessary operations being performed."}
