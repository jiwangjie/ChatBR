{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' is entered for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the filterInfo data is lost. This data should persist and be stored in the .rptdesign file.", "EB": "The filter information should persist in the .rptdesign file instead of being lost. Additionally, it is suggested to use the plain XPath expression (prepended with the path from the data set selector itself) and handle filtering separately for those who require it.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', for the column mapping. \n3. Leave the dialog. \n4. Verify that the filterInfo data is lost and does not persist in the .rptdesign file."}
