{"id": "121974", "title": "Bug 121974 - Can't evaluate global expressions when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop", "description": "Bug 121974 - Can't evaluate global expressions when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop. For global expressions, such as {params['p1']}, {new DateTime()}, it should always be available and evaluable within the BIRT scripting environment. Currently, Dte scriptExpression has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, and ONEACHROW.", "OB": "When the cursor is just about to enter the first row, the BEFOREFIRSTROW type works. When the cursor is just about to leave the last row, the AFTERLASTROW type works. However, once the iteration is finished, both types no longer work. If you try to evaluate these expressions, a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException will be thrown. These global expressions are not related to the iteration over data rows. The current names, BEFOREFIRSTROW and AFTERLASTROW, are misleading and should be changed to ONSTARTROW and ONENDROW or other names that provide better clarity. This bug currently prevents the evaluation of nondatarow expressions (e.g., expressions from title url action) in charts that are not within a data row iteration. The chart needs to evaluate these expressions from the action after data binding.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a global expression such as {params['p1']} or {new DateTime()}.\n2. Ensure that the ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop (cursor is not in the first or last row).\n3. Attempt to evaluate the expression.\n4. Observe the 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException."}
