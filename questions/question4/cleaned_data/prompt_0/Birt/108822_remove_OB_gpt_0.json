{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822: More efficient disk sorting logic needed for handling border values in row data", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for disk sorting does not efficiently handle border values in row data.", "EB": "We need to improve the logic for disk sorting to process border values in row data more efficiently. This can be achieved by sorting the data directly in memory before writing it to a file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort the data on disk with 40,000 rows.\n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40,000 rows.\n3. Observe the following operations:\n   a. Save the file as a temporary file.\n   b. Load the file into memory.\n   c. Sort the data.\n   d. Save the sorted data to a temporary file."}
