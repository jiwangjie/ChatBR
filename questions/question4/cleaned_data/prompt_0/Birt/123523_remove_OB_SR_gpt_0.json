The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all.", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, a NullPointerException (NPE) is thrown due to the null context.", "EB": "The software should use an alternative mechanism to get the class loader if the context is null.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Configure a scripted data set with a java event handler. 2. Preview the data set. 3. Observe the NullPointerException."}
