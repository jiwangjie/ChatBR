{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a two-level table to list offices and their employees. The expression 'row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]' is used, but the report does not run correctly. When the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY', the correct behavior should be to insert 'rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]' into the expression. The index '0' corresponds to the outermost table. Currently, 'row[\"OFFICECODE\"]' is invalid in the inner table, and the expression needs to use the 'rows' object for accessing the outer table's columns.", "OB": "The report design runs without any issues. However, when the designer tries to append a country name suffix to each employee's name (e.g., 'Diane Merphy / USA'), by adding the expression 'row[\"COUNTRY\"]' to the expression text, the problem arises. The expression is not valid in the inner table.", "EB": "When the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY', the designer should replace 'row[\"COUNTRY\"]' with 'rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]' in the expression.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). Double click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression. Click on 'Available Data Sets' and choose data set 'offices'. Then, double click on the 'COUNTRY' column."}
