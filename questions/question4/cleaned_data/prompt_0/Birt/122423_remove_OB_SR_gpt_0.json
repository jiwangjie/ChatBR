{"id": "122423", "title": "Bug 122423: Support page range in RenderTask", "description": "Bug 122423: Support page range in RenderTask. If a page range is provided, the code should parse it and output the pages one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the runAndRenderTask. If only a single page number is specified, there can only be one page in the output. Currently, there is no observed behavior mentioned in the bug report, so it is unclear what is currently happening in the code base.", "OB": "Please provide the observed behavior so that the issue can be further analyzed.", "EB": "The code should check if a page range is set. If a range is invalid or not provided, it should log an error message and return it. If neither a range nor a single page number is set, the code should default to rendering all pages, instead of giving an error message as it currently does.", "SR": "1. Set a valid page range or a single page number.\n2. Execute the RenderTask.\n3. Check for any error messages or unexpected behavior in the output."}
