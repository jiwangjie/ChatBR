                    "SR": "To reproduce the issue:1. Create a DB2 database.2. Create a user with a Latin name.3. Create a table under this user with mixed Latin and BiDi name (e.g., 'EMANNMULOC').4. Create a Data Source based on the DB from step 1.5. Create a Data Set based on the table from step 3.6. Add the column name from step 4 to the select portion of the SQL query.7. Add the table name from step 3 to the from portion of the SQL query.8. Execute the SQL query in the Query window."
