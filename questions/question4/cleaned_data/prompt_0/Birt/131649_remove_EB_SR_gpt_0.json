{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this: row['FIRSTNAME'] + ' ' + row['LASTNAME'] + ' / ' + row['OFFICECODE'].\n\nHowever, this report will not run. The correct behavior when the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY' is to insert rows[0]['COUNTRY'] into the expression. \nThe first index (an integer) to the 'rows' array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the dataset (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, etc.).", "OB": "When the designer adds the expression 'row['COUNTRY']' to append a country name suffix to each employee name (e.g., 'Diane Merphy / USA'), the expression does not work. The inner table cannot access the outer table's columns using the 'row['COLUMN_NAME']' syntax. Instead, the correct way for the inner table to access the outer table's columns is by using the 'rows' object.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the designer should be able to append the country name suffix to each employee name by using 'rows[0]['COUNTRY']' in the expression.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a design with a 2-level table listing offices and their employees.\n2. Add an expression to append the country name suffix to each employee name.\n3. Observe that the expression does not work as expected, as the inner table cannot access the outer table's columns using the 'row['COLUMN_NAME']' syntax.\n4. Correct the expression by using the 'rows' object, specifically 'rows[0]['COUNTRY']', to access the outer table's columns.\n5. Verify that the expression now works as expected and appends the country name suffix to each employee name."}
