Set a filter in the data set using the expression \"row[0] equals to 0\". \n2. Click on the Preview tab.\n\nActual result: The first result record is returned when previewing.\n\nExpected result: As the developer mentioned, row[0] can only be generated after all the data has been fetched. Row[0] should not be taken as a filter expression."}
