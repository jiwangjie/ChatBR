  "description": "Bug 120922 - 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement. Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. Do you want to save the changes? <Yes <No <Cancel Yes would save the changes, No would discard the changes, Cancel would do nothing and remain on the Source page. In addition, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).",
  "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is the user has to figure out what he needs to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very clear. The error message is 'Source page is dirty.'",
  "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be: XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog needs to use a better title (and certainly should not have the quotes).",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open XML Report Designer.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor.\n3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n4. Observe the error message indicating that you need to save your changes."
