{"id": "124599", "title": "Bug 124599 - Shortcut delete and menu delete act differently in table column", "description": "Shortcut delete and menu delete act differently in table column.", "OB": "In step 2, when using the shortcut delete, the whole grid in the group header is deleted. In step 3, when using the delete option in the context menu, the grid in the group header remains untouched.", "EB": "When using the shortcut delete or the delete option in the context menu in the table column, the behavior should be consistent. The whole grid in the group header should either be deleted in both cases or remain untouched in both cases.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Perform an action that activates the table column. \n2. Use the shortcut delete and observe the behavior. \n3. Undo the previous action and click delete in the context menu to observe the behavior."}
