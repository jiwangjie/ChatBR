For global expressions, such as {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}, it should always be available and evaluable within the BIRT scripting environment. Currently, Dte scriptExpression has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, ONEACHROW.", "OB": "When ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop, global expressions like {params['p1']},{new DateTime()} cannot be evaluated within the BIRT scripting environment.", "EB": "It should return a correct result value whenever evaluated within the BIRT scripting environment. Therefore, a new GLOBAL expression type is required to mark this need.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n 1. Open the BIRT scripting environment. \n 2. Create a global expression, e.g., {params['p1']},{new DateTime()}. \n 3. Verify that the global expression can be evaluated correctly when ResultIterator is not in the iteration loop."}
