  "title": "Bug 123523: Previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler throws NPE",
  "description": "(See ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath). The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all.",
  "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, a NullPointerException (NPE) is thrown. The NPE occurs in the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath when trying to retrieve the class loader from the ExecutionContext. The context is null in this case.",
  "EB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, the system should be able to retrieve the class loader from the ExecutionContext without throwing a NullPointerException.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Preview a scripted data set \n2. Observe the NPE thrown at the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath due to the null context. "
