{"id": "115960", "title": "Bug 115960: Datetime values retrieved from table show different format in dynamic text item and data/text item", "description": "When working with datetime values in a table, there is an inconsistency in the displayed format between dynamic text items and data/text items.", "OB": "In the dynamic text item, the datetime values are displayed in a different format than in the data/text item. This inconsistency may lead to confusion for users relying on consistent date and time representation throughout the application.", "EB": "The datetime values retrieved from the table should consistently adhere to a standardized format across dynamic text items and data/text items. Users expect a uniform presentation of date and time to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Insert a text item containing a datetime value from the table. \n2. Insert a data/text item with a datetime value from the same table. \n3. Observe the difference in the displayed datetime formats between the dynamic text item and the data/text item."}
