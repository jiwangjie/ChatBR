{"id": "123523", "title": "Bug 123523 - Previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler throws Null Pointer Exception (NPE)", "description": "(See ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath). The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all.", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set mapped to a java event handler, a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) is thrown in the ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath method. This occurs when the context is null.", "EB": "The software should handle the situation when the context is null and avoid throwing a Null Pointer Exception. Instead, it should either provide an external map to use as cache or not perform any caching at all.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software and navigate to the scripted data set preview section. \n2. Configure the scripted data set to be mapped to a java event handler. \n3. Attempt to preview the data set. \n4. Note that a Null Pointer Exception is thrown in the ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath method when the context is null."}
