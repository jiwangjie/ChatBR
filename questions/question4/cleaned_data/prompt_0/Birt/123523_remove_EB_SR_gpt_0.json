The context will be null in this case. The reason for using the context is to use cached class loaders when possible. We can either provide an external map to use as cache, or not bother with caching at all. ", "OB": "When previewing a scripted data set, an NullPointerException (NPE) is thrown. The issue occurs when attempting to retrieve a class loader from the ExecutionContext. Specifically, the method ScriptExecutor.getClassUsingCustomClassPath() is unable to access the context, resulting in a null value.", "EB": "When previewing a scripted data set, the system should successfully retrieve the class loader from the ExecutionContext and prevent the occurrence of a NullPointerException.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software \n2. Navigate to the menu and select 'Preview Scripted Data Set' \n3. Follow the prompts to map the data set to a java event handler \n4. Observe that a NullPointerException is thrown when trying to retrieve the class loader from the ExecutionContext."}
