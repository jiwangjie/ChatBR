This is not an NLS-specific defect. Otherwise, the query will fail. The problem occurs on the Query screen in the Edit Data Set dialog. When dragging and dropping columns into the Query screen, every entity name, including those with blanks, must be enclosed in quotation marks. On selecting 'Preview Results', an exception is fired when the table name or column name contains a blank. However, if no exception is issued when 'Preview Results' is selected for a column name without a blank.", "OB": "When a table or column name contains a blank, selecting 'Preview Results' on the Query screen in the Edit Data Set dialog fires an exception.", "EB": "When a table or column name contains a blank, selecting 'Preview Results' on the Query screen in the Edit Data Set dialog should not fire an exception.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a DB2 database. \n2. Make sure it has a column with a name containing a blank. \n3. Create a Data Source based on the database from step 1. \n4. Create a Data Set based on the table from step 2. \n5. On the Query screen, drag and drop the column name from step 2 into the select portion of the clause. \n6. Manually change the SQL query as follows: select USER."}
