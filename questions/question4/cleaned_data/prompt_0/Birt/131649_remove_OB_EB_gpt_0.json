{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649: Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "Bug 131649: Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this: row['FIRSTNAME'] + ' ' + row['LASTNAME'] + ' / ' + row['OFFICECODE']. However, this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on 'COUNTRY' is to insert rows[0]['COUNTRY'] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the 'rows' array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, etc.).", "OB": "The report design does not run when the user double-clicks on the 'COUNTRY' column. The expression used to construct the column reference is incorrect.", "EB": "When the user double-clicks on the 'COUNTRY' column, the report design should insert rows[0]['COUNTRY'] into the expression.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). Double-click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression. Click on 'Available Data Sets', choose data set 'offices', then double-click on column 'COUNTRY'."}
