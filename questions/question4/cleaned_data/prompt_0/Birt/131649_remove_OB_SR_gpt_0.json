{"id": "131649", "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table", "description": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this: <code>row['FIRSTNAME'] + ' ' + row['LASTNAME'] + ' / ' + row['OFFICECODE']</code>. However, this report will not run. The correct behavior when the user double-clicks on 'COUNTRY' is to insert <code>rows[0]['COUNTRY']</code> into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the 'rows' array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table, etc.).", "OB": "The report does not run when the user double-clicks on 'COUNTRY'.", "EB": "The report designer should figure out the correct index number by looking at the nesting levels of all tables.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Open the report designer.  \n2. Add a 2-level table that lists offices and their employees.  \n3. Construct an expression like this: <code>row['FIRSTNAME'] + ' ' + row['LASTNAME'] + ' / ' + row['OFFICECODE']</code>.  \n4. Double-click on the 'COUNTRY' field.  \n5. Check that the expression inserts <code>rows[0]['COUNTRY']</code> into the expression instead of the incorrect column reference."}
