Make a Servlet 3.0 web app (let's name it foo) with the metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBINF/web.xml.", "OB": "When starting the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and accessing http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html in a browser, the expected result is a 200 response and index.html being served. However, the actual result is a 404 error. Modifying the web.xml to metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restarting the app allows /foo/index.html to respond as expected. Testing the same web app with Glassfish v3.0.1 shows that it works as expected regardless of the metadatacomplete attribute.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that resources should be served from /WEBINF/lib/{.jar}/METAINF/resources even when the metadatacomplete attribute is set to \"true\" in the web.xml file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a Servlet 3.0 web app with the metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute in the webapp element of the /WEBINF/web.xml file.\n2. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2.\n3. Access http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html in a browser.\n4. Observe the 404 error instead of the expected 200 response and index.html being served."}
