{"id": "50793", "title": "Bug 50793: Invalid DispatchType in ServletRequestListener on async dispatch", "description": "Bug 50793Invalid DispatchType in ServletRequestListener on async dispatch", "OB": "When a ServletRequestListener is defined and is invoked after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch(), the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST rather than ASYNC.", "EB": "When the actual servlet is invoked, the type should be correctly set to ASYNC. If the listener is intended to be invoked for each dispatch, then the DispatcherType should match the value returned in the filter/servlet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Define a ServletRequestListener.\n2. Call AsyncContext.dispatch() in the application code.\n3. After the dispatch, check the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest and observe that it is REQUEST instead of ASYNC."}
