Created attachment 25997: NioEndpoint.java and simple web application. Sometimes, the server's CPU reaches 100% and stays at 100% until the server is restarted. This issue has been reproduced with Java versions 1.6.007, 1.6.018, and 1.6.021. It seems to be a duplicate of issue Bug 46373. It appears that the Jetty team has fixed a similar problem: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel. I added some logging to NioEndpoint.java.", "OB": "With the added logging, it can be observed that the selector.select(timeout) method sometimes returns zero keys on the Linux platform.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use the provided patched NioEndpoint.java file with logging.\n2. Deploy the provided simple web application.\n3. Monitor the server's CPU usage and observe that it reaches 100% and remains at 100% until the server is restarted. Note that this issue is never reproduced on the Windows platform.\n\nAttachments:\n- NioEndpoint.7z\n- Patched NioEndpoint.java (with logging)\n- web.7z (simple web application)"}
