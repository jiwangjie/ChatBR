{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.", "OB": "When starting two instances of Tomcat with the same configuration at the same time, the first instance starts successfully but the second instance fails due to an error in StandardService.initInternal() where the connector.init() call cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() is caught in StandardService.initInternal() and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown. This rethrown exception is further caught in Catalina.load() and then rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.", "EB": "I would expect that in StandardService.initInternal(), the connector.init() call fails, because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in Catalina.load() and then rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties\n   org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
