However, the actual result is a 404 error. Modifying the web.xml to have metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restarting the app resolves the issue and the /foo/index.html URL responds as expected. Testing the same webapp with Glassfish v3.0.1 shows that it works as expected regardless of the value set in the metadatacomplete attribute.", "EB": "When metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in the web.xml, the resources should still be served from /WEBINF/lib/{.jar}/METAINF/resources in the webapp.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1.
