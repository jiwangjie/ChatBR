Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role. ", "OB": "The implementation of the new login and logout methods is excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. Checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/password login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed.", "EB": "The division of responsibility should be improved for the isUserInRole and login/logout methods. The implementation of the new login and logout methods should be made less intrusive into the internals of the authentication. The checking of the installed Authenticator to support user/password login should be more flexible to accommodate other authenticators.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Consider a web app with two roles A and B and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A."}
