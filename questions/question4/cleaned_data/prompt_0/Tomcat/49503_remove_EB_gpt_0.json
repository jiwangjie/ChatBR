Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. The first instance starts successfully.\n2. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties\n   `org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true`\n3. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time.\n\n[1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html", "OB": "When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connectors in Catalina.load() should bind to their ports before the startup sequence continues. This would prevent the issue of the second instance failing in an unexpected way.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Start the first Tomcat instance successfully.\n2.
