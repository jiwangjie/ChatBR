Make a Servlet 3.0 webapp (let's name it foo) with metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBIBNF/web.xml.2.", "OB": "When the web app (foo) is started in Tomcat 7.0.2 and accessed through http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html, the actual result is a 404 error. The expected result is a 200 response and index.html should be served. When modifying the web.xml to metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restarting the app, now accessing /foo/index.html responds as expected. The same webapp tested with Glassfish v3.0.1 works as expected regardless of the metadatacomplete attribute's value. Upon reviewing the Servlet 3.0 specification, it appears that the metadatacomplete attribute only regulates annotation and web fragment processing. However, in this case, the handling of bar.jar within the example does not involve annotations or web fragments but is still affected by the metadatacomplete attribute.", "EB": "The jar file (bar.jar) should be placed in /WEBINF/lib.", "SR": ""}
