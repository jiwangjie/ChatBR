Note: This situation appears to be similar to bug 21288, which was fixed and described as 'DirContext caching problem with Dreamweaver 6 when recursively creating directories'. To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: 1. Use a jackrabbit client. 2. Create a HttpClient: HttpClient client = new HttpClient(); 3. Generate a new directory URL: String newDir = 'http://localhost:8080/webdav/output/' + UUID.randomUUID() + '/'; 4. Comment out this request to make the second PropFind successful: HttpMethod propFindMethod1 = new PropFindMethod(newDir); client.executeMethod(propFindMethod1); propFindMethod1.releaseConnection(); 5. Execute a MkCol request: HttpMethod mkcolMethod = new MkColMethod(newDir); client.executeMethod(mkcolMethod); mkcolMethod.releaseConnection(); 6. Execute a PropFind request: HttpMethod propFindMethod = new PropFindMethod(newDir); client.executeMethod(propFindMethod); propFindMethod.releaseConnection();", "OB": "When executing a PropFind call on a resource after executing a MkCol call for the same resource, a 404 error is returned.", "EB": "The PropFind call for the resource should return a successful response instead of a 404 error.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1.
