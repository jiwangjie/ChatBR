{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 incorrect information about custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "The bug report states that there is an issue with Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1, where it incorrectly states that a custom cookie name affects URL rewriting. The current behavior does not reflect this statement.", "OB": "The current behavior contradicts the information provided in Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1. When using a custom cookie name, the system does not perform URL rewriting and instead falls back to using the default cookie name 'jsessionid'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a custom cookie name is set, the URL rewriting should be affected accordingly. This means that the custom cookie name should be used in URL rewriting instead of the default 'jsessionid' name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Deploy the provided war file named 'cookiename.war'. 2. Access the URL 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'."}
