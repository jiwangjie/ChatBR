That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service in Tomcat, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat actually stops after printing the message and performing System.exit(1) in Catalina.stopServer(). Additionally, when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "The error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' should not be printed when using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service. If possible, the code should be improved to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), allowing it to be woken up by a notifyAll() call or using the interrupt() call to wake it up (if the thread is known).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml configuration file.\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service.\n3. Check the catalina.20100427.log file for the error message 'No shutdown port configured.
