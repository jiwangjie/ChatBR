The expected behavior is for the DispatchType to be ASYNC when the actual servlet is invoked. If the listener is intended to be invoked for each dispatch, then the DispatcherType should match the value returned in the filter/servlet.", "OB": "When a ServletRequestListener is defined and is invoked after a call to AsyncContext.dispatch(), the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST rather than ASYNC.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the DispatchType to be ASYNC when the actual servlet is invoked.
