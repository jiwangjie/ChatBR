Created attachment 26089 [details] to improve division of responsibility for isUserInRole and login/logout methods.There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility.\n\n1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current Tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. However, jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\n2. The implementation of the new login and logout methods are excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. Checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/pw login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed.\n\nObserved Behavior (OB): If the user is not in the mapped role, the original role is tested. However, the current implementation reports true for both A and B.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB):\n(a) To be reasonably amenable to a jacc implementation, Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and, if possible, the servlet name to the wrapper.\n(b) If there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. A user that logs in and is in role A and not B should be able to test if they are in A (false) and if they are in B (true).\n\nSteps to Reproduce (SR): Both problems should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The authenticator should also be able to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results."}
