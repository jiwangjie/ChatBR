Created attachment 26089 [details] to improve division of responsibility for isUserInRole and login/logout methods. There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility.\n\n1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.\n\n2. Both should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The authenticator also ought to be able to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results.", "OB": "The current implementation of isUserInRole reports true for both roles A and B, even when the user is only in role A and not B.", "EB": "To be reasonably amenable to a jacc implementation, Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and, if possible, the servlet name to the wrapper. If there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. A user that logs in and is in role A and not B should be able to test if they are in role A (false) and if they are in role B (true).", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Log in to the system with a user who is in role A and not in role B.\n2. Call the isUserInRole method using the user's session and check for both roles A and B."}
