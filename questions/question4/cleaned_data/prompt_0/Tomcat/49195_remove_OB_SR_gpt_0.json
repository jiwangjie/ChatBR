That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat works as expected but prints an error message.", "EB": "It would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await() so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use the interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml file.\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service.\n3. Check the console output for the error message."}
