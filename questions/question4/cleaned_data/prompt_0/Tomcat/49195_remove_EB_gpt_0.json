{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Windows service with shutdown port set to 1 prints error message", "description": "When using Tomcat as a Windows service and setting the shutdown port to 1 in the server.xml file, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. However, Tomcat still stops successfully after printing the error message. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server object is not null, which allows Tomcat to be shut down properly.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port for the Tomcat Windows service, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down. \n\nDespite this error message, Tomcat is still successfully stopped.", "EB": "The error message stating that no shutdown port is configured should not be printed when using 1 as the shutdown port for the Tomcat Windows service. Tomcat should be able to stop without any error message when using this configuration.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Attempt to shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
