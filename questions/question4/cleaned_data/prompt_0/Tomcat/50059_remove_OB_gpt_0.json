Make a Servlet 3.0 web app (let's name it foo) with metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBIBNF/web.xml.2.", "OB": "When metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in the web.xml, resources located in /WEBINF/lib/{.jar}/METAINF/resources are not served.", "EB": "The correct behavior is to serve the resources located in /WEBINF/lib/{.jar}/METAINF/resources even when metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in web.xml.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a jar file (let's name it bar.jar) containing a single /METAINF/resources/index.html file.\n2. Start the web app (foo) in Tomcat 7.0.2.\n3. In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.\nExpected result: A 200 response with the index.html file served.\nActual result: A 404 response is received.\nHowever, if the web.xml is modified to metadatacomplete=\"false\" and the application is restarted, accessing /foo/index.html will work as expected.\nNote: This issue was also tested with Glassfish v3.0.1, and the resources are served as expected regardless of the value of the metadatacomplete attribute.\nBased on a quick look at the Servlet 3.0 specification, it seems that the metadatacomplete attribute only regulates annotation and web fragment processing."}
