See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": "The source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class' in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from `injars`.", "EB": "Declare warning messages should list the source path in the form 'app/Main.class' when targeting .class files from `injars`.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. 2. Observe the declare warning message with the incorrect source path format."}
