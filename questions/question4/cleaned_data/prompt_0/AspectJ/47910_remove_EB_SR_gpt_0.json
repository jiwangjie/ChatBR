The issue occurs when calling ajc with sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar and an output file is created with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation suggests that the outjar parameter should create a zip file, but it doesn't seem to function correctly.", "OB": "When executing the 'ajc' command with the 'outjar' parameter to specify an output file and the 'sourceroots' parameter to provide the source directory, a file is created with a .jar extension. However, this file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The resulting file is not a valid jar file.", "EB": "I expect that when using the 'ajc' command with the 'outjar' parameter, the output file should be a valid jar file. This means it should contain the required MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the 'ajc' command with the 'sourceroots' parameter to specify the source directory.\n2. Use the 'outjar' parameter to specify the output file location with a .jar extension.\n3. Verify that the resulting file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
