{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "The software currently emits the bytecode instead of handling duplicate javaagent entries gracefully.", "EB": "It would be better if AspectJ detected that it was specified more than once and gave a warning, then disabled all but one of the agents.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Add duplicate javaagent entries to the VM startup commands.\n2. Run the software.\n3. Observe that the software emits the bytecode instead of handling the duplicate entries gracefully."}
