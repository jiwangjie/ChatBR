{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The output file created by the 'ajc' command does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, even though there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file present in the project directory.", "OB": "When using the 'ajc' command with the 'sourceroots' and 'outjar' parameters to compile and package source files into a JAR file, the resulting JAR file does not include the expected MANIFEST.MF file. This makes the generated JAR file invalid.", "EB": "The 'ajc' command with the 'outjar' parameter should create a valid JAR file, which includes a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce:1. Call the 'ajc' command with the 'sourceroots' parameter specifying the project directory.2. Use the 'outjar' parameter to specify the output file name with a .jar extension.3. Verify that the generated JAR file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, even though there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file present in the project directory."}
