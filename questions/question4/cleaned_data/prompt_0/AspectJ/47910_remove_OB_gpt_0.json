{"id": "47910", "title": "ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using the 'outjar' option with ajc, the resulting jar file does not contain the expected MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' argument followed by 'outjar' and specify an output file with a .jar extension, a jar file is created. However, upon inspection, the generated jar file does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file, which should be present in a valid jar file.", "EB": "If the 'outjar' option is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file, which means it should contain the required MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Use the 'ajc' command with the 'sourceroots' argument to specify the source roots.\n2. Include the 'outjar' option followed by a valid jar file name.\n3. Verify that the generated jar file contains the MANIFEST.MF file."}
