However, when selecting the other after advice statement, I see no joinpoints. Additionally, when I select the marker for either piece of after advice, I see all the joinpoints for both pieces of advice.", "EB": "The cross reference view should only display the joinpoints relevant to the selected after advice statement. Selecting one after advice statement should not affect the visibility of joinpoints associated with the other after advice statement. Similarly, selecting a marker should only display the joinpoints for the corresponding piece of after advice.", "SR": "Build ID: M200902111700\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1.
