  "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path wrong in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]. See tests/new/binaryWarnings/ for code to reproduce the problem. Note that the tests may return false positives due to filename checking limitations in the harness verification of messages. (AJDT may omit filenames that make no sense to it.)",
  "OB": "In the declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that issue.",
