This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "When starting a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag and there is an aop.xml file defined, the system reacts poorly. It attempts to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits a massive amount of bytecode. If the script is wrapped twice, it can generate a duplicate.", "EB": "The system should handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully by failing and providing an error message instead of emitting excessive bytecode. It should detect and prevent duplicate javaagent entries from causing issues.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start a Java 5 VM. \n2. Specify AspectJ's loadtime weaver twice using the javaagent flag. \n3. Ensure there is an aop.xml file defined. \n4. Observe the system's reaction and the generated bytecode."}
