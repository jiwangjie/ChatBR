  "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]. See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to reproduce the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I observed it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)",
  "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. I have also seen filenames not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.",
  "EB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Check declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars.\n3. Observe that the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."
