  "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path wrong in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]. See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)",
  "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. I have also seen the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main', and filenames should be displayed as expected.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. with the provided code.\n2. Observe the declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars and notice that the source path is displayed incorrectly as 'app.Main.class'.\n3. Note that in some cases, filenames may not appear at all in the declare warning messages."
