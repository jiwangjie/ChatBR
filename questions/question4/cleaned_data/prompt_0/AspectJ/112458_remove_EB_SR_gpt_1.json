  "title": "Bug 37021 - Source Path Incorrect in Declare Warning on Binary Files",
  "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path is wrong in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]. See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)",
  "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. I have also seen the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath should be listed in the form 'app/Main.class' instead of 'app.Main.class'. The filenames should also be consistently displayed in the warnings.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the tests located in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'.\n2. Observe the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.\n3. Note that the sourcepath is incorrectly formatted as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."
