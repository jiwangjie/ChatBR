{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode. This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "When starting a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified multiple times using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, the application encounters a severe error. It attempts to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits a large amount of bytecode.", "EB": "The application should handle duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully. Instead of attempting to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emitting excessive bytecode, it should fail gracefully and provide an error message to the user.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start a Java 5 VM with the AspectJ loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag. \n2. Ensure that there is an aop.xml file defined. \n3. Observe the application choking badly and emitting massive amounts of bytecode."}
