This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- A directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n- The test.class file is put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory.\n- Running the java command results in the following error:\n    Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- Compiling with ajc should not create an additional \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Compile the class using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nPlease note that running the java command should not result in any errors.", "OB": "The test.class is then put in subpackage\\subpackage directory. This means running java command results in Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test.\n\nRunning either of the following command fixes the problem: ajc -d .", "EB": "Compiling with ajc should not create an additional \"subpackage\" directory.", "SR": "Compile the class using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java"}
