{"id": "151938", "title": "Bug 151938 Handle Duplicate javaagent entries more gracefully", "description": "Failing that, it would be better to fail and give an error message than emit the bytecode.This issue came up for our automated installer, which adds a javaagent flag to VM startup commands. We are making our scripts more intelligent to avoid this issue, but we are probably not the only people who will hit this issue (e.g., if someone manually edits both setclasspath.bat and catalina.bat to add the flag for a Tomcat instance...)", "OB": "When starting a Java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, if there is an aop.xml file defined, it chokes badly. It tries to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emits massive amounts of bytecode.", "EB": "AspectJ should detect when its loadtime weaver is specified more than once using the javaagent flag. It should give a warning message and disable all but one of the agents.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, start a Java 5 VM and specify AspectJ's loadtime weaver more than once using the javaagent flag. Ensure there is an aop.xml file defined. Observe how it chokes, trying to reweave the woven AspectJ code and emitting massive amounts of bytecode."}
