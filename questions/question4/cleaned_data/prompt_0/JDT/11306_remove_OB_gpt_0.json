{"id": "11306", "title": "Bug 11306 - New class wizard launches simple project wizard", "description": "Since there are no existing projects, the dialog prompts the user to create a new project. This is very handy.", "OB": "When pressing the 'New Class' button in the Java perspective of a new workspace, the resulting dialog is the first page of the generic new project wizard.", "EB": "However, if the user answers 'yes' to create a new project, the Java Class wizard should open the Java Project wizard instead of the generic new project wizard.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open a new workspace. 2. Go to the Java perspective. 3. Press the 'New Class' button."}
