{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder to a bin directory, the system should confirm that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt properly.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory that contains additional files besides .class files.\n3. Confirm if the system prompts a confirmation message when attempting to delete and rebuild the bin directory."}
