{"id": "10654", "title": "Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point to the whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to the build path. This would be analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher where you can specify the system property java.ext.dirs to point to a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath. This feature suggested itself to me after using a class contained in the WebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0).", "OB": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to allow the use of a classpath variable to specify a whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to the build path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the build path configuration settings.\n2. Attempt to add jar files to the build path using a classpath variable.\n3. Notice that you have to specify each jar file separately, even if they are in the same directory."}
