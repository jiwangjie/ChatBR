  "title": "Bug 13189 - Refactoring: Deleting fields, context menu is overridden by message dialog",
  "description": "20020409I on LinuxMotif and w2k:1. Setup JUnit2.",
  "OB": "When I open TestCase.java and right-click on 'fName' in the outliner, instead of the expected context menu for refactoring options, a message dialog appears, preventing me from deleting the field as intended.",
  "EB": "I expect that when I right-click on 'fName' in the outliner of TestCase.java, the context menu should provide options for refactoring, including the ability to delete the field. The message dialog should not override this behavior.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set up JUnit.\n2. Enable the option 'Code Generator: Remove prefix from field names'.\n3. Open the file 'TestCase.java'.\n4. In the outliner, right-click on 'fName'."
