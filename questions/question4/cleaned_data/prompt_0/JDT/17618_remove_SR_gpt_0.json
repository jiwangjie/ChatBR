{"id": "17618", "title": "Changing output location should delete all derived resources", "description": "", "OB": "When creating a project with autobuild enabled, importing Java sources and resources, and then changing the output folder to project/bin, all class files are successfully removed. Changing the output folder back to the project also removes all class files. However, when opening the project/bin folder, all resources are still present. It is worth noting that these resources are tagged as 'Derived' when viewing the properties dialog.", "EB": "When changing the output location, all derived resources should be deleted. This means that when the output location is reverted to the project, all class files and resources should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project with autobuild enabled. \n2. Import Java sources and resources. \n3. Change the output folder to project/bin. \n4. Observe that all class files are removed, but resources remain in the project/bin folder."}
