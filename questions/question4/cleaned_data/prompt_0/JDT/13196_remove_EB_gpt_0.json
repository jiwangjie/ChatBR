  "OB": "When manipulating the source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browser perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference. The issue occurs as follows:\n1) Open Java Browsing Perspective.\n2) Select a type.\n3) Select a method in the method list view.\n4) Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view. The editor becomes dirty (ok).\n5) Select another type.\n6) Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7) Select a method in the method list view.\n8) Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view. As a result, the method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared. It's important to note that this issue does not occur when the editor is already in a dirty state.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the software should consistently handle the deletion of methods, whether in the type hierarchy or the method list view. It should not clear the type list view, method list view, and editor when a method is deleted from the hierarchy view or exhibit different behavior depending on the editor's state.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1) Open the Java Browsing Perspective.\n2) Select a type.\n3) Select a method in the method list view.\n4) Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view, resulting in the editor becoming dirty (ok).\n5) Select another type.\n6) Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7) Select a method in the method list view.\n8) Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view. Observe that the method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared. Please keep in mind that this issue does not occur when the editor is already in a dirty state."
