{"id": "10654", "title": "Bug 10654: Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path", "description": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory. This can be time-consuming and inconvenient. It would be more efficient if there was a feature that allowed all jars in a folder to be added to the build path with a single action. Currently, I had to manually search for the missing classes in the jar files and add them one by one. I believe bug 3887 may refer to this feature, but I couldn't find a specific bug report or feature request for it.", "OB": "The user has to manually add individual jar files from a directory to the build path when using classpath variables.", "EB": "The software should allow all jar files in a folder to be added to the build path with a single action, instead of requiring the user to add them individually.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the build path configuration.\n3. Add a classpath variable.\n4. Specify a folder containing multiple jar files.\n5. Observe that the software does not offer an option to add all jar files in the folder to the build path at once."}
