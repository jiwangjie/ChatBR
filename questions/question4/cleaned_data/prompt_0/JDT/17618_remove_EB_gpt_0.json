However, changing the output folder back to the project does not delete the class files. When opening the properties dialog for these files in project/bin, they are tagged as 'Derived'. ", "EB": "When changing the output folder back to the project, all class files should be removed, including any derived resources. Opening the project/bin folder should not show any class files or derived resources.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1) Create a project with autobuild enabled\n2) Import Java sources and resources\n3) Change the output folder to project/bin\n4) All class files should be removed\n5) Change the output folder back to the project\n6) All class files should be removed\n7) Open the project/bin folder and verify that there are no class files or derived resources."}
