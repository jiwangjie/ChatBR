This bug report provides an example class to demonstrate the issue. The programmer needs to add a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method to correct the program. Steps to reproduce the bug:\n\n1. Call the 'baz' method in the 'bar' method with 'x.foo()' as a parameter.\n\nInstead of giving 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())', the code assist should give 'baz(x.foo())'.\n\n\npublic class X {\n void bar(X x) {\n  baz(x.foo());\n }\n int foo() {\n  return 5;\n }\n void baz(int i, int j) {\n }\n}", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\nbaz(x.foo())", "EB": "The code assist should return 'baz(x.foo())' instead of 'baz(x.foo().foo())'.", "SR": "1. Call the 'baz' method in the 'bar' method with 'x.foo()' as a parameter."}
