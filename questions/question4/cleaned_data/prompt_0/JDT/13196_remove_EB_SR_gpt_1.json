  "OB": "When manipulating the source in the Java Browsing Perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference observed from the user's perspective. The issue occurs as follows:\n1) Open the Java Browsing Perspective.\n2) Select a type in the perspective.\n3) Select a method in the method list view.\n4) Delete the selected method using the context menu of the method list view. This action makes the editor dirty, which is expected behavior.\n5) Select another type in the perspective.\n6) Open the type hierarchy on this new type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7) Select a method in the method list view within the hierarchy view.\n8) Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view. Unexpectedly, the method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared. Note that this issue doesn't occur when the editor is dirty.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a method is deleted in the hierarchy view of the Java Browsing Perspective, it should not result in the deletion of the method on the file system, and it should not clear the type list view, method list view, or the editor. This behavior should be consistent with the case when the editor is dirty.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1) Open the Java Browsing Perspective.\n2) Select a type in the perspective.\n3) Select a method in the method list view.\n4) Delete the selected method using the context menu of the method list view (this will make the editor dirty).\n5) Select another type in the perspective.\n6) Open the type hierarchy on this new type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7) Select a method in the method list view within the hierarchy view.\n8) Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view. Observe that the method is unexpectedly deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared."
