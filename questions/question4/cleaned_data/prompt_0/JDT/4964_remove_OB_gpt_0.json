{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the code assist feature, the system automatically suggests completing the code, but it does not choose the correct suggestion based on context. Instead, it selects the first suggestion in the list.", "EB": "The code assist feature should be smarter in suggesting completions and should consider the context of the code being written. It should prioritize suggestions that match the typed text and are more relevant to the current context, such as \"dispose()\" in this case.", "SR": "1. Launch the application and open the code editor.\n2. Start typing a method call, e.g. \"button.dispose\".\n3. Observe that the code assist list appears automatically.\n4. Without looking at the code assist list, continue typing the desired method name, e.g. \"button.dispose\".\n5. Note that the incorrect suggestion from the code assist is auto-inserted in the code.\n6. Delete the incorrect insertion and manually type the correct method name."}
