{"id": "16822", "title": "Bug 16822: Search results not removed when 'cu' is moved", "description": "Build 200205211.", "OB": "When X.java is moved to 'P/src2', the search result remains in the search view. A double-click on the search result opens a 'Search Error' dialog with the message: 'An error occurred while creating a Java element. Reason: X.java does not exist.'", "EB": "After moving X.java to 'P/src2', the search results should be automatically removed from the search view to avoid confusion and prevent 'Search Error' dialogs from appearing when double-clicking on the search result.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Move X.java to 'P/src2'.\n2. Open the search view.\n3. Perform a search that includes X.java.\n4. Observe that the search result for X.java is still present in the search view.\n5. Double-click on the search result and note the appearance of the 'Search Error' dialog with the message 'An error occurred while creating a Java element. Reason: X.java does not exist.'"}
