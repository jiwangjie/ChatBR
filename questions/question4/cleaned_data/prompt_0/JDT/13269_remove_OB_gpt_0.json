{"id": "13269", "title": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager. Same goes for '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. 20020409. JRT.", "OB": "When exporting a JAR file and selecting a '.jardesc' file that already exists in the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' option, and then choosing 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and selecting a manifest file that also already exists, the jarpackager fails to complete its operation. An error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed, because saving manifest to workspace failed and saving description to workspace failed. However, if you click okay, you will return to the wizard and find that the .jar file was actually created.", "EB": "Either way, not overwriting the .jardesc file should not cause the wizard to fail and not complete its operation. The 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not save a new manifest file.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1) Select some packages and export as a JAR file.\n2) In the 'Export java source files and resources' option, choose 'Next'.\n3) In 'Save description of this JAR in workspace', select a .jardesc file that already exists and choose 'Next'.\n4) In the 'Use existing manifest from workspace' option, choose a manifest file that already exists (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n5) Choose 'Finish'.\n6) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n7) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\n8) Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed, because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. If you click 'OK', you will return to the wizard.\n9) Choose 'Cancel'.\n10) Go to where your .jar file was supposed to be generated and note that it was indeed created."}
