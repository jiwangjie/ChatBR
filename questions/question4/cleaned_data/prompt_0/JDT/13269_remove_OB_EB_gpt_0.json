{"id": "13269", "title": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager", "description": "Bug 13269: There is an incorrect operation order in the jarpackager. The same issue occurs for the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file, rather than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. 20020409. JRT.", "OB": "When following the steps provided, an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. Clicking okay will return the user to the wizard. Additionally, even though an error occurred, a .jar file is generated at the expected location.", "EB": "The wizard should handle the operation order correctly and not generate a JAR file or display an error message if the manifest and description files cannot be saved to the workspace.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Select some packages and export a JAR.\n2. Select 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3. Click 'Next'.\n4. In the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' field, choose a .jardesc file that already exists.\n5. Click 'Next'.\n6. Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest file that already exists (this step is easiest if you have run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n7. Click 'Finish'.\n8. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n9. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\n10. Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. Click 'Okay' to return to the wizard.\n11. Choose 'Cancel'.\n12. Go to the location where your .jar file was expected to be generated and note that it was indeed created."}
