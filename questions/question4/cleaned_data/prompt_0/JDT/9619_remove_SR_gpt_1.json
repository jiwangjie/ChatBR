  "description": "Bug 9619 - Move static member: Dialog details 20020212a. Mnemonicsb. No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g.",
  "OB": "1. The browse button is too small; consider using SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\n2. The title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found.' Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\n3. The destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudochanges in all referencing classes.",
  "EB": "1. I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx.'\n2. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.",
  "SR": "1. Click on the browse button and observe its size.\n2. Navigate to the next page in the dialog and note the displayed message about 'Type not found.' Ensure only types from the source folders of the own project are shown.\n3. Attempt to set the destination type as the source type and observe the refactoring warning and changes in referencing classes."
