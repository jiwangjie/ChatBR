However, this is incorrect behavior. As a result, the user interface closes the class file editors that are open for this jar. Closing the class file editors is the correct action for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH delta, but not for this case. I attempted to fix the delta to be an (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, but the user interface did not react as expected.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open Build 20020416.\n2.
