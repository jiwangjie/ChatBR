{"id": "17703", "title": "Bug 17703 - Edit/Add Task action should use Workbench dialog as Java Editor does", "description": "", "OB": "When using the Edit/Add Task action, the current behavior is not consistent with the Java Editor. Instead of using the Workbench dialog, a different dialog is used by default.", "EB": "The Edit/Add Task action should use the Workbench dialog, just like the Java Editor does. This will provide a consistent experience for users.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the Edit menu.\n3. Select the Add Task option.\n4. Observe that a dialog different from the Workbench dialog is displayed. This is the incorrect behavior.\n5. Repeat the same steps in the Java Editor.\n6. Observe that the Java Editor uses the Workbench dialog.\n7. This demonstrates the inconsistency in behavior between the Edit/Add Task action and the Java Editor. \nExpected result: The Edit/Add Task action should use the Workbench dialog, similar to the Java Editor."}
