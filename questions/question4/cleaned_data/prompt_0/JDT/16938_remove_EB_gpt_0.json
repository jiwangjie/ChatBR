{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "20020521 (F1)(This may not be a debug PRI wasn't sure). So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb. ", "OB": "When debugging a Java file and stepping into a println call, a Class File Editor opens. When clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow, the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. When clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time, the editor only scrolls about a line at a time instead of a page at a time. However, scrolling by grabbing the thumb and dragging it works well.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should provide more natural scrolling behavior. When clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow, it should scroll more than one pixel at a time. When clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time, it should scroll more than about a line at a time.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Put a breakpoint in a Java file, right before a System.out.println statement.\n2. Debug to the breakpoint and step into the println call.\n3. A Class File Editor opens.\n4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow and observe that the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time.\n5. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time and observe that the editor only scrolls about a line at a time instead of a page at a time.\n\nTo workaround the issue, grab the thumb of the scrollbar and scroll by dragging it."}
