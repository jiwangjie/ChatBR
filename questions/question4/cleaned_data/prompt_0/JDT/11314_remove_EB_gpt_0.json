{"id": "11314", "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller", "description": "", "OB": "In the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), when entering 'com.ibm.foobar' it is replaced with 'co~.ib~.foobar'. This behavior is unexpected as package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. In this example, 'com.' should not be replaced since 'co~.' has the same length and contains less information.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the application and navigate to the preferences section.\n2. Locate the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field.\n3. Enter 'com.ibm.foobar' in the field.\n4. Observe that it is replaced with 'co~.ib~.foobar', which is unexpected."}
