{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "20020521 (F1)(This may not be a debug PRI wasn't sure). So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.", "OB": "The Class File Editor in the software only scrolls about a line at a time instead of scrolling a page at a time.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll one line at a time when clicking on the arrows or clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time.", "SR": "1. Put a breakpoint in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement. \n2. Debug to the breakpoint. \n3. Step in to the println call (I happened to go into StringBuffer first, all that matters is that you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into). \n4. A Class File Editor opens. \n5. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow.\n\nExpected behavior: The editor should scroll one line at a time.\n\n6. Click on the scrollbar's background.\n\nExpected behavior: The editor should scroll a page at a time.\n\nNote: Grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well."}
