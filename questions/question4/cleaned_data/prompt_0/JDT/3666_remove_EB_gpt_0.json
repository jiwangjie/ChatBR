{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature eats too much code. Consider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the 'baz' call in 'bar' to make the program correct.", "OB": "The code is changed to: 'baz(x.foo().foo())'. I would rather it gave me 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code assist should only replace the specified code portion and not eat additional code. It should provide accurate suggestions for completing the code.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Change the 'baz' call to 'baz(x.x.foo())'.\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'.\n3. Use the Ctrl+Space shortcut to bring up the code assist.\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list.\n5. Select 'foo()'.\n6. Observe the code replacement."}
