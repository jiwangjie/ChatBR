{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When users create a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or check to ensure that the output directory ('bin' directory) can be deleted and rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a directory that contains more than just '.class' files, which can be rebuilt from the available '.java' files.", "EB": "When creating a new project, the system should prompt the user to confirm the deletion and rebuilding of the output directory ('bin' directory) if it is already present. The confirmation should explain that any existing files in the output directory will be permanently deleted, and the directory will be recreated to contain only the newly compiled '.class' files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new project.\n2. Set the output folder of the project to a directory that contains additional files besides the '.class' files.\n3. Confirm the creation of the project. The system should proceed without displaying any warnings or checks for the existing output directory."}
