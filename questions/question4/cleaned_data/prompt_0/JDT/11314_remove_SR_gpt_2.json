  "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "In the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), com.ibm.foobar is replaced with co~.ib~.foobar. I believe that package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. Thus, 'com.' would not be replaced in this example, since 'co~.' is the same length and contains less info.",
  "EB": "In the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), com.ibm.foobar should not be replaced with co~.ib~.foobar if the compressed name is not smaller. Thus, 'com.' should not be replaced in this example, since 'co~.' is the same length and contains less info.",
  "SR": "1. Open the preferences in the Java Work in progress environment.\n2. Navigate to the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field.\n3. Enter 'com.ibm.foobar' as the original package name.\n4. Observe that it is replaced with 'co~.ib~.foobar', even though the compressed name is not smaller."
