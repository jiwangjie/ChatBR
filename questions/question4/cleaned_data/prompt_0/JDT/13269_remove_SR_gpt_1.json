  "description": "Bug 13269 - Incorrect operation order in jarpackager. The same issue exists for the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. (Date: 20020409. JRT.)",
  "OB": "The issue at hand is that the jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen. Additionally, the messages 'saving manifest file failed' might be incorrect in this case, as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file (thus it is not really a failure).",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that not overwriting the manifest file should not cause the wizard to fail in completing its operation. Furthermore, the 'use existing manifest from the workspace' option should not save a new manifest file.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use the jarpackager wizard to create a jar file.\n2. Select the option to 'use existing manifest from workspace'.\n3. Do not choose to overwrite the manifest file when prompted."
