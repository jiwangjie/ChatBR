It is unclear that selecting 'Y' in the dialog will result in the removal of item 'X'.", "EB": "Normally, the 'Update' action should display the existing content (directory or zip file) and allow for modifications. To address this issue, I suggest renaming the action, as well as the dialog, to 'Recreate Test Suite' to clarify the functionality.", "SR": ""}
