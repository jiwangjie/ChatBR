{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after setting the output location and classpath, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations, and setting the output location creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Similar to the validation process, which checks the classpath and output location at once, setting the classpath and output location should be combined into a single operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software \n2. Go to the settings page \n3. Set the output location \n4. Set the classpath \n5. Press 'Ok' and observe the error message"}
