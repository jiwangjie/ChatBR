{"id": "14113", "title": "Should listen to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas", "description": "The current behavior is that when one changes the attached source of a jar, a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired, which is incorrect. As a result, the UI reacts by closing the class file editors opened on this jar, which is expected for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when trying to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not react.", "OB": "Currently, changing the attached source of a jar triggers a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta, causing the UI to close class file editors opened on the jar.", "EB": "When changing the attached source of a jar, a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) java delta should be triggered, and the UI should react accordingly by keeping the class file editors open.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Change the attached source of a jar. 2. Observe the firing of a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. 3. Attempt to change the delta to a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) java delta and observe the lack of reaction from the UI."}
