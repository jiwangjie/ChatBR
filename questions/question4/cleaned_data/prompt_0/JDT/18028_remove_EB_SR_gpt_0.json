If any resources are found to be read-only, the renaming operation should be blocked or an appropriate error message should be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Create a package with a Class Unit (CU) in it.\n2. Make the CU read-only (non-writeable).\n3. Attempt to rename the package.\n\nObserve that after the renaming process finishes, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed."}
