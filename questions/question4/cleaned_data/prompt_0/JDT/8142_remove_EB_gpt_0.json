The bug report does not provide enough information to fully understand the issue.", "OB": "When selecting a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), I get the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. BTW, what does the message mean?", "EB": "When selecting a binary project, I should be able to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open a binary project in the system (e.g., org.apache.ant). 2. Attempt to view the scoped type hierarchy (e.g., by pressing F4) and observe the message."}
