{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "The setting of classpath and output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process (checking classpath and output location at once). Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n 2. In the project properties, change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
