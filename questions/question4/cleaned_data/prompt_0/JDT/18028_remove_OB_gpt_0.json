If any resource is read-only, the user should be notified and prevented from proceeding with the rename operation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software and create a new package.\n2. Inside the package, create a compilation unit (CU) file.\n3. Set the permissions of the CU file to read-only.\n4. Attempt to rename the package.\n5. Observe that after the rename operation finishes, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed."}
