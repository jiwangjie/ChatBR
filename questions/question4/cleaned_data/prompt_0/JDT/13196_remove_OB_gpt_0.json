{"id": "13196", "title": "Bug 13196[Browsing] Consequences of changes", "description": "Bug 13196[Browsing] Consequences of changes ", "OB": "When manipulating the source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browser perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference. If the editor is dirty, deleting a method from the method list view in the Java Browsing Perspective also marks the editor as dirty. However, if the editor is not dirty, deleting a method from the hierarchy view in the same perspective does not mark the editor as dirty. Additionally, deleting a method from the hierarchy view also deletes the method from the file system, as well as clears the type list view, method list view, and the editor.", "EB": "Both manipulations, deleting a method from the method list view and deleting a method from the hierarchy view, should behave the same. If there is an open editor, all manipulations should just work on the working copy shown in the editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1) Open Java Browsing Perspective\n2) Select a type\n3) Select a method in the method list view\n4) Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view\n    - Observe that the editor becomes dirty (if the editor was not already dirty)\n5) Select another type\n6) Open type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view\n7) Select a method in the method list view\n8) Select the same method in the hierarchy view\n9) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view\n    - Observe that the method is deleted from the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared\nNote: This issue does not occur when the editor is already dirty."}
