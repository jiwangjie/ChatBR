{"id": "13196", "title": "Bug 13196 - Unexpected behavioral difference in Browsing Perspective", "description": "Bug 13196 - Consequences of changes in the Browsing Perspective", "OB": "When manipulating the source in the type hierarchy and method list of the browser perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference. If the editor is dirty and the user follows the specified steps, the method is only deleted from the method list view.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the editor is dirty and the user follows the specified steps to delete a method from the hierarchy view, the method should be deleted from the method list view, editor, and file system as well.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open Java Browsing Perspective. \n2. Select a type. \n3. Select a method in the method list view. \n4. Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view. The editor becomes dirty. \n5. Select another type. \n6. Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view. \n7. Select a method in the method list view. \n8. Select the same method in the hierarchy view. \n9. Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view. Notice that the method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared, except when the editor is dirty."}
