Create a package with a compilation unit (CU) in it. \n2. Make the CU read-only. \n3. Try to rename the package. \n\nObserved Behavior: After finishing the renaming process, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "EB": "Expected Behavior: The system should include a precondition check to verify if there are any read-only files inside the package before allowing the renaming process.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Create a package with a compilation unit (CU) in it. \n2. Set the CU as read-only. \n3. Attempt to rename the package. \n\nNote: Ensure that the expected behavior is observed after applying the suggested fix."}
