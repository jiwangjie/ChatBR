However, no results are found for this search. It is important to note that the search does work when initiated through the context menu in the package view.", "EB": "The search functionality should first attempt to get the Java element and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the package view.\n2. Select a package or file within the package.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Select the 'Search' option.\n5. Note that the search is initialized with the fully qualified name, but no results are found for declarations.\n6. Now, try searching through the context menu in the package view and observe that it works as expected."}
