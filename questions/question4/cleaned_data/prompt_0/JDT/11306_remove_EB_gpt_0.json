{"id": "11306", "title": "Bug 11306: New class wizard launches simple project wizard", "description": "Since there are no existing projects, the dialog prompts the user to create a new project. This is very handy.", "OB": "When the user selects the 'New Class' button in the Java perspective of a new workspace, the new class wizard launches the simple project wizard instead. However, if the user answers 'yes' to create a new project, the resulting dialog is the first page of the generic new project wizard. The Java Class wizard should open the Java Project wizard instead.", "EB": "The Java Class wizard should open the Java Project wizard when selected from the 'New Class' button in the Java perspective.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n 1. Open a new workspace.\n 2. Switch to the Java perspective.\n 3. Press the 'New Class' button."}
