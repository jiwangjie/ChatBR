{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not (not all need to be in the context menu, but all must be reachable from the editor). It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu when I select text in the editor. It only becomes visible when I switch to the Outline view.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the context menu when I select text in the editor.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select text in the editor.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Observe that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not present.\n5. Switch to the Outline view.\n6. Select text in the editor again.\n7. Right-click to open the context menu.\n8. Observe that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is now visible."}
