{"id": "10593", "title": "Bug 10593: Jar export should add \".jar\" suffix if not specified", "description": "", "OB": "When using Build 20020228, if you select some files and export them using the jar export feature, and enter \"test\" as the jar name, it creates a jar file called \"test\". This behavior is incorrect.", "EB": "The jar export feature should automatically add the \".jar\" suffix to the jar file name if it is not specified. Therefore, when entering \"test\" as the jar name, it should create a jar file called \"test.jar\".", "SR": "To reproduce, follow these steps:\n1. Use Build 20020228.\n2. Select some files.\n3. Export the selected files using the jar export feature.\n4. Enter \"test\" as the jar name.\n5. Verify that it creates a jar file called \"test.jar\"."}
