{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "Bug 6322: The All Types dialog in JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) etc.", "OB": "When using JDK 1.4, the All Types dialog displays obfuscated class names such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc.", "EB": "The obfuscated class names should be less prominent and the display should prioritize non-obfuscated class names.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the All Types dialog in JDK 1.4. \n2. Observe the presence of obfuscated class names like 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc. \n3. Note that these obfuscated class names are displayed in the dialog. \n\nPossible steps to resolve the issue: \na) Sort lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter. \nb) Filter out obfuscated class names completely from the dialog. \n\nSuggestion: I recommend implementing option 'a', sorting lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter."}
