{"id": "16938", "title": "Bug 16938DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally", "description": "20020521 (F1)(This may not be a debug PRI wasn't sure). So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.", "OB": "The Class File Editor only scrolls one pixel at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow, and about a line at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background. The expected behavior is for the editor to scroll a page at a time in both cases.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow, and when clicking on the background, instead of scrolling one pixel or about a line at a time.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Put a breakpoint in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement.\n2. Debug to the breakpoint and step into the println call (it doesn't matter if you go into StringBuffer first, the important thing is that you don't have the source for the class you just stepped into).\n3. A Class File Editor opens.\n4. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow.\n   - Observed behavior: The editor only scrolls one pixel at a time.\n5. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll.\n   - Observed behavior: The editor only scrolls about a line at a time.\n\nExpected behavior: The editor should scroll a page at a time in both cases.\n\nAnother way to move through the editor is by grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that, which currently works well."}
