{"id": "4329", "title": "No results when searching via Package view selection and dialog", "description": "When searching via Package view selection and dialog, no results are returned.", "OB": "The package view initializes the Search dialog with the fully qualified name. However, when searching for declarations, the search does not find any results. It should first try to get the Java element and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name. The search works fine when performed through the context menu in the packages view.", "EB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, the search should return the expected results. The search process should first attempt to retrieve the Java element, and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Package view. \n2. Select a package. \n3. Open the Search dialog from the context menu or any other way that initializes the dialog with the fully qualified name. \n4. Enter a search term for declarations. \n5. Check if any results are returned. \n\nThe expected behavior is that the search should return the relevant declarations based on the search term entered."}
