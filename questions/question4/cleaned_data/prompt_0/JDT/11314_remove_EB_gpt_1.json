  "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "In the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), com.ibm.foobar is replaced with co~.ib~.foobar. I believe that package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. Thus com. would not be replaced in this example, since co~. is the same length and contains less info.",
  "EB": "The package name compression feature should replace a fragment only if the compressed name is smaller than the original. In the provided example, the 'com.' fragment should not be replaced since 'co~.' is of the same length and contains less information.",
  "SR": "Build 20020214. To reproduce the issue, enter '2~.' in the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences."
