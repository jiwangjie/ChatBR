However, attempting to double-click on the search result opens a 'Search Error' dialog which states that an error occurred while creating a Java element. The reason given is that X.java does not exist.", "EB": "When X.java is moved to a different source folder, the search result for its declaration should be automatically removed from the search view.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a project P with 2 source folders 'src1' and 'src2'.\n2. Create a compilation unit (cu) X.java under 'P/src1' with the following content:\npublic class X {}\n3.
