This causes the UI to close the class file editors opened on the jar, which is the expected behavior for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH delta. However, when trying to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not react.", "EB": "In this case, the class file editor should be refreshed to get the new source. I suggest firing a (FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH | FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, and removing the FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH when this bug is fixed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: Build 20020416, change the attached source of a jar and observe the fired delta and the UI reaction."}
