After the renaming process is completed, an unexpected exception dialog is displayed.", "EB": "The software should check if all resources, including the compilation unit, are writeable before allowing the renaming of a package. If any resource is marked as readonly, the software should prevent the renaming process and display an appropriate error message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a package with a compilation unit.\n2. Make the compilation unit readonly.\n3. Attempt to rename the package.\n4. Observe the unexpected exception dialog after the renaming process is completed."}
