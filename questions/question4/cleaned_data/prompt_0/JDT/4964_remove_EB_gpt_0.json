{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since `DISPOSED` is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with `button.DISPOSED`, which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a `(` and that this matches `dispose()` far better than `DISPOSED`. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: `button.dispose`. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: `DISPOSED` and `intWidgetdispose()voidWidget`. I then type `(` because the line I was typing was supposed to be: `button.dispose();`. But as soon as I type the `(`, then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "Code assist should recognize that when I type `button.dispose(`, the most likely completion is `dispose()`. It should prioritize this option over other options, such as `DISPOSED` or `intWidgetdispose()voidWidget`. Additionally, code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting completions.", "SR": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, follow these steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Type `button.dispose`.\n2. Without looking at the code assist list, proceed to type `(` to complete the line as `button.dispose();`"}
