JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc.", "OB": "When using the Open Type dialog, the obfuscated classes ('a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') are prominently displayed.", "EB": "The Open Type dialog should not prominently display the obfuscated classes.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the Open Type dialog.\n2. Observe the prominent display of the obfuscated classes ('a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd').\n\nOptions to resolve the bug:\na) Sort the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter.\nb) Filter out the obfuscated classes completely.\n\nI suggest option 'a'."}
