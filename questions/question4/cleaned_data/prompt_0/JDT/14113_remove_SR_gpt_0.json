As a result, the UI closes the class file editors opened on this jar, which is the expected behavior for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta. However, when attempting to fix the delta to be an (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta, the UI does not react.", "EB": "In this case, I expect the UI to refresh the class file editor to display the new source. As a temporary solution, I will fire a (FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH | FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED) delta and remove the FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH when this bug is fixed.", "SR": ""}
