The behavior is confusing and it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually. Then, when executing the ShiftLeft operation, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). It should not be confusing and the text should shift properly.", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces.\n2. Execute ShiftLeft operation.\n3.
