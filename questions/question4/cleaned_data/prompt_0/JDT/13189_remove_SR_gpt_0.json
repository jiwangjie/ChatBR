Instead, a message dialog immediately prompts the user if they want to delete the getter/setter as well.", "EB": "When trying to delete fields using the context menu, the expected behavior is for the context menu to be displayed, allowing the user to choose the appropriate actions, including deleting the getter/setter if desired.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Setup JUnit. \n2. Attempt to delete fields using the context menu."}
