{"id": "11314", "title": "Bug 11314: Replace package name fragments should always be smaller", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "In the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), when replacing 'com.ibm.foobar' with 'co~.ib~.foobar', the compressed package name should always be smaller. Currently, it is being replaced even if the compressed name is larger. I believe that package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. Thus, the 'co~.ib~.foobar' package name fragment should not replace 'com.ibm.foobar'.", "SR": ""}
