Double-clicking on the search result shows a 'Search Error' dialog with the message 'An error occurred while creating a Java element. Reason: X.java does not exist.'", "EB": "The search result for a source file should be automatically removed from the search view when the file is moved to a different folder. Double-clicking on the search result should open the file without any error.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project P with 2 source folders 'src1' and 'src2'.\n2. Create a compilation unit X.java under 'P/src1':\n   public class X {}\n3. Perform a search for the declaration of X.\n4. Move X.java to 'P/src2'.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The search result for X.java should be removed from the search view.\n- Double-clicking on the search result should open the file without any error."}
