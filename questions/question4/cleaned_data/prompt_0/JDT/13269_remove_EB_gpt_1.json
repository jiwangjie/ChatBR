  "description": "Bug 13269: Incorrect operation order in jarpackager. Same goes for '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. 20020409. JRT.",
  "OB": "The issue arises because the jar file is created before the overwrite verifications happen. Other notes: The message 'saving manifest file failed' is perhaps incorrect in this case as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file (thus it is not really a failure).",
  "EB": "The jarpackager should prompt for overwrite verification before creating the jar file. Additionally, the error message 'saving manifest file failed' should accurately reflect the user's choice of not overwriting the manifest file, indicating it as a user decision rather than a failure.",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1) Select some packages and export jar.\n2) Select 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3) Click 'Next'.\n4) In 'Save description of this JAR in workspace,' choose a .jardesc that already exists.\n5) Click 'Next'.\n6) Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest that already exists (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n7) Click 'Finish'.\n8) A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n9) Another dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'. Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed because saving manifest to the workspace failed and saving description to the workspace failed. If you click 'Okay,' you will return to the wizard.\n10) Choose 'Cancel'. Go to where your .jar file was to have been generated and note that it was indeed created."
