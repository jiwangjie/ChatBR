This is very handy.", "OB": "When launching the new class wizard with no existing projects, the resulting dialog is the first page of the generic new project wizard.", "EB": "However, if the user answers yes, the Java Class wizard should open the Java Project wizard instead.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the application with no existing projects.\n2. Open the new class wizard.\n3. Follow the prompts and select 'Yes' when prompted to create a new project.\n4.
