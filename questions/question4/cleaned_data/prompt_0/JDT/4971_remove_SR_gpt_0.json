{"id": "4971", "title": "Bug 4971: Strange 'copy package'", "description": "When trying to perform a 'copy package' operation in the Eclipse JDT UI, I encountered a strange behavior. After selecting the source package 'xxx' and specifying 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui' as the destination, the copied package name should have been 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui'. However, the resulting package name was 'xx'.", "OB": "After the 'copy package' operation, the resulting package name is 'xx'.", "EB": "The expected result is that the resulting package name should be 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the Eclipse JDT UI.\n2. Select the package 'xxx' as the source.\n3. Specify 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui' as the destination.\n4. Perform the 'copy package' operation.\n5. Observe the resulting package name and confirm that it is 'xx' instead of 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui'."}
