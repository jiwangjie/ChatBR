{"id": "11863", "title": "Bug 11863: Update Test Suite action does not allow to remove", "description": "", "OB": "The 'Update Test Suite' action does not allow the removal of test cases. Currently, when the action is performed on a test suite that contains X test cases, the selection dialog only recreates the test suite based on the selection, without providing an option to remove any test cases.", "EB": "The 'Update Test Suite' action should provide the ability to remove test cases from the test suite. It should have a feature where users can select the test cases they want to remove in addition to those they want to keep.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the test suite that contains X test cases.\n2. Perform the 'Update Test Suite' action.\n3. Observe that the selection dialog does not allow the removal of any test cases.\n4. Expect the selection dialog to provide an option to remove test cases along with the ability to select the test cases to keep."}
