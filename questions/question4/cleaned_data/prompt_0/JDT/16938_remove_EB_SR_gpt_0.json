So the workaround, ifthe user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use thethumb. ", "OB": "When a breakpoint is put in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement and debug to the breakpoint, then step into the println call (I happened to go into StringBuffer first, all that matters is that you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into), a Class File Editor opens. When clicking on the scrollbar's down arrow, the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. When clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time, the editor only scrolls about a line at a time instead of scrolling a page at a time. However, grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.", "EB": "The Class File Editor should scroll more naturally, allowing users to scroll a page at a time when clicking on the scrollbar's background.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Put a breakpoint in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement.\n2. Debug to the breakpoint.\n3. Step into the println call (If necessary, step into any other class without its source code).\n4. A Class File Editor will open.\n5. Click on the scrollbar's down arrow and observe that the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time.\n6. Click on the scrollbar's background and observe that the editor only scrolls about a line at a time instead of scrolling a page at a time.\n7. Finally, grab the thumb and scroll with that to see that it works well."}
