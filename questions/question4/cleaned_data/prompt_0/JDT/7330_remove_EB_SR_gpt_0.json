I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions appear to be distributed according to personal preference, which should be changed. It is unclear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be accessible from the editor, without requiring users to switch views.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be available in the context menu and accessible from the editor without requiring users to switch views.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not present in the menu."}
