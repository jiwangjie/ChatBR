Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste and it is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without forcing the users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "1. Open the editor. \n2. Select a portion of the text. \n3. Right-click to open the context menu. \n4. Verify if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is present in the context menu. \n5. If the action is not present, switch to the Outline view and repeat steps 2-4."}
