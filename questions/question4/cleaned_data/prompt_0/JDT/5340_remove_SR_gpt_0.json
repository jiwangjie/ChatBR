{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "When cancelling the addition of an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog should honor the cancellation request. It should either stop the process or disable the cancel button. (When calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancellable parameter.)", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the exception breakpoint dialog. \n2. Add an exception breakpoint. \n3. Attempt to cancel the operation. \n\nExpected result: The progress dialog should either stop the process immediately or disable the cancel button, depending on the cancellation request."}
