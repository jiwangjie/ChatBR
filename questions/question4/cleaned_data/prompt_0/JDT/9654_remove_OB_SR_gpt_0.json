The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "EB": "The marking between the button and list should be reduced to an appropriate size. The top button should be aligned properly with the dialog top. The table should have a label to accommodate a mnemonic. The dialog should allow multiple selection, as the move up / down functionality can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview should be displayed as a label that wraps its content. Additionally, it would be beneficial for the signature preview to have its background color set to the same color as when it is hovered over.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1.
