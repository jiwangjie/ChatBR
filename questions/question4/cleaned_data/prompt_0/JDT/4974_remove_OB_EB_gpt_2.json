  "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When performing the specified steps, the classpath and output location settings are not updated as expected. The system still treats 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.",
  "EB": "I expect that when I follow the provided steps, the classpath and output location settings should be updated to use the project as both the source folder and the output location, effectively replacing 'src' and 'bin' for this project.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. In the project properties, change the setting to use the project as both the source folder and the output location."
