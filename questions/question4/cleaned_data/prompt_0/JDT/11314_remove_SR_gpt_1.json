  "title": "Bug 11314 - Replace package name fragments should always be smaller",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "In the 'Replace package name fragments with:' field in the preferences (Java Work in progress), com.ibm.foobar is replaced with co~.ib~.foobar. I believe that package name compression should only replace a fragment if the compressed name is actually smaller. Thus, com. would not be replaced in this example, since co~. is the same length and contains less info.",
