{"id": "17618", "title": "Changing output location should delete all derived resources", "description": "When changing the output folder of a project, all class files should be removed from the previous output folder. However, when changing the output folder back to the project folder, all class files are still removed, but the resources remain. This behavior seems to be inconsistent with the expected behavior.", "OB": "After importing Java sources and resources into a project and enabling the autobuild feature, changing the output folder to 'project/bin' removes all class files. When changing the output folder back to the project folder, all class files are removed as well, but the resources are not deleted. The resources are still accessible through the 'project/bin' directory, and they are labeled as 'Derived' when viewing the properties dialog for any of these resources.", "EB": "When changing the output folder of a project, all derived resources, including class files and resources, should be deleted from the previous output folder. Similarly, when changing the output folder back to the project folder, all derived resources, including class files and resources, should be deleted as well. This ensures consistency in removing all unused artifacts and prevents clutter in the project directories.", "SR": "1. Create a new project with 'autobuild' enabled.\n2. Import Java sources and resources into the project.\n3. Change the output folder to 'project/bin'.\n4. Verify that all class files are removed from the previous output folder.\n5. Change the output folder back to the project folder.\n6. Verify that all class files and resources are deleted from the previous output folder, leaving it empty.\n7. Open the 'project/bin' directory and confirm that all resources have been removed, with no leftover files.\nNote: To validate that a resource is derived, open the properties dialog for the resource and check if it is tagged as 'Derived'."}
