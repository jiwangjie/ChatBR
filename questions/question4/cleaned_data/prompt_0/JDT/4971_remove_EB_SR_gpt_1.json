  "description": "Bug 4971 occurs during 'copy package' in version 2031 of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui in jdt.ui. The issue is observed when selecting 'xxx' as the destination.",
  "OB": "Upon performing the 'copy package' operation, the destination 'xx' unexpectedly contains a package named 'ui'.",
