In order to get my code to compile, I had to add in several of the jar files from the WTE plugin directory. This involved manually searching through the jar files to find the missing classes and adding in the appropriate jars.", "EB": "It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point to the whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to the build path. This would be analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher where you can specify the system property 'java.ext.dirs' to point to a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath.", "SR": "To reproduce, add jar files to the build path using classpath variables and specify each jar file separately (including those in the same directory). Then, manually search through the jar files to find missing classes and add the appropriate jars."}
