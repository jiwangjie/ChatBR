We need to add support for page range in the RenderTask. If a page range is provided, we should parse it and output the specified pages one after another, with a page splitter in between, similar to the behavior of the runAndRenderTask method. If a single page number is provided, we should output only that page. Currently, if an invalid page number is set, an error message is not logged and returned. We need to log the invalid page number as an error and return an appropriate error message. Additionally, if neither a page range nor a page number is set, the default behavior should be to output all pages, instead of giving an error message.\", \"OB\": \"The code does not support specifying a page range in the RenderTask.
