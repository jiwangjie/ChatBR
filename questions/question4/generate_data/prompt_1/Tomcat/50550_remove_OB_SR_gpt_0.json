There is a similarity with bug 21288, which was fixed and titled 'DirContext caching problem with Dreamweaver 6 when recursively creating directories'. The issue can be reproduced using a jackrabbit client. The steps to reproduce are as follows:\\n\\n1. Create an instance of HttpClient.\\n2. Create a new directory URL with a unique identifier.\\n3. Make a PropFind request to the new directory URL (comment out this request to make the second PropFind successful).\\n4. Make a MkCol request to the new directory URL.\\n5.
