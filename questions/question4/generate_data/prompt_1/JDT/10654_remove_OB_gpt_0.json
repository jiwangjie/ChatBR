This process becomes cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when there are multiple jar files in a directory. It would be much more convenient if there was a feature to allow adding all jar files in a folder to the build path by using a classpath variable. This feature would be similar to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher, where you can specify the system property java.ext.dirs to point to a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath. The need for this feature arose after using a class contained in the WebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0).\", \n\"OB\": \"Currently, when adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, each jar file needs to be specified separately.
