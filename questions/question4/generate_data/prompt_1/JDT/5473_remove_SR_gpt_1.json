In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the position of the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab).

Currently, the ShiftLeft operation does not handle intermixed tabs and spaces correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior.
