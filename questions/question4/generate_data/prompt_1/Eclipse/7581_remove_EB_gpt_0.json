When editing objects in the property sheet, the ComboBoxCellEditor is used for a set of row that are name value pairs in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and this is used to create editors that include a ComboBoxCellEditor. The constructor of the ComboBoxCellEditor allows for the specification of strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the drop down button should appear at the right edge of the column. However, a problem occurs if any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. In this case, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item, causing the drop down button to be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in it being clipped. This negatively affects the user experience, as they can no longer see the combo drop down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.\", \n\"OB\": \"The ComboBoxCellEditor in the PropertySheetViewer does not size correctly in the property sheet.
