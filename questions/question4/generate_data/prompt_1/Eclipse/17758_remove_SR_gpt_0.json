Firstly, after importing all plugins from the runtime environment and packing a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant), the 'Go Into' action works fine. However, when going back and forth using the 'Go back' and 'Go up' actions, the first forward goes to a blank screen. Additionally, clicking the forward action doesn't seem to do anything, and the 'Go Into' action becomes disabled. Another issue is that even with some history, opening another project (e.g., org.eclipse.lucene) and selecting a folder (e.g., 'bin') still enables the 'Go Into' action.\", \n\"OB\": \"From a clean F1 build, import all plugins from the runtime environment and pack a project (e.g., org.eclipse.ant).
