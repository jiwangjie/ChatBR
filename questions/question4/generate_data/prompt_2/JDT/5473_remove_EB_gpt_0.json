Open a default text editor.\\n2. Type in the following lines:\\n   - Some text\\n   - Some text2\\n   Ensure that the first line starts with a tab character and the second line starts with spaces.\\n3. Highlight the two lines and execute the ShiftLeft command.\\n   Note that no text is moved.\\n\\nExpected Behavior: When the ShiftLeft command is executed in this scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab character). There should not be any stray spaces.\\n\\nThis behavior is currently confusing as it is not clear why the text does not shift.
