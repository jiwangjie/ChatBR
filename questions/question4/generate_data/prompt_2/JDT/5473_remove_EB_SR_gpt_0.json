It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but it is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be replaced with spaces). Additionally, having a stray space in the first line makes it even more confusing as the reason for the text not shifting is not obvious.\",\n\"EB\": \"\", \n\"SR\": \"\"}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 269, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 473}, "origin": {"input_prompt": "Your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.
