Currently, when forcing a redraw of the entire client area, the entire bidi segment is drawn with a selection background. However, it is not necessary to redraw the entire selection background anymore as there already exists code in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection. The problem lies in DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground, where the code to redraw the entire selection background does not take bidi segments (direction runs) into account. Therefore, the proper selection background should be drawn in StyledTextRenderer.drawStyledLine, taking bidi segments and tab stops into account.\", \"OB\": \"When forcing a redraw of the entire client area, the entire bidi segment is currently drawn with a selection background in DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackground.
