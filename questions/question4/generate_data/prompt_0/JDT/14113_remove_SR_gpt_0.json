Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '14113', 'title': 'Bug 14113Should listen to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas', 'description': 'Bug 14113Should listen to FSOURCEATTACHED and FSOURCEDETACHED java deltas ', 'OB': 'Build 20020416Right now, when one change the attached source of a jar, aFREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta is fired, which is obviously wrong.As a consequence, the UI reacts by closing the class file editors opened onthis jar, which is right for a FREMOVEDFROMCLASSPATH java delta.However I tried to fix the delta to be a (FSOURCEDETACHED | FSOURCEATTACHED)delta, but the UI would not react.
