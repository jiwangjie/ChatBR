Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '4964', 'title': 'Bug 4964Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter', 'description': 'Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, Iended up with:button.DISPOSEDwhich isn\\'t even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and startagain, paying more attention this time.Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\".Either that, or it needs to be case sensitivewhen it is automatically inserting stuff.
