Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '13196', 'title': 'Bug 13196[Browsing] Consequences of changes', 'description': 'Bug 13196[Browsing] Consequences of changes ', 'OB': '', 'EB': '', 'SR': \"From the user's perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference whenmanipulation source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browserperspective.1) open Java Browsing Perspective2) select a type3) select a method in the method list view4) delete the method (context menu of the method list view) editor becomes dirty (ok)5) select another type6) open type hierarchy on this type, dock the hierachy view7) select a method in the method list view8) select the same method in the hierarchy view9) delete the method (context menu of the hierarchy view) method is deleted on file system, type list view, method list view, editorare all clearedNote: This is not the case when the editor is dirty. \"}"}}
