Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '10654', 'title': 'Bug 10654Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path', 'description': 'Bug 10654Allow all jars in a folder to be added to build path ', 'OB': '', 'EB': 'It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point tothe whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to thebuild path.This would be analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher you can specify the system property java.ext.dirs to point to a list ofdirectories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath.This feature suggested itself to me after using a class contained in theWebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0).
