Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '121323', 'title': 'Bug 121323XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information', 'description': '', 'OB': \"Bug 121323XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information If one enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selectionpart like section[@id='left'] then within class RelationInformation theselection is stripped of and stored in filterInfo HashMap.When leaving the dialog, RelationInformation gets persited to .rptdesignbutdata stored in filterInfo is lost.HoweverIMHO treating XPath expressions in that way will lead to a lotof trouble. \", 'EB': '', 'SR': ''}"}}
