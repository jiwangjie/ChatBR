Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '118780', 'title': 'Bug 118780Set alias for columns in data set but in expression builder still shows the old columns name when select the dataset.', 'description': '', 'OB': '', 'EB': 'In the expression builder, select the dataset and double click the first column name.Expected result:According to scr 78193 in tracker, the first column in expression build should use alias name instead of original name.Actual result:The original name of the first column was listed in the below of expression builder but the alias name appeared above as row[\"column1\"] after double click the original name.
