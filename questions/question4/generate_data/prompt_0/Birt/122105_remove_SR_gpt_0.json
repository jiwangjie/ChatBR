Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '122105', 'title': \"Bug 122105the schema should be added as 'schemaname.Procedurename' when use the stored procedure.\", 'description': \"Bug 122105the schema should be added as 'schemaname.Procedurename' when use the stored procedure. \", 'OB': 'In the window \"Edit data set\", drag a store procedure to the QueryTextExpected Results:The stored procedure naming should be composed of the database schema name and the store procedure name ', 'EB': \"Description:the schema should be added as 'schemaname.Procedurename' when use the stored procedure.Steps to reproduce:1. create a new report2. \", 'SR': ''}"}}
