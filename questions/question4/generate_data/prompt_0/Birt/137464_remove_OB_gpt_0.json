Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '137464', 'title': \"Bug 137464apply a filter on a Join dataset in chart editor's select data page, the data preview part is not refresh\", 'description': '', 'OB': '', 'EB': 'chilck a filter with row[\"Data Set1::EMPLOYEEID\"] =1Actual result:look at the data preview after you apply the filter,you will find it haven\\'t change any more but the filter has effectEcepted result:the data preview should refresh after set a filter ', 'SR': \"Description:use the attach file.When apply a filter on a Join dataaset in chart editor's select data page, the data preview part is not refresh.Step to reproduce:1. open the attach file2. creat a chart and choose select data page3. use the Jiondataset and set the X Y series4. \"}"}}
