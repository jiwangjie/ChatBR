Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '49890', 'title': 'Bug 49890Nio Selector issue on linux platform', 'description': \"Bug 49890Nio Selector issue on linux platform Created attachment 25997 [details]NioEndpoint.java and simple web applicationsometimes ,server's cpu reaches 100%,and keep 100% all the time,until restartthe server.Reproduced with java versions: 1.6.007,1.6.018, 1.6.021.It is duplicate of issue: Bug 46373.It seams that Jetty guys fixed that problem: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel.I added some logging to NioEndpoint.java. \", 'OB': 'With this logging we can see that selector.select(timeout) sometimes return zero keys on linux plutform.
