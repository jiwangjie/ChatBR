Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '50550', 'title': 'Bug 50550PropFind 404 error after MkCol succes', 'description': 'Bug 50550PropFind 404 error after MkCol succes This suggests this has to do with caching.Note2: This situation sounds similar to call 21288 (FIXED\\'DirContext caching problem with Dreamweaver 6 when recursively creating directories\\').Reproducable using a jackrabbit client;HttpClient client = new HttpClient();String newDir = \"http://localhost:8080/webdav/output/\" + UUID.randomUUID() + \"/\";// Comment out this request to make second propfind succesfulHttpMethod propFindMethod1 = new PropFindMethod(newDir);client.executeMethod(propFindMethod1);propFindMethod1.releaseConnection();HttpMethod mkcolMethod = new MkColMethod(newDir);client.executeMethod(mkcolMethod);mkcolMethod.releaseConnection();HttpMethod propFindMethod = new PropFindMethod(newDir);client.executeMethod(propFindMethod);propFindMethod.releaseConnection(); ', 'OB': 'A propfind call on a resource returns a 404 error when executed after a mkcol for the same resource.
