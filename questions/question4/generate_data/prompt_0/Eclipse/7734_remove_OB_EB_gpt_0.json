Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '7734', 'title': 'Bug 7734System can be shut down without savefile warnings', 'description': '', 'OB': '', 'EB': '', 'SR': 'When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting downWindows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.Steps To Reproduce:start WSWB and create a new projectcreate a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.Notice thatthetext file is marked as a dirty fileLeft click on the Windows Start menu, select \u201cShut Down\u2026\u201d command to shutdown/reboot the computerResults:There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to savetheir dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.OtherWindows programs (like Word, Outlook etc. '}"}}
