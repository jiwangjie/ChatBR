Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '12906', 'title': 'Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] If file is already opened in one editor, cannot open in another editor (should give error msg)', 'description': 'Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] If file is already opened in one editor, cannot open in another editor (should give error msg) ', 'OB': '', 'EB': 'However, there shouldbe warning ', 'SR': \"Make sure you have an assoicate Windows editor for your java file.Ifnot, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and selectWordPad or notepadas default editor for all java files.In the Java Perspective, right click on the Java fileOpen With ..System Editor.A notepad and wordpad window will pop up with the javafile opened.
