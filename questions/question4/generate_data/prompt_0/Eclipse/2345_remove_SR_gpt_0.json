Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '2345', 'title': 'Bug 2345[Editor Mgmt] Open with a different type of editor has no effect if file already open (1GEWMSQ)', 'description': 'Bug 2345[Editor Mgmt] Open with a different type of editor has no effect if file already open (1GEWMSQ) ', 'OB': \"Reproduce the steps in: 1GEWMOZ: ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example opens on XML files by default new basic project new file test.xml the editor used is the scripted resource editor example, which totally ignores the XML file content select test.xml in Navigator choose Open With... / Default Text Editor nothing happens; it's reactivating the scripted resource editor exampleSearching for an existing open file should also consider editor types.It should open a new editor on the file, because the editor type is different.NOTES: \", 'EB': \"Reproduce the steps in: 1GEWMOZ: ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example opens on XML files by default new basic project new file test.xml the editor used is the scripted resource editor example, which totally ignores the XML file content select test.xml in Navigator choose Open With... / Default Text Editor nothing happens; it's reactivating the scripted resource editor exampleSearching for an existing open file should also consider editor types.It should open a new editor on the file, because the editor type is different.NOTES: \", 'SR': ''}"}}
