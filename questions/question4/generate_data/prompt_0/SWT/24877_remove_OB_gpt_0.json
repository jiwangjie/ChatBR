Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '24877', 'title': 'Bug 24877Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog', 'description': \"Bug 24877Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine thecorrect file extension to append to the file name. \", 'OB': '', 'EB': 'The export wizard should use thefile \"test.zip\" when this happens.STEPS:1) Select a java file2) Select FileExport...3) Select JAR file and press Next4) Press Browse... to select a Save As file dialog5) Enter test for the file name6) Select .zip for the \"Save as type\" field7) Press SaveResult:The JAR export wizard uses \"test\" for the JAR file field.Expected result:The JAR export wizard should use the \"test.zip\" for the JAR file field.
