Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '17825', 'title': 'Bug 17825ControlExampleText beeps when I choose SWT.MULTI', 'description': \"Bug 17825ControlExampleText beeps when I choose SWT.MULTI Somehow I don't think it's supposed todo that. \", 'OB': '', 'EB': \"I hear a windows 'ding' when Ido this (the bell sound that means you did something wrong). \", 'SR': \"Build F1 (20020521)Win2K(I'm not sure if this is SWT or just the SWT Example)In the SWT example ControlExample, under the Text tab, click on StylesSWT.SINGLE and then back on StylesSWT.MULTI. \"}"}}
