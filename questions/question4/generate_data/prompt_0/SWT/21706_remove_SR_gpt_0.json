Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '21706', 'title': 'Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage', 'description': 'Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage ', 'OB': 'Well, kind of.And so what if it does?OK, 2047 has a line in org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil of:static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);The BidiUtil.class is syntactic sugar for Class.forName(\"org...BidiUtil\").Theproblem with this is that method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is notdefined in the CLDC class libraries, which causes us a little problem in theCLDC version of SWT.You\\'d only see this problem if you verified or usedjxeLink or something; the compiler gens the call itself, and just assumesNoClassDefFoundError is around, so you won\\'t ever get a compiler error from theeclipse compiler (nor Sun\\'s compiler).So, I\\'d like this changed.Here\\'s the simplest way to change to remove thereflection.
