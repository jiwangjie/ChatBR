Avoid vague statements like \"the system does not work.\"\n- **Expected Behavior (EB):** This part should articulate what the software should or is expected to do, using phrases like \"should...\", \"expect...\", or \"hope...\". Avoid suggestions or recommendations for bug resolution in this section.\n- **Steps to Reproduce (SR):** Include user actions or operations that can potentially lead to reproducing the issue. Use phrases like \"to reproduce,\" \"steps to reproduce,\" or \"follow these steps.\"\nIt is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB, EB, and SR sections. In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements. Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.\nTo facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:\n{\"id\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"OB\": \"\", \"EB\": \"\", \"SR\": \"\"}", "input_content": "<BUG REPORT>\n{'id': '42724', 'title': 'Bug 42724StyledText  selection rendered incorrectly on bidi platforms', 'description': \"Bug 42724StyledTextselection rendered incorrectly on bidi platforms I don't believe we even needto redraw the entire selection background anymore because there is code inStyledTextRenderer.drawLine that creates a style range for the selection. \", 'OB': 'When forcing aredraw of the entire client area the entire bidi segment is drawn with aselection background.The problem is that DisplayRenderer.drawLineSelectionBackgroundincludes code to redraw the entire selection background and that code does nottake bidi segments into account (direction runs).
