{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On linux, when running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000), when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label.", "EB": "The tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) should stay on the same line as the label no matter how small the view is resized. This is a usability problem because users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n3. Observe that the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label."}
