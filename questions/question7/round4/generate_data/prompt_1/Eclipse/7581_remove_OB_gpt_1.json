{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The combo box in column two of the property sheet grows to be the width of the largest item, causing the drop down button to be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column, with the drop down button visible within the visible area.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer. \n2. Edit an object with values that include a string wider than the width of the property sheet column. \n3. Observe that the combo box grows to accommodate the longest item, causing the drop down button to be clipped off the visible area of the property sheet. "}
