Create a working set with one project and select it; the package view is filtered.", "EB": "At the moment of delete, the package view in the background refilters. In my opinion, refiltering should only happen when closing the working set selection dialog, not while manipulating it. Additionally, I think that pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to working sets (including canceling the remove operation).", "SR": "1. Open the application and go to the working set management section. \n2. Create a new working set and select a project to include in it. \n3. Observe that the package view is properly filtered based on the working set's contents. \n4. Click on the delete/remove option for the working set. \n5. Verify that the package view does not immediately refilter in the background while manipulating the working set. \n6. Verify that pressing cancel during the removal operation cancels all changes made to the working set."}
