This behavior is a usability problem as users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": "1. Launch the application on Linux.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n4. Observe that the tool items move below the label."}
