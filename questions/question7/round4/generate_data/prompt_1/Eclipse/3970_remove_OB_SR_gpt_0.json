Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiters of the new file.\n\nExpected behavior: The new file should have Unix line delimiters.\n\nTo fix the issue, a UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, or the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be used by all plugins to ensure consistent line delimiters for new files."}
