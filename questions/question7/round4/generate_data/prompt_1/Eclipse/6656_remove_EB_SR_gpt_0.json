This behavior does not occur on build 20011116 on Nt2000. If the close button and other icons start moving around, it may confuse users.", "EB": "When a view is resized smaller on Linux, the close button should remain at its original position and not move down below the label.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view on Linux.\n2. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n3. Observe the position of the close button and other icons relative to the label.\n4. Verify that the close button remains at its original position and does not move down."}
