{"id": "14197", "title": "Bug 14197 - Removing a working set immediately triggers package view filter", "description": "When removing a working set, the package view is immediately filtered without confirmation, which I believe is incorrect behavior. Furthermore, pressing cancel should cancel the removal of the working set.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a working set with one project and select it.\n2. Remove the working set.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAt the moment of deletion, the package view in the background is filtered without any prompt or confirmation.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nRefiltering should only occur when closing the working set selection dialog, not while manipulating it. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel any changes made to the working sets, including the removal.\n"}
