{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects using a set of row that are name value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor, I create cell editors by calling the method createCellEditor of IPropertyDescriptor. In this case, I use a ComboBoxCellEditor and provide it with a set of strings. The cell editor is displayed in column two of the property sheet with the drop-down button appearing at the right edge of the column. However, if any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The problem is that the drop-down button may now be too far right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped. As a result, users cannot see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "EB": "When a ComboBoxCellEditor is used in the PropertySheetViewer, it should correctly size itself based on the available column width in the property sheet. If any of the strings is wider than the column width, the combo box should resize accordingly to accommodate the largest item, without causing the drop-down button to be clipped outside the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Set up a PropertySheetViewer with a column containing name-value pairs using IPropertyDescriptor.\n2. Assign a ComboBoxCellEditor to the column and provide it with a set of strings, including at least one that is wider than the column width.\n3. Observe that the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be clipped outside the visible area of the property sheet.\n\nExpected behavior: The combo box should correctly size itself without causing the drop-down button to be outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
