{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752: Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to export multiple files with the same name but located in different directories to a zip file, an error occurs. In the 'Export' dialog window, after selecting both projects created earlier, giving the zip file a name (such as test.zip) and initiating the export, an error message box is displayed. The error details indicate that the file with the same name in Project 2 is the cause of the problem.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the export process should complete successfully without any error messages, and the zip file should contain all the selected files, even if they have the same name but different locations in the projects.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Launch WSWB (Web Software Builder) application.\n2. Create two projects.\n3. Under each project, create a new file with the same name, for example, 'foo.txt'.\n4. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export'.\n5. In the export options, choose 'Zip File'.\n6. Select both projects created earlier.\n7. Provide a name for the zip file (e.g., 'test.zip').\n8. Initiate the export process and observe the result."}
