{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.", "EB": "The system should provide a 'Do you want to save your file' dialog box with options for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' (which halts the shutdown).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shutdown/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected result:\n\nA warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their dirty file(s) before the computer is shut down/rebooted.\n\nPlease note that other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) also exhibit this behavior."}
