This behavior should be changed to display an error message.", "OB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open it in another editor does not result in any warning or error message being displayed.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning or error message displayed when trying to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files. \n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will open with the Java file. Close it. \n3. Switch back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file will now be opened in the workbench. \n4. Right-click on the same Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. Note that nothing happens. \n\nExpected behavior: The workbench should display a warning message indicating that opening the file in another editor may result in overwriting changes, and prompt the user to confirm if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, indicating that all files need to be closed first. We believe this is a safety feature implemented in WSAD to prevent external editing while a file is already opened in WSAD."}
