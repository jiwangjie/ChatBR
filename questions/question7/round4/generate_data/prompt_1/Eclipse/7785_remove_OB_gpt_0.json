The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "After performing the SaveAs operation, the file is saved without any file extension and the file icon changes from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "EB": "The SaveAs operation should save the file with the same extension as the original file, unless explicitly changed. The file icon should remain the same as the parent java file icon.", "SR": "1) Open an existing java file.\n2) Modify the java file (for example, move an existing class).\n3) Click on the SaveAs icon, which is located next to the Save icon.\n4) A dialog will appear. Browse for a valid container location.\n5) Type the filename without specifying the file extension (which is not requested).\n6) Click Ok.\n\nExpected result: The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file and the file icon should remain as the parent java file icon.\n\nObserve that the Navigator has added the file at the specified location, but without showing any file extension."}
