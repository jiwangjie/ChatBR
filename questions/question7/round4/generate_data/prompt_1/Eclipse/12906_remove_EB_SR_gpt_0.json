Then, right-click on the file and select 'Open With -> System Editor'. Nothing happens. The desired behavior is for the workbench to display a warning message, indicating that opening the file may overwrite changes and asking for confirmation to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, instructing the user to close all files before proceeding. It is speculated that this behavior is a safety feature implemented to prevent external editing while a file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "When the file is opened in one editor and another attempt is made to open it in a different editor, the workbench should display a warning message mentioning the possibility of overwriting changes and asking for confirmation to continue, or an error message should be shown instructing the user to close all files first before proceeding.", "SR": "1. Open the file in the workbench\n2. Right-click on the file\n3. Select 'Open With -> System Editor'\n4. Observe the absence of any warning or error message"}
