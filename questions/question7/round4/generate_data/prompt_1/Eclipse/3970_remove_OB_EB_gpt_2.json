{"id": "3970", "title": "UI needed to define default line delimiters for new files in Preferences", "description": "Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PC are cheaper than Unix boxes). Currently, there is no option in the Preferences menu to define the default line delimiters for new files. This is causing issues when developing a Unix product/program on both Unix and Windows workstations.", "OB": "Currently, there is no option in the Preferences menu to define the default line delimiters for new files on both Unix and Windows workstations.", "EB": "There should be an option in the Preferences menu to define the default line delimiters for new files on both Unix and Windows workstations.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the Preferences menu.\n2. Look for an option to define default line delimiters for new files.\n3. Observe that there is no such option available.\n4. This demonstrates the need for the addition of this feature."}
