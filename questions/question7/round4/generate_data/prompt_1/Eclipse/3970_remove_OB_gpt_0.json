{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "The Windows work stations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PC are cheaper than Unix boxes).", "OB": "Currently, when a new file is created on Windows, it has Windows line delimiters.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario: Use both a Unix and Windows workstation to develop a Unix product / program."}
