{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse because they are cheaper than Unix boxes. When creating a new file, the line delimiter is currently taken from System.getProperties('line.delimiter'), but this may not always be what the user wants. The end product is a Unix product, so even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters. Therefore, a UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The UI should offer the following values: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins in order to maintain a consistent line delimiter for new files.", "OB": "When creating a new file, the line delimiter is currently taken from System.getProperties('line.delimiter'), but this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "When creating a new file, regardless of the platform, the default line delimiter should be Unix since the end product is a Unix product.

Open the Workbench in Eclipse.\n2. Go to Preferences.\n3. Look for the line delimiter settings under Preferences.\n4. Choose the desired default line delimiter for new files.\n5. Create a new file and verify that the chosen line delimiter is used as the default delimiter."}
