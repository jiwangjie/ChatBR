{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows editing objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include ComboBoxCellEditor. The constructor of ComboBoxCellEditor can be given a list of strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the dropdown button appears at the right edge of the column.\n\nA problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It seems that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The problem is that the dropdown button may now be too far right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, so it is being clipped. This can be a poor user experience as the users cannot see the combo dropdown button without widening the property sheet view until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. When a string in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box expands to match the width of the widest item. As a result, the dropdown button may be pushed outside the visible area of the property sheet and will be clipped, making it difficult for users to access the dropdown button.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should resize itself to accommodate the widest item without pushing the dropdown button outside the visible area of the property sheet. The combo box and the dropdown button should both remain fully visible at all times.", "SR": "1. Open the property sheet viewer.\n2. Create an object with a property that has a long string value.\n3. Edit the property using the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n4. Verify that the combo box expands to accommodate the widest item but does not push the dropdown button outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
