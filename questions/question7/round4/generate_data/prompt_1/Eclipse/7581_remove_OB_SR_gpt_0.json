", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet column. The width of the combo box does not match the width of the column in the property sheet.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box to always have the same width as the property sheet column. It should work similar to the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this issue is caused by us or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet that contains a column with a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n2. Compare the width of the combo box with the width of the column in the property sheet.\n3. Observe that the combo box width does not match the column width."}
