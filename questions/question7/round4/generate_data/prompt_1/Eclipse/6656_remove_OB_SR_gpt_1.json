It is moving down to a new line.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that these two tool items should stay on the same line as the label no matter how small the view gets. The close button should remain located to the far right corner.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Open the application\n2. Resize the view to be smaller\n3. Observe that the close button moves down to a new line instead of staying on the same line as the label"}
