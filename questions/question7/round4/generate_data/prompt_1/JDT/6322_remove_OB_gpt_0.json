JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) etc.", "OB": "The all types dialog displays obfuscated classes with equal prominence as non-obfuscated classes.", "EB": "Obfuscated classes should be displayed with less prominence compared to non-obfuscated classes.", "SR": "To fix this, there are two options: a) Sort lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter, or b) Completely filter out obfuscated classes. I suggest implementing option a)."}
