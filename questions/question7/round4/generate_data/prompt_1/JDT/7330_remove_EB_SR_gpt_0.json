{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed on a personal taste basis, which is not clear to users. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view in order to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu, so users can access it directly without switching to a different view.", "SR": "1. Open the application and go to the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not present in the context menu.\n5. Switch to the Outline view.\n6. Repeat steps 2-4 and verify that the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is now available in the context menu."}
