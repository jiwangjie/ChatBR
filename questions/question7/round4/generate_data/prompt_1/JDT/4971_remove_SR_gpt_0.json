Instead of copying the package with the correct name 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui', it copies it as 'ui'.", "OB": "After performing the 'copy package' operation, the destination package 'xx' contains a package named 'ui'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the destination package 'xx' should contain a package named 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the 'jdt.ui' plugin\n2. Select the package 'xxx'\n3. Choose the 'Copy' option from the context menu\n4. Select 'xx' as the destination package\n5. Verify that the copied package is named 'ui' instead of 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui'."}
