{"id": "8142", "title": "No Scoped Type Hierarchy on Binary Projects", "description": "I encountered a bug where the scoped type hierarchy is not displayed correctly for binary projects. I am using the 'org.apache.ant' library. When I try to view the type hierarchy for this library (org.apache.ant), I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. I'm not sure what this message means and I would like clarification on it.", "OB": "When trying to view the type hierarchy for the 'org.apache.ant' library, the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'' is displayed.", "EB": "I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars when viewing the type hierarchy for the 'org.apache.ant' library.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open a binary project that uses the 'org.apache.ant' library and try to view its type hierarchy. Observe the displayed message and the absence of class hierarchies of the internal jars."}
