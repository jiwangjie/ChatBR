{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project and specifies an existing directory structure as the output folder, the system does not currently confirm if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "The system should display a confirmation dialogue when creating a project and specifying an existing directory structure as the output folder, asking the user if it is okay to delete the existing bin directory and rebuild it.", "SR": "1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Specify an existing directory structure as the output folder.\n3. Click on the 'Create' button.\n4. Observe if a confirmation dialogue appears, asking if it is okay to delete the existing bin directory and rebuild it."}
