Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference, which is not clear to users. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views to access certain actions. The actions should be easily reachable from the editor.", "OB": "I cannot find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' in the global menu or the context menu when selecting text.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in either the global menu or the context menu when selecting text.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the global menu or the context menu."}
