{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, it should be confirmed that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory. This bin directory contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, follow these steps: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory. \n3. Confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. \n4. Observe that some users are unable to do this as the bin directory contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files."}
