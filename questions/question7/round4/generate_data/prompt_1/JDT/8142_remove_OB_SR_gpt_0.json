{"id": "8142", "title": "No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "I don't understand the bug. When I try to view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I get the error message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, can you explain what does this error message mean?", "OB": "When trying to view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project, the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant' occurs.", "EB": "I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars instead of the error message.", "SR": "1. Open a binary project in the application. 2. Go to the scoped type hierarchy view. 3. Select a hierarchy, such as 'org.apache.ant'. 4. Observe the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'."}
