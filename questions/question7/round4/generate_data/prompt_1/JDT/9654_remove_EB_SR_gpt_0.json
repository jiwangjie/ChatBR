{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654 - Modify Parameters: Dialog details", "description": "When modifying parameters in the 'Modify Parameters' dialog, there are a few issues:\n\na. The buttons are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog pops up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\nd. The dialog comes up very large for methods with many parameters.\n\nTo fix these issues:\n\ni. Perform duplicated name validation on the first page of the dialog.\n\nii. Merge the first and second columns in the dialog.", "OB": "a. Buttons are too small.\n\nb.
