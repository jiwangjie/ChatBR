Currently, it requires separate steps to set the classpath and output location.", "EB": "Bug 4974: The setting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Like the validation process, which checks the classpath and output location at once, the user should be able to set both classpath and output location together in a single step.", "SR": "1. Open the program settings menu.\n2. Look for the option to set the classpath and output location.\n3. Observe that there are separate options to set the classpath and output location.\n4. Click on the option to set the classpath.\n5. Observe that only the classpath is being set and not the output location.\n6. Now, click on the option to set the output location.\n7. Observe that only the output location is being set and not the classpath.\n8. Expected behavior: The user should be able to set both the classpath and output location together in a single step."}
