{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When you press Ok after setting the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, you get the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. By setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location.\n4. Press Ok."}
