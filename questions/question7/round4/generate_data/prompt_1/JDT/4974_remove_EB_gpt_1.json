{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the user presses Ok after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and output location, an error message appears: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This is because setting the output location and classpath are currently two separate operations, and setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
