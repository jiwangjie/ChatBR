It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left until the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). Regardless, if there is a stray space, it is confusing as to why the text won't shift.", "EB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft should move the text.
