{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal preferences, which is not clear to users. All actions should be reachable from the editor, either through the context menu or the Edit menu.", "OB": "I couldn't find the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the context menu on text selection.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the context menu on text selection and also in the Edit menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available.\n4. If the action is not available, go to the Edit menu and check if the action is available there."}
