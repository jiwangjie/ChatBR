It is confusing because it is not clear why the text won't shift. There may also be a stray space that should be removed. It is unclear how the behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab).", "EB": "After replacing the tab character with spaces in the first line, executing ShiftLeft should move the second line to be indented the same visually as the first line.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   - first line: <space><tab>some text\n   - second line: <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight both lines.\n4. Execute ShiftLeft.\n\nExpected result: The second line should be shifted left to be indented the same visually as the first line."}
