{"id": "5340", "title": "Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. However, the exception list still comes up, disregarding the cancellation request. This behavior is not expected.", "EB": "When the cancellation request is made in the progress dialog, the process of adding the exception breakpoint should be either cancelled or the cancel button should be disabled. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be passed as false.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the J! button to add an exception. 3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
