The behavior is confusing if there is a stray space.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when executing ShiftLeft, the text should be shifted left. In the case of intermixed tabs and spaces, the first line should have the tab character replaced with spaces to maintain consistent indentation. The second line should also be shifted left, at least until the first non-space character (i.e., eliminate the tab).", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open a file or text editor with intermixed tabs and spaces.\n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same way.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n4. Observe that the text does not shift as expected."}
