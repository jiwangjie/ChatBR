{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "The current process of setting the classpath and output location in the project properties is not optimal. It would be more convenient if these two actions could be performed as a single operation. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the error message displayed when trying to set a nested source folder.", "OB": "The current process of setting the classpath and output location in the project properties requires separate operations.", "EB": "The classpath and output location setting should be combined into a single operation for better usability. Additionally, the error message displayed when attempting to set a nested source folder should be improved to provide a clearer explanation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project as both the source folder and output location."}
