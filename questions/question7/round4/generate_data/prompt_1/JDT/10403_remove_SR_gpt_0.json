{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When creating a new project, there should be a confirmation step to ensure that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Select 'Create New Project' from the menu.\n3. Choose an existing directory structure with a bin folder.\n4. In the output folder selection, navigate to the bin directory.\n5. Click on 'Create Project'.\n6. Confirm that a prompt appears asking if you want to allow the deletion and rebuild of the bin directory.\n7. Proceed with the project creation process and observe that the bin directory is scrubbed and rebuilt."}
