{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, code assist eats too much code. When adding a parameter to the `baz` call in `bar`, the code should be `baz(x.x.foo())` instead of `baz(x.foo())`. The code should be changed to:\n\n```java\npublic class X {\n void bar(X x) {\n  baz(x.x.foo());\n }\n\n int foo() {\n  return 5;\n }\n\n void baz(int i, int j) {}\n}\n```\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Place the cursor after the first \"x.\" in the `baz` call in `bar`.\n2. Press `Ctrl+Space` to bring up code assist.\n3. Type \"f\" to filter the list.\n4. Select \"foo()\" from the list.\n", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\n```java\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n```\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\n```java\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n```", "EB": "The code should be changed to:\n\n```java\nbaz(x.x.foo())\n```", "SR": "Change the `baz` call to `baz(x.x.foo())`"}
