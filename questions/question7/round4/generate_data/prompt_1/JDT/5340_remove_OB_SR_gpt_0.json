{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to add an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog does not respond to cancellation.", "EB": "The progress dialog immediately closes and the exception breakpoint is added regardless of the cancellation request.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Open the application in debug mode\n2. Open the breakpoint view\n3. Click on \"Add Exception Breakpoint\"\n4. In the progress dialog, click on the \"Cancel\" button\n\nExpected behavior: The progress dialog should close and the exception breakpoint should not be added.\n\nPotential solution: Modify the code that handles the progress dialog to either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button by passing \"false\" for the \"cancellable\" parameter when calling \"ProgressMonitorDialog.run\"."}
