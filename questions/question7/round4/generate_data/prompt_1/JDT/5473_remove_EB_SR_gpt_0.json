Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character is replaced with spaces in the first line so that both lines are visually indented the same, then executing ShiftLeft does not behave as expected. Instead, the text moves inconsistently. It is unclear how this behavior is specified. However, in the given scenario, it is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). Additionally, it is confusing when there is a stray space because it becomes unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character with spaces in the first line, executing ShiftLeft should consistently shift the text as follows: - The second line should be shifted left. - The first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open the text editor. 2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces until the lines are visually indented the same. 3. Perform the ShiftLeft operation. Observe the behavior and note any inconsistencies or unexpected movements of the text."}
