{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters - Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters - The dialog details have the following issues:\ni. Duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second columns could be merged.\n\nThe bug report lacks clarity in the OB (Observed Behavior) section. However, based on the description, we can infer the following:\n\nOB: \nThe marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\n\nThe bug report also lacks clarity in the SR (Steps to Reproduce) section. However, based on the description, we can infer the following: \n\nSR: \n1. Change a param name to something very long.\n\nThe bug report has provided clear EB (Expected Behavior) statements, which are as follows:\n\nEB: \n1. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n2. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied on more than one item.\n3. The signature preview must be a label that wraps.\n4. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover."}
