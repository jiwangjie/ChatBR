I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal preference, which should be changed.

It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not present in the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be included in the context menu.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is included in the menu.\n5.
