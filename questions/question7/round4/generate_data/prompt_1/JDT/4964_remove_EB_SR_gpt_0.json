{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is open because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidget, dispose(), and voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(', the automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should recognize that after typing 'button.dispose', adding a '(' indicates that I am about to type 'button.dispose()', and should suggest that option instead of 'button.DISPOSED' or any other options. It should also be case sensitive when automatically inserting code suggestions.", "SR": "1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code.\n2. Type 'button.dispose'.\n3. Do not look at the code assist list.\n4. After typing 'button.dispose', type '('.\n5. Observe that the code assist inserts a suggestion based on the previous selection instead of the expected 'dispose()' method.\n6. Verify that the code assist does not provide case-sensitive suggestions."}
