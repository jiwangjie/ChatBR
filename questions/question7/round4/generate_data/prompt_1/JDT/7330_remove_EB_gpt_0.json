{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis. This should be changed as it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, including the ability to add a Javadoc comment. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform text selection and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available in the context menu. If it is not, verify if it can be accessed via the Edit menu."}
