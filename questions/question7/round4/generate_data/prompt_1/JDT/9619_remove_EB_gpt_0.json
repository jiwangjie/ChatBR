No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName.\n\nc. Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes)\nd. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\n\ne. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\nf. Destination type can be source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n\nBrowse offers me a type from a CU in a different project.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nBrowse should only offer types from the source folders of the current project.", "OB": "Browse offers me a type from a CU in a different project.", "EB": "Browse should only offer types from the source folders of the current project.", "SR": "1.
