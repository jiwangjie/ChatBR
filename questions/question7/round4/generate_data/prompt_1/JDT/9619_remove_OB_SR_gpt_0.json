Selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.h. ", "OB": "The current behavior of the dialog is unclear. It is missing mnemonic keys, there is no validation on the type field, and the label does not clearly indicate that a destination type should be selected. It is also unclear how the selection dialog is initialized.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the dialog should have mnemonic keys, there should be validation on the type field, the label should clearly say 'Select destination type:', and the selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": "1. Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Check if there are mnemonic keys set for the dialog elements.\n3. Try entering an invalid type in the type field and check if an appropriate validation message is displayed.\n4. Verify that the label in the selection dialog says 'Select destination type:'.\n5. Check if the selection dialog is initialized with the type currently entered."}
