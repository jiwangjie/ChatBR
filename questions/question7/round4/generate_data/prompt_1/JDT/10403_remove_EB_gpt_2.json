{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project, there is no confirmation or check to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation or check to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n3. Attempt to delete the output directory and rebuild it.\n4. Observe that there is no confirmation or check to ensure the successful deletion and rebuilding of the output directory."}
