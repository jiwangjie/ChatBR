{"id": "8142", "title": "No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "I am observing an issue with the scoped type hierarchy on binary projects. When I try to view the type hierarchy for a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I see the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. I would like to understand the meaning of this message as well.", "OB": "When trying to view the type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I am seeing the message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "When trying to view the type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant) and try to view its type hierarchy. The message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant' should be displayed instead of the class hierarchies of the internal jars."}
