{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in build 204, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose()voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "When writing SWT code and using automatic code assist, it should recognize that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' better than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, it should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "1. Open a new SWT code file in build 204.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Note that the code assist list appears, but do not look at it.\n4. Type '('.\n5. Note that the code assist inserts the selected suggestion instead of the correct method call.\n6. Delete the inserted suggestion and manually type '();' to complete the correct method call."}
