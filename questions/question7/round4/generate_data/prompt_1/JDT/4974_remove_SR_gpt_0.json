{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue is that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. By setting the output location first, it creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Like the validation process (checking classpath and output location simultaneously), the setting of classpath / output location should be combined into one operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "1. Open the application\n2. Go to the settings\n3. Set the output location\n4.
