{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, code assist eats too much code. The code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me\n\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Create a class X with the following code:\n\n```java\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n\n    void baz(int i, int j) {}\n}\n```\n\n2. Call the `bar` method passing an instance of X.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nThe code assist should generate `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())` instead of `baz(x.foo())`.", "OB": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist generates `baz(x.foo())` instead of `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())`.", "EB": "The code assist should generate `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())` instead of `baz(x.foo())`.", "SR": "1.
