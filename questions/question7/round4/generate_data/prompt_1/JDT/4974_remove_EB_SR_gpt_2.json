{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok after setting the output location, the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src' is displayed. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are performed as two separate operations, creating an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the project settings dialog \n2. Navigate to the 'Output Location' tab \n3. Set the output location to a directory that is nested within the source folder \n4. Click on 'Ok' and observe the error message."}
