{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "The New Package Wizard in the IDE shows a confusing message when the package name field is empty. The message states 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message should not be displayed when the package name field is empty. Additionally, the message does not clearly indicate whether it is an error or a warning. If it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. It would also be helpful to have an option to create a default package.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' appears at the top, even when the package name field is empty.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should not appear at the top when the package name field is empty.
