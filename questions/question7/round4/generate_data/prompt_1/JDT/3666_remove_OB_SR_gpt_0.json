To reproduce the issue, follow the steps below:\n\nSteps:\n1. Open a file in the UI that triggers the code assist feature.\n2. Edit the code in a way that the code assist feature is triggered.\n3. Notice that the code assist removes more code than necessary when making a specific function call.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB):\nThe code should preserve the existing code and only insert the necessary parameter for the function call.\n\nObserved Behavior (OB):\nThe code assist feature removes more code than necessary when adding a parameter to a function call. The code is changed to:\n\n```\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n```\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\n```\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n```\n\nThis behavior causes incorrect program behavior.\n", "OB": "The code assist feature removes more code than necessary when adding a parameter to a function call.
