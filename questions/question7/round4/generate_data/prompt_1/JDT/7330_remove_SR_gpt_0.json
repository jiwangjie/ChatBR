Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis and it is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view in order to access certain actions. The actions should be accessible from the editor.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a block of text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Look for the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the context menu."}
