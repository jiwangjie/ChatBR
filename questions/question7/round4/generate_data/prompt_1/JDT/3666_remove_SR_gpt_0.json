{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: Code Completion Hungry code assist (1GDRYW5)", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the user interface consumes too much code. When adding a parameter to the `baz` call in the `bar` method, the code needs to be modified. The steps to reproduce the issue are as follows: \n\n1. Modify the code to `baz(x.foo().foo())`.\n\nExpected Behavior: The code should be modified to `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())`.\n\nActual Behavior: The code is changed to `baz(x.foo().foo())`.", "OB": "Under certain circumstances, code assist eats too much code. Consider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the `baz` call in `bar` to make the program correct.\n\nSteps:\n1. UI can decide whether it wants to use the code assist end position (until the end of the current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, so as to control the amount of source to replace. Removing code assist option.", "EB": "The code is changed to `baz(x.foo().foo())`. I would rather it gave me `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())`.\n\nThe text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure.\n\nOption was added.\n\nRemoving option. The choice between one or the other should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location). Moving to `ITPJUI`.", "SR": "1. Open the enclosed class.\n2. Modify the `baz` call in the `bar` method by adding a parameter.\n3. Observe that the code assist feature consumes too much code by changing the code to `baz(x.foo().foo())` instead of `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())`."}
