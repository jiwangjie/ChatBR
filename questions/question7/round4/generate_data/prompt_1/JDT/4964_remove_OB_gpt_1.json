{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the code assist feature while typing SWT code, the suggested completion option 'DISPOSED' is automatically inserted instead of the expected completion option 'dispose()' after typing 'button.'.", "EB": "The code assist feature should intelligently detect that the user has typed a '(' after 'button.' and prioritize the completion option 'dispose()' over 'DISPOSED' which is a poor match. Additionally, it should consider the case sensitivity when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "1. Open Build 204\n2. Start writing SWT code\n3. Type 'button.dispose'\n4. Observe that the code assist list pops up\n5. Without looking at the code assist list, continue typing"}
