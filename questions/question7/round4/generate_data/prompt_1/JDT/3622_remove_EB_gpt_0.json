{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "The New Package Wizard in the Java IDE displays a confusing message when the package name field is empty. The user wants clarification on the meaning of this message and whether it should be considered an error. They also suggest that if it is an error, it should be displayed in red with an error icon. The user notes that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Additionally, the user mentions an issue with creating a default package and asks for guidance on how to create it since it always exists.", "OB": "When the user invokes the 'New Java Package' function, a message appears at the top of the wizard which says 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even though the package name field is empty.", "EB": "When the package name field is empty, the New Package Wizard should not display any message or warning at the top. If there is an error, it should be clearly indicated in red with an appropriate icon. The 'Finish' button should be disabled until a valid package name is entered. Regarding the default package issue, the user is seeking guidance on how to create it since it always exists.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Create a new Java Project.\n2. Select the project.\n3. Open the New Package Wizard."}
