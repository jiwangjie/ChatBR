{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. The current code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message when the page is loaded since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema on the system, resulting in a large number of tables being displayed. The schema filter implemented in the current code is not sufficient to prevent the warning message from appearing on page load.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load the tables and columns on demand, instead of querying the entire schema and displaying all the tables at once. The schema filter should effectively filter the tables based on the selected schema, eliminating the need for the warning message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the slow loading of the entire schema, followed by the warning message stating that only 500 items can be viewed. Bug 101372 requests the ability to filter the tables based on schema."}
