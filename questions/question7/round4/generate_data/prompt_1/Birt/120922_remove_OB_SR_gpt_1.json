{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs to be improved", "description": "When working in the XML Report Designer editor, the user encounters a 'Dirty Page' behavior that needs improvement. After making changes in the editor, a dialog box appears with the message 'Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved.' (including the quotes). The user then needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog box also gives the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' with the following actions: \n\n- 'Yes' would save the changes\n- 'No' would discard the changes\n- 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page\n\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the dialog box is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "The current behavior of the XML Report Designer editor is as described above.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to improve the behavior of the XML Report Designer editor. The dialog box should use a more appropriate title and should not include the quotes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Make changes to the report.\n3. Attempt to navigate to other pages within the editor.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe dialog box should have a clear and informative title without quotes.\n\nPlease note that the exact steps to reproduce the issue may vary depending on the specific implementation of the XML Report Designer editor."}
