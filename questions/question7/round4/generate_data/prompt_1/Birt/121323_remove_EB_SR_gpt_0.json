However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior leads to the loss of filter information.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information stored in the filterInfo HashMap, so that it is not lost after leaving the dialog.", "SR": "1.
