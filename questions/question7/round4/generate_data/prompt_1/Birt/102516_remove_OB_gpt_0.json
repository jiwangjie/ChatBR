{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the schema is queried and the entire list of tables and columns are loaded, causing a delay. As a result, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This would improve the user experience and avoid the delay caused by querying the entire schema.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Observe the delay while the entire schema is queried and the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message is displayed.\n\nNote: Bug 101372 requests the ability to filter based on schema, which can be considered as an additional feature request."}
