The displayed results are the same regardless of the content type set.", "EB": "The expected behavior is as follows: \n- When the Content Type is set to Plain, the literal content should be displayed, including any tags.\n- When the Content Type is set to Auto, the content should appear properly without any HTML or RTF tags.\n- When the Content Type is set to HTML, the first two sections of the content should appear properly without any HTML tags, and the third section should appear literally with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the attached report.\n2. Set the Content Type property of the dynamic text element to Auto.\n3. Verify that the displayed results do not change.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the Plain and HTML options of the Content Type property."}
