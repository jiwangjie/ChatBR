{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "The bug report states that the library include in a report design currently stores the absolute path, but it should store the relative path instead.", "OB": "Currently, the report design is storing the absolute path of the library include. For example, <property name=\"fileName\">/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The report design should store the relative path of the library include. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test and the library is located in $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved as ../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design.\n3. Include a library from a different directory.\n4. Check the saved path of the library include to ensure it is storing the relative path correctly."}
