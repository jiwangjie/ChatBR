The problem is that the user is not provided with clear instructions on how to save or discard their changes. The error message, titled 'Error', is displayed with quotation marks. The user is then presented with the options to save the changes by selecting 'Yes', discard the changes by selecting 'No', or cancel the action by selecting 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Yes' saves the changes, selecting 'No' discards the changes, and selecting 'Cancel' does nothing and remains on the Source page.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed stating the need to save the changes.
