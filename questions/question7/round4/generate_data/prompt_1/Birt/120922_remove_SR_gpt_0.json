Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled \"Error\" (including the quotes).\n\nIf you edit the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very informative. The error message is \"Source page is dirty.\"", "OB": "The user edits the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor and attempts to switch back to the Layout view. Instead of being able to switch views, an error message pops up, indicating that the changes need to be saved. The error message is not clear and does not provide enough information on how to proceed.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be for the user to be presented with a dialog that states the XML Report Design has been changed and offers options to save or discard the changes. The title of the dialog should not include quotes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Switch to the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor.\n3.
