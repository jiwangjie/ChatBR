{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When I open the report design, I can see that the <property name=\"fileName\"/> attribute in the XML code contains an absolute path: 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'. This absolute path should be replaced with a relative path to improve portability and flexibility.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design file.\n2. Look for the <property name=\"fileName\"/> attribute in the XML code.\n3. Verify that the value is an absolute path instead of a relative path.\n4. Modify the report design to store the relative path instead of the absolute path.\n5. Save the changes and reopen the report design to confirm that the relative path is now stored correctly."}
