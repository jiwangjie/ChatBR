{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is shown. This bug aims to improve the performance by implementing on-demand loading of tables and columns. Bug 101372 requests the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is shown.", "EB": "The data set editor should only load tables and columns on demand, resulting in faster loading times. The 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message should not be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Observe the loading time and the message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. Open the data set editor.\n2. The loading time should be significantly faster.\n3. The message should not appear."}
