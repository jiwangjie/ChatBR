However, upon leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information, including the XPath expression with the selection part, when leaving the dialog and storing the RelationInformation to .rptdesign.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check the .rptdesign file to verify that the RelationInformation is persisted, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
