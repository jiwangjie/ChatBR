{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "The bug report is about the issue of the report design storing absolute paths instead of relative paths when including a library. It is desired to save the relative path instead of the absolute path.", "OB": "Currently, the report design stores the absolute path. For example, in the <property> tag, the fileName attribute contains the absolute path: 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'. The <property> tag also contains the namespace property: 'lib1'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate the relative path and save it. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, the relative path should be '../../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Check the path of the included library to verify if it is stored as a relative path."}
