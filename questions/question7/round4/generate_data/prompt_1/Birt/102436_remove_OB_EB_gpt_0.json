{"id": "102436", "title": "Bug 102436 - Date/time value not stored correctly in report design", "description": "An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected when attempting to store it in the report design.", "OB": "When creating a report in the BIRT report designer and setting a default value for a 'DateTime' type report parameter, if an invalid date string (such as '55/66/9999') is entered in the 'defaultvalue' field, the system does not reject it.", "EB": "The system should reject the invalid date string and display an error message informing the user that the entered value is not a valid date/time format.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the BIRT report designer. \n2. Create a new report. \n3. Add a 'DateTime' type report parameter. \n4. In the 'defaultvalue' field, enter an invalid date string, such as '55/66/9999'. \n5. Save the report design. \n6. Verify that the system does not reject the invalid date string and instead allows it to be stored without any error message."}
