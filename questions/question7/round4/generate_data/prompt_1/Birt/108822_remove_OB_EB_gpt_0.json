{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient logic needed to process disk sorting when there is a boundary value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk, if the program is set to process only a portion of the data (less than 40000 rows in this case), the following steps are observed:\n1. The file is saved as a temporary file.\n2. The file is loaded into memory.\n3. The sorting operation is performed on the data.\n4. The sorted data is saved back to the temporary file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the sorting process should be more efficient and optimized, specifically when there is a boundary value for the row count. The disk sorting logic should be improved to handle these cases more effectively.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Prepare a dataset with 40000 rows of data.\n2. Configure the program to process less than 40000 rows of data.\n3. Trigger the sorting operation on the dataset.\n4. Observe the steps taken during the sorting process and confirm if the expected optimization is not achieved."}
