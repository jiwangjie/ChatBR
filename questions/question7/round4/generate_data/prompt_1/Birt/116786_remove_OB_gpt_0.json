{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include does not store relative path", "description": "The issue is related to the way the BIRT designer handles library inclusion in a report design. Currently, when a library is included, the BIRT designer does not generate and save the relative path, causing potential problems when moving or sharing the report design. The expected behavior is that the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library.", "OB": "The BIRT designer does not generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design.", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test and the library is located in $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design located in $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Close and reopen the report design. The library inclusion should still reference the relative path."}
