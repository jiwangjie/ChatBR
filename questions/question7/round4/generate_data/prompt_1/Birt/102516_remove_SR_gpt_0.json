Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 contains a schema filter, but a warning message still appears on load because the tree is being populated on load.\n\nIt is requested to defer the loading of the tree until the user either expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system.
