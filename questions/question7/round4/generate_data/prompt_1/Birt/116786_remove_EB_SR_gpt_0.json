{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the report design stores the absolute path for library includes. Instead, it should save the relative path.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the report design file.\n2. Navigate to the section where library includes are defined.\n3. Observe that the property 'fileName' contains an absolute path, e.g., E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Modify the property 'fileName' to use a relative path.\n5. Save the report design file and close it.\n6. Reopen the report design file and verify that the library include now uses the saved relative path."}
