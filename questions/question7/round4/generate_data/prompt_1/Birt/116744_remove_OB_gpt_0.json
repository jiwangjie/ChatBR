{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "The dynamic text element's Content Type property does not have any effect on the displayed results.", "OB": "The report displays the same results regardless of the Content Type property set for the dynamic text element.", "EB": "When the Content Type property is set to 'Plain', I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed. When set to 'Auto', I expect the content without any HTML or RTF tags. And when set to 'HTML', I expect the HTML tags to be removed for content 1 and 2, and content 3 to be displayed with the RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Prepare a database field with three types of content:\n   a. HTML text within <html>...</html> tags.\n   b. HTML fragments not within <html> tags.\n   c. Text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field."}
