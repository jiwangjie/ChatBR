The problem is that the user is then left to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog box titled 'Error' appears with the options 'Yes', 'No' and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Yes' saves the changes, 'No' discards the changes, and 'Cancel' does nothing and remains on the Source page. The error message displayed is 'Source page is dirty.'", "OB": "When editing XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then trying to switch back to the Layout view, the user receives an error message indicating that they need to save their changes.", "EB": "When editing XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then trying to switch back to the Layout view, the user should be presented with a clear dialogue box that provides options to save or discard changes.
