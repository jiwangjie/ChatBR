{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Currently, in the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the schema filter is present, but there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query lists every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed.

This means that the tree control should initially display only the top-level schemas (catalogs), allowing the user to expand a schema to load its tables and columns when needed.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers.\n2. Observe that the tree control initially displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed.\n3. Notice the warning message on load, indicating that the tree is being populated on load.\n4. Verify that the schema filter is present, but it does not prevent the loading of all tables and columns on load.\n5. The expected behavior is that the tree control should only load tables and columns on demand, meaning it should initially display only the top-level schemas (catalogs), allowing the user to expand a schema to load its tables and columns when needed."}
