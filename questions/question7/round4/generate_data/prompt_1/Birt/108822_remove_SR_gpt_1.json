This bug report aims to improve the disk sorting logic in such scenarios.", "OB": "When sorting the data on disk, if there are 40000 rows of data and the program is set to process only a subset of the data less than 40000 rows, the current logic performs the following operations:\n1.

However, a more efficient logic is expected to handle the disk sorting. For example, the data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": ""}
