{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is a border value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when sorting data on disk and there is a border value for row value, the logic used is not optimal. The program follows these steps: 1. Saves the file as a temp file. 2. Loads the file into memory. 3. Sorts the data. 4. Saves the sorted data back to the temp file.", "EB": "A more efficient logic should be implemented to process disk sorting when there is a border value for row value. The program should sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps: 1. Prepare a dataset with 40,000 rows. 2. Set the program to process data less than 40,000 rows. 3. Perform the sort on disk operation."}
