{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the report design stores the absolute path of the library include. It should instead save the relative path.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design file.\n2. Locate the library include section.\n3. Ensure that the 'fileName' property contains an absolute path, such as 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.\n4. Modify the 'fileName' property to use a relative path instead.\n5. Save the changes to the report design file."}
