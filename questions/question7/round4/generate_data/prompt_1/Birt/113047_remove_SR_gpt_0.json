This issue occurs when creating a new data set without an SQL statement, and the new data source does not contain any database, table, or column information. After changing the data source, closing the data set editor and reopening it still does not display the child nodes.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when changing the data source, the child nodes of the new data source should be listed.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Create a new data set without specifying an SQL statement. \n2. Select a data source that has no database, table, or column information. \n3. Change the data source for the data set. \n4. Close the data set editor. \n5. Reopen the data set editor and verify that no child nodes are listed for the new data source."}
