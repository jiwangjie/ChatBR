{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When starting Tomcat, the connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method as expected, but only later in the start() method. This issue was observed and tested in trunk at revision 957942, so it likely affects version 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase that allows connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This phase is implemented using separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstart.start() methods [1]. However, this issue seems to break the fix for bug 48625. To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g., 80). Although I do not use jsvc, I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that was applied in revision 957960. When starting the second instance, it fails but not in the expected way. 3. The actual behavior is that the exception does not occur because the connector does not attempt to bind to the port. It only binds when the start() method is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connectors should successfully bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() method, before the start() method is called. This behavior should be consistent with the separate prestartup phase in TC6. The second instance should fail in the expected manner. The exception should be triggered when attempting to bind to the port.", "SR": ""}
