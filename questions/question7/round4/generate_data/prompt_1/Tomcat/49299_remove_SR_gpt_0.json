{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual result is that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nbut the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid':\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "The expected result is that the Reload link should use the custom cookie name instead of 'jsessionid'. The expected Reload link should be:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Enable URL rewriting in the web application.\n2. Set a custom name for the session tracking cookie.\n3. Access a page in the web application.\n4. Check the cookie and observe that it has the custom name.\n5. Click on the Reload link on the page.\n6. Note that the Reload link uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name."}
