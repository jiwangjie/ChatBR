This behavior is incorrect and does not match the expected behavior of returning an HTTP error 404.", "EB": "If no webapps are deployed and a URL is accessed, the server should return an HTTP error 404 to indicate that the requested resource is not found.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Download the Tomcat 7 installation from http://mirror.veriportal.com/apache/tomcat/tomcat7/v7.0.0beta/bin/apachetomcat7.0.0.zip 2. Start a Tomcat 7 instance with no webapps deployed. 3. Access any URL with the server's address. Expected result: The server should return an HTTP error 404. Actual result: The server returns an HTTP code 200 OK with no content."}
