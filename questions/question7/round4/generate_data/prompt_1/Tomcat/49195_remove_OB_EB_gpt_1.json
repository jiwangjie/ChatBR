This can be used to differentiate between the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. It is possible that jsvc may show the same behavior, but it has not been tested.", "OB": "When the Tomcat service is started and stopped on Windows, an error message is printed even though the shutdown port is set to 1.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when the Tomcat service is started and stopped on Windows, even when the shutdown port is set to 1.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example,\nby calling Catalina.stop()."}
