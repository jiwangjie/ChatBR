{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, it is observed that Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). This issue also affects version 7.0.0. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, which allows Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This separation is achieved by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstart.start() methods [1]. However, it seems that this changeset breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce this issue: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g. port 80). The issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 applied in r957960. The second instance fails, but not in the expected way. 3. Instead of throwing an exception, the connector does not try to bind to the port. It binds when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true. Then, start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time.", "SR": ""}
