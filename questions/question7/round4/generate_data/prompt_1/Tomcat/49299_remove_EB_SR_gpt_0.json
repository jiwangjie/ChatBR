{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Incorrect behavior of custom session tracking cookie name in Servlet 3.0", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual behavior is different. The page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name. The attached file 'cookiename.war' demonstrates this issue.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nBut the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid':\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "When a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled).

Access the page using the URL http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp.\n3. Check the received cookie header to see the name of the session tracking cookie.\n4. Click on the Reload link on the page and observe the URL to see if the session id is encoded using the custom cookie name or 'jsessionid'."}
