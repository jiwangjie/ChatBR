{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well.In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started.IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.To reproduce:1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When starting Tomcat, the Connectors do not bind to their ports immediately in the Catalina.load() method, but only later in the start() method.", "EB": "I would expect that in the StandardServiceinitInternal() method, the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there, and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start Tomcat and observe that the first instance starts successfully."}
