This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc -d subpackage Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory named \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory instead of the current directory.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nI expect the same behavior as javac, which creates the output directory in the current directory.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nCurrently, ajc creates the output directory within the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nIt will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "OB": "ajc currently creates the output directory within the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "I expect the same behavior as javac, which creates the output directory in the current directory.", "SR": "Run the ajc command with the -d option while correctly compiling classes from a subpackage."}
