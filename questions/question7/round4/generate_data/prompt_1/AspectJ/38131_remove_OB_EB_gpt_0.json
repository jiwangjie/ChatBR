This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d subpackage\\ Test.java\n\nExpected Behavior:\nWhen compiling the class using ajc, the compiled .class file should be placed in the correct subpackage directory.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nCurrently, when compiling the class using ajc, a new directory with the same name as the subpackage is created under the existing subpackage directory, causing duplication of the directory structure.\n\nPlease note that this issue does not occur when using javac. It would be helpful to have the -d option available for ajc to correctly compile classes from a subpackage.", "OB": "Currently, when compiling the class using ajc, a new directory with the same name as the subpackage is created under the existing subpackage directory, causing duplication of the directory structure.", "EB": "When compiling the class using ajc, the compiled .class file should be placed in the correct subpackage directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
