The source path is listed incorrectly when targeting .class files from injars. Instead of using the correct form \"app/Main\", it is displayed as \"app.Main.class\". This can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. It's important to note that these tests have limitations and may give false positives due to the absence of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. If the filename doesn't make sense to AJDT, it may be omitted.", "OB": "When using declare warning on binary files, the source path is displayed as \"app.Main.class\" instead of the correct form \"app/Main\".", "EB": "When using declare warning on binary files, the source path should be displayed as \"app/Main\".", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, run the code in the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory and observe that the source path in the declare warning messages is displayed incorrectly as \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\"."}
