{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "When using 1.1rc1, ajc (AspectJ compiler) does not behave correctly when compiling classes from a subpackage. This is a regression since rc1 and differs from the behavior of javac. I suspect that this issue may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage. For example:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nAfter executing the command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. The compiled Test.class file is placed in the subpackage\\subpackage directory. As a result, running the java command leads to the following exception:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can use the following command instead:\najc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\nThis command correctly puts the compiled class in the expected directory structure.", "OB": "After compiling the Test class using the ajc command, the compiled Test.class file is put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory.\n\nThis means that running the java command results in the following exception:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nRunning either of the following commands fixes the problem:\najc -d . subpackage\\Test.java", "EB": "The compiled Test.class file should be placed directly in the subpackage directory, not the subpackage\\subpackage directory.\n\nRunning the java command should not result in any exceptions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile the class using the command 'ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java'.\n3. Execute the java command to verify that no exceptions are thrown."}
