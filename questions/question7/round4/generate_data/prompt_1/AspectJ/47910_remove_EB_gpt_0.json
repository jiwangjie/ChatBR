{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The ajc command used with the 'outjar' option does not include the MANIFEST.MF file in the generated jar file.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' option, followed by 'outjar' and a desired output file name with the .jar extension, an output file is created. However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it does not include the MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc mentions the 'outjar' option as creating a zip file, but it is unclear why a parameter called 'outjar' would create a zip file instead of a proper jar file.", "EB": "When I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' option, followed by 'outjar' and a desired output file name with the .jar extension, an output file should be created that is a valid jar file. The generated jar file should include the required MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the ajc command with the 'sourceroots' option, specifying the source directory.\n2. Include the 'outjar' option, followed by the desired output file name with the .jar extension.\n3. Check the generated jar file to verify that it includes the MANIFEST.MF file."}
