{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The ajc command is not creating a valid jar file when the outjar parameter is used. The resulting jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I execute the ajc command with the following arguments: sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, it creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not include a MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation suggests that the outjar parameter should put the output classes in a zip file, but calling it outjar implies that it should create a jar file instead.", "EB": "The ajc command should generate a valid jar file when the outjar parameter is used. The generated jar file should include a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the ajc command with the following arguments: sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar and verify that the generated jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
