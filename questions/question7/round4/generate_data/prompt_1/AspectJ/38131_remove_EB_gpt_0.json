{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option. I am using version 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage:\n   - Package: subpackage\n   - Class: Test\n   - Code:\n     ```\n     package subpackage;\n\n     public class Test {\n         public static void main(String[] args) {\n             System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   - Command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior: The test.class file is then put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory. This means running the java command results in the exception:\n   - Exception: Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nExpected Behavior: Running either of the following commands fixes the problem:\n   - ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n   - javac subpackage\\Test.java\n", "OB": "The test.class file is then put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory.
