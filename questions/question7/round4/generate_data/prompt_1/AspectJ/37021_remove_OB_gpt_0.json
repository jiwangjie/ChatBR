See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run and reproduce the problem. Currently, the tests have limitations as they may produce false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. (I observed this issue in AJDT, where AJDT might omit the filename if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.)", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the tests in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. and check the source path displayed in the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars. The source path should be in the form 'app/Main'. "}
