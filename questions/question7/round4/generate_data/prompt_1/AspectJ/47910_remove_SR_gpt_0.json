{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using the ajc command with the parameters 'sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar', an output file is created with a .jar extension. However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The command 'outjar <file' suggests that the output should be a zip file, but it is expected to be a valid jar file when the 'outjar' parameter is used.", "OB": "When I use the 'ajc' command with the parameters 'sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar', an output file is created with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file present.", "EB": "If the 'outjar' parameter is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "1. Provide a directory path for 'sourceroots' parameter.\n2. Use 'outjar' parameter followed by the desired output jar file name.\n3. Verify that the resulting file contains a valid MANIFEST.MF file."}
