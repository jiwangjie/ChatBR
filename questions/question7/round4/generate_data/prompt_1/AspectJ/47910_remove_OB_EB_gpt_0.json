The command successfully creates an output file with a .jar extension.", "EB": "The resulting .jar file is not a valid .jar file because it does not contain the required MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run the ajc command with the 'sourceroots' parameter set to '<mydir>'\n2. Specify the 'outjar' parameter as '<my.jar>'\n3. Verify that the output file is created with a .jar extension\n4. Check the contents of the resulting .jar file and confirm that it does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file. "}
