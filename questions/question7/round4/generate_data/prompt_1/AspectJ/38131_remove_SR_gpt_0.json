This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n```\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n       System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n   }\n}\n```\n2. Compile using the following command:\n```\najc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n```\n3. Observe that a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nObserved Behavior (OB):\nThe test.class file is put in the \"subpackage\\subpackage\" directory.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB):\nThe test.class file should be put in the \"subpackage\" directory, matching the behavior of javac.\n\nSteps to Reproduce (SR):\nRunning the following command fixes the problem:\n```\najc -d .\n```"}
