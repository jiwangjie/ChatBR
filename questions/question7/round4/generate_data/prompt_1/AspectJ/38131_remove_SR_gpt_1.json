This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\npackage subpackage;\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior: The test.class file is put in the subpackage\\\\subpackage directory. This means running the java command results in an exception:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage.Test\n\nExpected Behavior: The behavior should be the same as javac.\n\nTo fix the problem, the following command can be used: ajc -d .", "OB": "The test.class file is put in the subpackage\\\\subpackage directory.
