{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc's outjar option, the resulting JAR file should contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file located at METAINF/MANIFEST.MF. However, currently, the generated JAR file does not have this manifest file. This is causing issues because certain tools and frameworks require the presence of MANIFEST.MF in a JAR file.", "OB": "When using ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, the resulting JAR file is created with a .jar extension, but it does not contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file located at METAINF/MANIFEST.MF.", "EB": "When using ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, the resulting JAR file should be a valid JAR file that includes a MANIFEST.MF file located at METAINF/MANIFEST.MF.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar'\n2. Verify that the output file '<my.jar' is created\n3. Attempt to view the contents of the JAR file and confirm that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file located at METAINF/MANIFEST.MF."}
