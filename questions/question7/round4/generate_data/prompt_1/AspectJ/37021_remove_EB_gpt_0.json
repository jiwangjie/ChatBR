The problem can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. The following limitations exist in the tests: these tests may return false positives because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. It has been observed in AJDT that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that sometimes filenames do not appear at all, although these specific tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'. Additionally, filenames should always appear in the declare warning messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Navigate to the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' directory.\n2. Run the provided code.\n3. Observe the source path in the declare warning messages for .class files from injars."}
