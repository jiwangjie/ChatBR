See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the issue. The current limitations of these tests are that they may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, it may simply omit it.)", "OB": "The observed behavior is not mentioned in the bug report.", "EB": "In declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is incorrectly listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "SR": "1. Compile the code provided in tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Run the compiled code.\n3. Observe the declare warning messages.\n4. Check if the source path for .class files from injars is listed correctly."}
