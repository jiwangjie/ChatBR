{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021: Source path is wrong in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When declaring warnings on binary files in Java and AspectJ projects, the source path is displayed incorrectly as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these cases are not reproducible with the provided test code. The issue may be related to AJDT, as it seems to omit the filename if it doesn't make sense in the context. To reproduce the problem, follow the steps mentioned in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings' directory.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. I have also observed cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages for binary files should be displayed correctly as 'app/Main', and all filenames should be included in the messages.", "SR": "1. Open the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings' directory. \n2. Run the provided code to see the incorrect source path and missing filenames in the declare warning messages."}
