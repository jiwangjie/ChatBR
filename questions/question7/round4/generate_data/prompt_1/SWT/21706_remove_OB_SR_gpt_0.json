Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it is unnecessary to allow instantiation of the class. The constructor should be made private to prevent it from being accessed from outside the class.", "SR": "1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 project.\n2. Remove the existing constructor.\n3. Add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class.\n4. Verify that the BidiUtil class cannot be instantiated from outside the class."}
