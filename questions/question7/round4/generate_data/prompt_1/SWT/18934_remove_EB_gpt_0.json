You can move them around, but they don't have any effect. When opening a small image, like an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they don't do anything.", "EB": "In the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars should be disabled, especially when opening a small image.", "SR": "Build F2 (20020602)Redhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only).\nTo reproduce:\n1.
