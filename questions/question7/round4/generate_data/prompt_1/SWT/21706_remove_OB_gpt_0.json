Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, there is no need to instantiate it. By adding a private constructor, we prevent people from mistakenly instantiating the class. The size of the class will not be affected as the compiler already provides a default public constructor.", "SR": "To address this issue, change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4). Please note that this change has not been tested, but it should have the same effect as the original code."}
