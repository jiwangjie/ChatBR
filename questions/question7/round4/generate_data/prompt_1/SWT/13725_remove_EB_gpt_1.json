Clicking 'no' on the dialog closes the file.\n2) Double-clicking on the file in the navigator reopens the file without saving changes.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nAfter marking the file as dirty, performing the steps mentioned above (closing and reopening the file) should take around 8 seconds.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Add a space character at the end of the first line to mark the file as dirty.\n3) Click on the close box in the editor tab and choose 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n4) Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n\nAdditionally, repeating steps 1 and 2 and then selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor should take approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original text.", "EB": "After marking the file as dirty, the process of closing and reopening the file should take approximately 8 seconds.
