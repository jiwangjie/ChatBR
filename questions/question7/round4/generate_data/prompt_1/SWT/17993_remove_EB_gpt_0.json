{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds a matching entry, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. However, this behavior is causing issues as it makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog, if there is a matching entry from the history, the typed entry is replaced with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, so the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by choosing Edit -> Find/Replace...\n2. Type 'a' into the Find field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the Find field. Verify that the typed entry is not replaced with a value from the history."}
