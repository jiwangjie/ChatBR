{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "The behavior of the Find/Replace function is not desirable. Currently, when typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the system replaces the typed entry with a value from the search history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is common in browsers. It would be better if the system does not automatically replace the typed entry and instead provides a full autocomplete feature in the future.", "OB": "When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the system replaces the typed entry with a value from the search history.", "EB": "When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the system should not replace the typed entry with a value from the search history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  1. Open the application and go to Edit > Find/Replace...  2. Type any character in the Find field.  3. Click on the Find button.  4. Try to type a different character in the Find field. "}
