Add the following line to the performPaint method of StyledText: System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);\n2. Append N lines to the StyledText in word wrap mode.\n3. Observe that the entire client area is redrawn N times, which is inefficient."}
