This seems unexpected, as reverting the file contents should not take longer than closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "When closing the file and reopening it in the java editor, it takes about 8 seconds. However, when selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor after making the file dirty, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "Upon selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it is expected that the contents of the window are replaced with the original in a similar or faster time period as closing and reopening the file. ", "SR": "1) Start by opening an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open-source repository. 2) Select the end of the first line, and add a space character to mark the file as dirty. 3) Click on the close box in the editor tab and answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. 4) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. 5) Again, select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty. 6) Right-click to open the pop-up menu in the editor and select 'Revert'.
