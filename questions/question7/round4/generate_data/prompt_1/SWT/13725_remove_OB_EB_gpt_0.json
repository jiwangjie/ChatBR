{"id": "13725", "title": "Bug 13725 - Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "description": "When using the Java editor, the 'Revert' functionality is significantly slower compared to the 'Close and Reopen' functionality.", "OB": "After opening the 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' file in the 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' source folder of the 'org.eclipse.swt' project, I made the file dirty by adding a space character at the end of the first line. Upon performing the following steps, I observed the following behavior:\n- Clicked on the close box in the editor tab.\n- Selected 'No' when prompted to save changes.\n- Double-clicked on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\nOn my fast home machine, these steps took around 8 seconds to complete.", "EB": "I expected the 'Revert' functionality to be equally fast, taking similar or lesser time to replace the contents of the window with the original content.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' file in the 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' source folder of the 'org.eclipse.swt' project.\n2. Add a space character at the end of the first line to mark the file as dirty.\n3. Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n4. Select 'No' when prompted to save changes.\n5. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\nExpected result: The file should reopen with the original content in a time similar to or faster than the 'Close and Reopen' functionality.\nActual result: The 'Revert' functionality takes significantly more time, around 15 seconds, to replace the contents of the window with the original content."}
