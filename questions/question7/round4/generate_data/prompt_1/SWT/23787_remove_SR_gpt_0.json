{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "Integration build 09/17. The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields as it looks bad on all Motif platforms.", "OB": "On Windows, the appearance of the text fields is fine. However, on Motif platforms, these text fields all get automatic borders, which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which make them stand out much worse.", "EB": "The text fields should be created as readonly text fields instead of labels. I guess this is so that their values can be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": "1. Open the Project Properties Info page on a Motif platform.\n2. Observe the appearance of the text fields, including the automatic borders and different colored backgrounds.\n3. Compare the appearance of the text fields on Windows to that on Motif platforms.\n4. Consider changing the text fields to readonly text fields to prevent them from being identified as user input targets."}
