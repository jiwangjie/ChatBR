In the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class, there is a line of code that uses Class.forName() to initialize a static Callback object.", "EB": "The line of code that uses Class.forName() to initialize the static Callback object should be modified to remove the reflection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use the CLDC version of SWT and verify or use jxeLink. Then, try to run the program and observe the NoClassDefFoundError that is thrown as a result of the line of code in org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil that uses Class.forName(). To fix the issue, modify the code in BidiUtil to remove the reflection and directly initialize the Callback object."}
