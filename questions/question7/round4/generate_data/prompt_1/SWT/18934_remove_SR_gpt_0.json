Note that the scrollbars are currently enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect. When opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they do not perform any action.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled to avoid confusion and provide a better user experience.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Launch the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Open a small image, like an icon.\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect."}
