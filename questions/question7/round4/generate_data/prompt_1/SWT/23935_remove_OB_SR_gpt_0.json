{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the attached code in build 20020920, the right tree and text widget do not lose focus correctly.", "EB": "When running the attached code in build 20020920, the right tree and text widget should lose focus correctly like the left tree and text widget on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run the attached code in build 20020920.\n2. Observe the behavior of the right tree and text widget with regards to losing focus.\n3. Compare the behavior with the left tree and text widget on both Windows and Linux."}
