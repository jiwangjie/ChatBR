{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "The Project Properties Info page is using text fields, which is causing display issues on motif platforms. On Windows, the page appears fine, but on motif platforms, the text fields have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which make them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields used on the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, identifying them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should use a different UI element instead of text fields, such as labels or read-only fields. On motif platforms, the text fields should not have automatic borders, and on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, the fields should have the same background color as the rest of the page.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Select a Project\n2. Right-click and select Properties\n3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the text fields used for readonly fields such as Path, Type, etc."}
