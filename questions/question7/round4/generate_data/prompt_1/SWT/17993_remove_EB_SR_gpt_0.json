{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When I type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what I have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what I have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "When I type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the previously entered text should not be replaced with a value from the history. The search of the history should remain case insensitive, but the original case of what I type should not be altered. This will ensure that find and replace operations can be performed successfully.", "SR": "1. Open the application and navigate to the Edit menu.\n2. Select 'Find/Replace...' to open the Find/Replace dialog.\n3. Type a new value in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field.\n4. Ensure that the value you typed is not replaced by a suggestion from the history.\n5. Perform a find or replace operation and verify that it works as expected."}
