{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. The behavior should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Navigate to the Edit menu and select Find/Replace...\n3. Observe that the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Perform various find and replace operations, ensuring the behavior allows the full range of operations to be performed without replacing the typed entry with a value from the history.\nNote: Similar behavior should also be verified for the 'Replace With' field."}
