{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in Java editor.", "description": "When I select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor window while having a file open in the Java editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original. This issue does not occur when I close and reopen the file. However, I have observed that this slow behavior only happens when I answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog before closing the file. If I repeat the steps of answering 'no' to the dialog and double-clicking on the file in the navigator to reopen it, the 'Revert' operation still takes 15 seconds each time.", "OB": "The 'Revert' operation in the Java editor takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file when the 'do you want to save changes' dialog is answered 'no' and the file is reopened by double-clicking on it in the navigator.", "EB": "", "SR": "1.
