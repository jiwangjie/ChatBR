{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "When the view, such as the Navigator, is resized smaller, the two tool items move below the label instead of staying on the same line. This causes a usability problem as users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located on the far right corner.", "OB": "When resizing the view, the tool items move below the label.", "EB": "The tool items should stay on the same line as the label, regardless of the size of the view.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the application on Linux.\n2. Go to the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n4. Observe that the tool items move below the label."}
