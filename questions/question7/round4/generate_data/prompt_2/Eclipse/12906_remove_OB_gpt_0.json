Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a java file by simply double clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. \n\nCurrently, nothing happens when trying to open the file in another editor. However, the workbench should display a warning message saying that you may overwrite changes and ask if you want to continue, or display an error message stating that the file cannot be opened in another editor until it's closed in the current editor. We believe this is a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."}
