{"id": "2345", "title": "Bug 2345 - Open with a different type of editor has no effect if file is already open", "description": "When trying to open a file with a different type of editor while the file is already open, no changes are observed. The issue can be reproduced by following the steps in the 1GEWMOZ: ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example. A new basic project needs to be created and a new file named test.xml should be added. The default editor used for XML files is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content. Selecting test.xml in the Navigator and choosing 'Open With...' followed by 'Default Text Editor' does not open the file with the expected editor - instead, the scripted resource editor example is reactivated. It is expected that searching for an existing open file should consider the editor types and open a new editor for the file when the editor type is different. This is not currently happening.", "OB": "When selecting 'Open With...' and then 'Default Text Editor' for the test.xml file in the Navigator, the file does not open with the expected editor. Instead, the scripted resource editor example, which is already open, remains active.", "EB": "When selecting 'Open With...' and then 'Default Text Editor' for the test.xml file in the Navigator, the file should open with the expected editor, regardless of whether the scripted resource editor example is already open.", "SR": "1.
