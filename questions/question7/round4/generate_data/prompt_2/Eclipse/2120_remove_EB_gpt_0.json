Additionally, it is mentioned that the implementation should use IPersistableElement and not peek into the underlying resource via IEditorInput.", "OB": "During the current session, the files appear in the File menu MRU list.", "EB": "After restarting the workbench, the files should still appear in the File menu MRU list.", "SR": "1.
