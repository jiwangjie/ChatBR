{"id": "2940", "title": "Bug 2940 - Export Zip: Updating of checkboxes does not show busy cursor", "description": "When updating the checked state of the table in the Export Zip feature, it takes a long time (30 seconds in my case) for the changes to be reflected on the screen. This delay should be accompanied by a busy cursor to indicate that the application is processing the request.", "OB": "Currently, there is no indication that the application is processing the request, and it takes a long time (30 seconds in my case) for the changes to be reflected on the screen.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the application to display a busy cursor during the update process, providing visual feedback to the user. Additionally, the updating of the checked state should be quicker, reducing the delay to a reasonable time frame.", "SR": "1. Open the Export Zip feature.\n2. Make changes to the checked state of the table entries.\n3. Observe the delay in the update process and the lack of a busy cursor to indicate that the changes are being processed."}
