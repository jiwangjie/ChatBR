", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not resize correctly when the string value is wider than the column width. As a result, the drop-down button of the combo box may be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object using the name-value pairs in two columns.\n3. Set the column width of column two to be narrower than the widest string value.\n4. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not resize to fit the widest string value, causing the drop-down button to be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
