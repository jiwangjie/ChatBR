Currently, no warning or error message is displayed.", "OB": "1. Close any open files in the workbench.\n2. Go to the Java Perspective.\n3. Open a Java file by double-clicking on it in the Project Explorer.\n4. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n5. Right-click on the same Java file.\n6. Select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n7. Observe that nothing happens. There should be a warning message informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue, or an error message stating that all files must be closed first.\n\nWe believe this is a safety feature where the IDE does not allow external editing while the file is already opened in the IDE.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
