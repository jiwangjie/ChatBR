{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. It does not adjust its width to match the column width of the property sheet.", "EB": "I would expect the ComboBoxCellEditor to always be the same width as the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as the DialogCellEditor (with the button always visible). We need to investigate whether this is a issue with our implementation or with SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet. \n2. Add a property with a ComboBoxCellEditor. \n3. Notice that the width of the ComboBoxCellEditor does not match the width of the property sheet column."}
