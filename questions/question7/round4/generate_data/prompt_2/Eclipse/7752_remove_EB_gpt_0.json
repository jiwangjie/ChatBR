Launch WSWB and create two projects. \n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as 'foo.txt'). \n3. From the main menu, select 'File' and then 'Export'. \n4. In the export dialog window, select both projects, give the zip file a name (such as 'test.zip') and begin the export to the zip file. \n\nExpected behavior: The files should be successfully exported to the zip file without any errors. \n\nObserved behavior: An error message box pops up, indicating that problems were encountered during export. The details in the error message list the file with the same name in 'project2' as the problem.", "OB": "An error message box pops up, indicating that problems were encountered during export.
