Close the file if it is already open in the editor.\n2. Go to the Java Perspective.\n3. Open a Java file by double-clicking on it.\n4. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n5. Right-click on the Java file.\n6. Select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n7. Nothing happens.\n\nThe workbench should display a warning message indicating that opening the file may overwrite changes and prompting to confirm the action, or an error message stating that all files need to be closed first.\n\nThis behavior seems to be a safety feature in WSAD where external editing is not allowed while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
