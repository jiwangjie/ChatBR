{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Bug 3970 - The Windows workstations used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes) are currently using the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\") when creating a new file. However, this is not always what a user wants. The end product is a Unix product, so even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters. Therefore, a UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for the line delimiter are:\n- Dos / Windows\n- Mac\n- Unix\n- Default platform line delimiter. \nAll plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.
