There is no warning message or error message displayed.", "EB": "The workbench should display a warning message stating that opening the file in another editor may result in overwriting changes, and asking if the user wants to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed stating that all files need to be closed first before opening the file in another editor. We believe this is a safety feature intended to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "SR": "1. Open a file in the Java Perspective by double-clicking on it.\n2. Right-click on the same file.\n3. Select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n4. Observe that nothing happens, and no warning or error message is displayed."}
