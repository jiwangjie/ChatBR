{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message:\n\nnews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nI have found a bug in the ComboBoxCellEditor. The combo box does not size correctly in the property sheet.\n\nOB: The ComboBoxCellEditor does not adjust its width to match the column of the property sheet.\n\nEB: I expected the behavior where the combo box would always be the same width as the property sheet column. Note that DialogCellEditor (with the button always visible) works correctly, so I need to investigate whether this issue is specific to us or the SWT library.\n\nSR: To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet that contains a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n2. Observe that the combo box does not adjust its width to match the property sheet column.\n3. Compare this with DialogCellEditor, where the button's width is correctly adjusted to match the column in the property sheet.\n"}
