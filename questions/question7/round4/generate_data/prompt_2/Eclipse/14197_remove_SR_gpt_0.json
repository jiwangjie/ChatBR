{"id": "14197", "title": "Removing a working set immediately causes changes in package view filtering", "description": "Upon deleting a working set, the package view in the background is immediately refiltered. However, I believe the refiltering should only occur when closing the working set selection dialog, not during the manipulation process. Additionally, I expect that pressing cancel should revert any changes made to the working sets, including canceling the remove operation.", "OB": "1. Create a working set with one project and select it. 2. Open the package view. The view should be filtered based on the working set.", "EB": "When deleting a working set, the package view should remain as it is until the working set selection dialog is closed. Pressing cancel should undo any changes made to the working sets.", "SR": "1. Create a working set with one project and select it. 2. Open the package view. 3. Delete the working set. 4. Observe that the package view remains unchanged. 5. Close the working set selection dialog without saving. 6. Observe that the package view is still unchanged and the delete operation has been canceled."}
