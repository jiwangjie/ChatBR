Create a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml' in the project.\n3. Ensure that the 'Scripted Resource Editor Example' is set as the default editor for XML files.\n4. Open 'test.xml' in the 'Scripted Resource Editor Example' by double-clicking it in the Navigator.\n5. With 'test.xml' still open in the 'Scripted Resource Editor Example', right-click 'test.xml' in the Navigator.\n6. Select 'Open With...' > 'Default Text Editor'.\n\nExpected result: A new editor should open for 'test.xml' in the 'Default Text Editor'.\n\nNotes: Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types."}
