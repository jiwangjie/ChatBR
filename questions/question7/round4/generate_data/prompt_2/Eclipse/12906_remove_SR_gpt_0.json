Switch to the Java Perspective.\n2. Double-click on a java file to open it in the workbench.\n3. Right-click on the Java file.\n4. Click on 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n5. Observe that nothing happens.\n\nThe expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue, or an error message should be displayed, stating that all files should be closed first. We believe this is a safety feature where the IDE doesn't allow external editing while a file is already opened in the IDE.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning message displayed.", "SR": "1. Close the file that is currently opened in the editor.\n2. Repeat steps 1-4 mentioned in OB.\n3. Observe that a warning message is displayed, indicating that the file is already opened and asking if you want to continue."}
