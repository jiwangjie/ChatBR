However, it now moves down when the view is resized smaller. This behavior is causing usability issues as users expect the close button to be on the same line as the label and located in the far right corner.", "OB": "When the view is resized smaller, the close button moves down below the label.", "EB": "The close button should stay on the same line as the label even when the view is resized smaller.", "SR": "1. Open the view.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Check if the close button stays on the same line as the label or moves down."}
