{"id": "12906", "title": "Bug 12906 - Unable to open a file in a new editor when it is already opened in another editor", "description": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open the same file in another editor does nothing. However, it should display a warning message in the workbench stating that there may be unsaved changes and asking if the user wants to continue. Alternatively, it should display an error message stating that all files must be closed first before opening the file. We believe this is a safety feature implemented to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the editor.", "OB": "1. Open a file in the workbench.\n2. Right-click on the opened file.\n3. Select 'Open With' > 'System Editor'.\n4. Nothing happens. No warning or error message is displayed.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
