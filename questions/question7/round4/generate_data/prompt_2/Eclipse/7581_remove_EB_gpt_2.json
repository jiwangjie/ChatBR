{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the PropertySheetViewer does not resize correctly when the width of the items in the dropdown list is larger than the width of the column. This causes the dropdown button to be clipped and not visible within the property sheet.", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, the ComboBoxCellEditor appears in column two of the property sheet. If any of the strings in the dropdown list are wider than the column width, the dropdown button is off the visible area of the property sheet and gets clipped. The user cannot see the dropdown button without expanding the property sheet view wider.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a PropertySheetViewer with a column that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor as the cell editor.\n2. Use strings in the dropdown list that are wider than the column width.\n3. Open the property sheet and observe that the dropdown button is off the visible area and clipped.\n\nExpected behavior: The ComboBoxCellEditor should resize itself to ensure that the dropdown button is always visible within the property sheet."}
