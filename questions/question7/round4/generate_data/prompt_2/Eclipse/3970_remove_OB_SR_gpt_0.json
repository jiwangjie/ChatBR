{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Bug 3970 - Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse since they are cheaper than Unix boxes. However, when a new file is created on Windows, it is not given Unix line delimiters, which is necessary since the end product is a Unix product. Therefore, a UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values for line delimiters should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins to ensure that all new files have the same line delimiter.", "OB": "Currently, when a new file is created on a Windows workstation, it does not have Unix line delimiters.", "EB": "The new file created on a Windows workstation should have Unix line delimiters, as it is necessary for the end product which is a Unix product.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiters of the new file."}
