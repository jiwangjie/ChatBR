{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows editing of objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns, each defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this method to create editors that include a ComboBoxCellEditor. The constructor of ComboBoxCellEditor can be given an array of strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet, with the drop-down button appearing at the right edge of the column.\n\nA problem occurs when any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. The combo box grows to be the width of the largest item, causing the drop-down button to be too far to the right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in it being clipped. As a result, users are unable to see the drop-down button unless they make the property sheet view wider to bring the button into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly when any of the strings in the drop-down list is wider than the width of the property sheet column. This causes the drop-down button to be too far to the right and outside the visible area, resulting in it being clipped.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Set a string value for any property in the property sheet that is wider than the width of the column.\n3. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly and the drop-down button is outside the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in it being clipped."}
