{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On Linux, when running build 20011127 (this issue does not occur on build 20011116 on Nt2000), if a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label. This behavior may confuse users.", "EB": "These two tool items should stay on the same line as the label, regardless of how small the view is. This is expected behavior and improves usability. Users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": ""}
