{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug #6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "The close button moves down when the view, such as the Navigator, is resized smaller on Linux, specifically when running build 20011127 (this issue does not occur on build 20011116 on Nt2000). The tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), also move below the label. This behavior may confuse users.", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), move below the label.", "EB": "The tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), should stay on the same line as the label regardless of how small the view is. This is important for usability, as users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": "1. Launch the application on Linux.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n4. Observe that the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), move below the label."}
