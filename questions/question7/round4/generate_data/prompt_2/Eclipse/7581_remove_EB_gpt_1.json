{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester wrote in a message... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. When a ComboBoxCellEditor is used in the property sheet viewer, the editor appears in column two of the property sheet and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column. However, if any of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item. As a result, the drop-down button may be pushed beyond the visible area of the property sheet and gets clipped. Therefore, users cannot see the drop-down button without widening the property sheet view until the button comes into the visible area.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue in the PropertySheetViewer:\n1. Create a property sheet with a column layout, where each row represents a name-value pair.\n2. Use an IPropertyDescriptor to define the columns and to create a cell editor for the second column.\n3. Use the ComboBoxCellEditor constructor and pass in a list of strings as options.\n4. Set the property sheet viewer to display the created property sheet.\n5. Ensure that at least one of the strings in the combo box list is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n6. Observe that the combo box grows to fit the widest string, but the drop-down button may get clipped and become invisible.\n\nExpected behavior: The ComboBoxCellEditor should size itself correctly in the property sheet, ensuring that the drop-down button is always visible within the visible area of the property sheet."}
