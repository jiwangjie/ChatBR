{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester (JoeWin@us.ibm.com) wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer lets me edit objects using a set of rows that are name value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the IPropertyDescriptor method to create a cell editor, specifically the ComboBoxCellEditor, which can be given a list of strings. The cell editor appears in column two of the property sheet and the drop down button appears at the right edge of the column.\n\nA problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It seems that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The problem is that the drop down button may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, thus getting clipped. As a result, users are unable to see the combo drop down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet if any of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column. As a result, the drop down button is positioned too far right and gets clipped off the visible area of the property sheet, making it impossible for users to see and interact with the combo drop down button.", "EB": "I would have expected the ComboBoxCellEditor to always be the same width as the property sheet column. This means that the combo box and the drop down button are fully visible within the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object using the rows that are name value pairs in two columns.\n3. Ensure that any of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item, causing the drop down button to be positioned too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, thus getting clipped.\n\nNote: It is unclear whether this issue is specific to our application or a general issue with SWT. Further investigation is required to determine the cause."}
