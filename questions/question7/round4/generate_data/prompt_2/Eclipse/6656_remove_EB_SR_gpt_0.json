When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. This behavior might confuse users.", "OB": "When resizing a view like the Navigator to a smaller size, the close button (X) and the pulldown menu icon (triangle) move down below the label.", "EB": "When resizing a view like the Navigator to a smaller size, the close button (X) and the pulldown menu icon (triangle) should remain aligned with the label, without moving down.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view on Linux with build 20011127.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Observe the position of the close button (X) and the pulldown menu icon (triangle) relative to the label."}
