", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. It does not fill the whole width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box in the ComboBoxCellEditor to always be the width of the property sheet column. This behavior should be the same as the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  1. Open the property sheet. 2. Edit a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor. 3. Observe that the combo box does not fill the whole width of the property sheet column. 4. Compare it with the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible."}
