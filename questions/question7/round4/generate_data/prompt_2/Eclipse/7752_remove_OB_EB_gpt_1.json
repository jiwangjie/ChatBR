Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt').\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' -> 'Export' and choose 'Zip File' to export.\n", "OB": "When exporting the files to a zip file, the export process fails to create the zip file correctly. Instead, the exported files are not properly organized within the zip file and it becomes difficult to distinguish between the files with the same name.", "EB": "When exporting files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, the export process should maintain the directory structure and properly organize the files within the zip file, so that it is easy to differentiate between the files with the same name.", "SR": "1.
