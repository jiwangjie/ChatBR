The Windows workstations are being used as X terminals and to run Eclipse because they are cheaper than Unix boxes.\n\nCurrently, there is no option available in the preferences menu to define the default line delimiters for new files. This is causing an inconvenience for developers who are working on both Unix and Windows workstations.\n\nIt is important to have a UI in the preferences menu where users can define the default line delimiters for new files. This will ensure that the line delimiters are consistent across different platforms and will help maintain the integrity of the codebase.\n\nPlease add the missing UI to define the default line delimiters for new files in the preferences menu.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Go to the preferences menu.\n3. Look for an option to define the default line delimiters for new files.\n\nExpected result:\n- There should be a UI available in the preferences menu to define the default line delimiters for new files.\n\nObserved result:\n- The option to define the default line delimiters for new files is missing from the preferences menu."}
