{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "When using ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet, if any of the strings in the drop-down list is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item. However, this causes the drop-down button to be positioned too far to the right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in it being clipped.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size correctly in the property sheet and ensure that the drop-down button is always visible within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the PropertySheetViewer. 2. Create a set of row that are name value pairs in two columns. 3. Define each column using an IPropertyDescriptor. 4. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create a cell editor that includes ComboBoxCellEditor. 5. Set the width of the property sheet column to be narrower than the widest item in the drop-down list. 6. Observe that the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be positioned too far to the right and outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
