The Scripted Resource Editor example should no longer be the active editor.", "SR": "Reproduce the steps to replicate the issue: 1. Open the Scripted Resource Editor example. 2. Create a new basic project. 3. Create a new XML file named 'test.xml'. 4. With the 'test.xml' file selected in the Navigator, choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'. 5. Verify that nothing happens and the Scripted Resource Editor example is still the active editor. \n\nThe expected result is that a new editor with the Default Text Editor should open for the 'test.xml' file, and the Scripted Resource Editor example should no longer be the active editor. \n\nNOTES: Searching for an existing open file should also consider the editor types."}
