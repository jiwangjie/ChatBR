{"id": "7752", "title": "Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce:", "OB": "No observed behavior provided", "EB": "When exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, the files are not exported correctly. For example, if there are two projects in WSWB and each project has a file named 'foo.txt', when exporting the files to a zip file, only one of the 'foo.txt' files is included in the zip file (e.g., 'foo.txt' from project 1), while the other 'foo.txt' file (e.g., 'foo.txt' from project 2) is missing.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch WSWB and create two projects. 2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name, such as 'foo.txt'. 3. From the main menu, select File > Export and choose the 'Zip File' option to export. 4. Observe that only one of the 'foo.txt' files is included in the exported zip file instead of both files."}
