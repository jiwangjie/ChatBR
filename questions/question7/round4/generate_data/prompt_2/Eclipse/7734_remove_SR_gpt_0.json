Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nResult: There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty file(s). The computer is shut down/rebooted immediately."}
