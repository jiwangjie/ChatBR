The file simply does not open in the new editor.", "EB": "When attempting to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor, the workbench should display a warning message indicating that making changes in multiple editors may cause conflicts and ask if the user wants to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed stating that the file must be closed in the other editor before opening in a new editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
