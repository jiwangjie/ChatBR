{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED int Widget dispose() void Widget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(). But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should recognize that 'dispose()' matches the typed '(' and insert it as the auto-complete suggestion.", "SR": "1. Launch Build 204. 2. Write SWT code and type 'button.dispose'. 3. Without looking at the code assist list, type '('. Observe the suggestion inserted by the automatic code assist."}
