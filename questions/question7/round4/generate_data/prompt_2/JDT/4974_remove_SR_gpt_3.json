This occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, which creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Similar to the validation process, the setting of the classpath and output location should be combined into a single action. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
