{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files and can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When creating a new project for an existing directory structure with the output folder set to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, the system does not confirm if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "The system should display a confirmation message to the user, asking if they want to proceed with deleting and rebuilding the output directory.", "SR": "1. Go to the project creation page.\n2. Select an existing directory structure.\n3. Set the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n4. Attempt to create the project.\n5. Verify that a confirmation message is displayed, asking if the user wants to proceed with deleting and rebuilding the output directory."}
