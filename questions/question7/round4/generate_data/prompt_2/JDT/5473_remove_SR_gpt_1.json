{"id": "5473", "title": "ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Build 200110251. When using the ShiftLeft function with intermixed tabs and spaces, the behavior is not as expected. In the first scenario, if the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually, and then ShiftLeft is executed, the text does not shift correctly. It is unclear how this is specified, but it seems that both the first and second lines should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). Currently, if there is a stray space, it is confusing because the text does not shift as expected.", "OB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.
