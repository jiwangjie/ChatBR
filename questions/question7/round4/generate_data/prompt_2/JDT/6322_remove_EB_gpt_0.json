{"id": "6322", "title": "All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "When using JDK 1.4, obfuscated classes (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') are displayed prominently in the Open Type dialog. This makes it difficult to find the desired classes.", "OB": "The obfuscated classes are shown prominently in the Open Type dialog.", "EB": "The Open Type dialog should not display obfuscated classes.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, there are two possible options:\n\na) Sort the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter.\n\nb) Filter out the obfuscated classes completely. I suggest option (a) as it would still allow users to access these classes if needed."}
