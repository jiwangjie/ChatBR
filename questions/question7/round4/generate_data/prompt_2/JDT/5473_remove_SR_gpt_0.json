It is unclear whether this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Most importantly, there seems to be confusion when there is a stray space, as it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually indent both lines equally, executing the ShiftLeft command should shift the second line to the left. Additionally, the first line should be shifted left, at least until the space character is reached (i.e., removing the tab). It is important to note that the presence of a stray space must not cause confusion, and the text should shift as expected.", "SR": ""}
