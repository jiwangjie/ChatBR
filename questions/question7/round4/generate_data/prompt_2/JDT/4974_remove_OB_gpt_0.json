{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "The bug report is requesting that the setting of the classpath and output location should be offered as one operation, similar to how the validation for checking classpath and output location is done at once. Additionally, the error message when the classpath and output location are nested is considered strange and should be improved.", "OB": "The bug report does not provide an observed behavior.", "EB": "The setting of classpath and output location should be combined into one operation. The error message when the classpath and output location are nested should state: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. In the project properties, change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
