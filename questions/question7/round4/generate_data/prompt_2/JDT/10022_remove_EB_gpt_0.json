{"id": "10022", "title": "Incorrect \"Build\" popup action enablement", "description": "The bug report is about the incorrect enablement of the \"Build\" action in the context-sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective. Even if the user goes to Preferences -> Workbench and selects \"Perform build automatically on resource modification\", the build menu option still appears in the Java popup menus. This behavior is believed to be incorrect.", "OB": "In the Java perspective, the \"Build\" action in the context-sensitive popup menu is always enabled, despite the user selecting \"Perform build automatically on resource modification\" in Preferences.", "EB": "In the Java perspective, the \"Build\" action in the context-sensitive popup menu should only be enabled if the user has not selected \"Perform build automatically on resource modification\" in Preferences.", "SR": "The bug can be reproduced by following these steps: 1. Open the Java perspective. 2. Go to Preferences -> Workbench. 3. Select \"Perform build automatically on resource modification\". 4. Right-click on a resource in the Java perspective and observe that the \"Build\" action is still enabled in the popup menu."}
