{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions available on text selection seem to be distributed based on personal preference. This should be changed to make it clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views just to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the editor and select some text.\n2. Right-click on the selected text to bring up the context menu.\n3. Verify that the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not present in the context menu."}
