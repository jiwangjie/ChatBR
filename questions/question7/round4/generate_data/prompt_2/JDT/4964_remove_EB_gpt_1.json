{"id": "4964", "title": "Automatic Code Assist inserts incorrect code", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204. While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose(). I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: 'button.dispose();' But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "After typing 'button.dispose' and '(' in the code, the automatic code assist should suggest 'dispose()' as the best match based on the context. It should not insert 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor in Build 204.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Observe the code assist list that appears.\n4. Type '(' after 'button.dispose'.\n5. Observe if the code assist inserts the correct suggestion based on the context."}
