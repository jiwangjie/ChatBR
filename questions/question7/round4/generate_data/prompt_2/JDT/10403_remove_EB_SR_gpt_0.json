{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation message that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. As a result, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the application\n2. Create a new project\n3. Choose an existing directory structure as the project location\n4. Point the output folder to a directory that contains non-.class files\n5. Try to create the project\n\nExpected behavior: There should be a confirmation message stating that the output directory will be deleted and rebuilt. The user should be able to proceed with the project creation only after confirming this action."}
