{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be combined into one operation", "description": "When attempting to set the output location and classpath in a project, two separate operations are required. This leads to the creation of an illegal state if the output location is set before the classpath. The following bug report aims to address this issue and suggests combining the setting of classpath and output location into a single operation.", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after setting the output location and classpath separately, an error message appears stating 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "The error message should not appear, and the output location and classpath should be set correctly without creating any illegal states.", "SR": "1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location.\n4. Press 'Ok' to save the changes."}
