{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist selecting incorrect suggestion", "description": "When typing the code 'button.dispose', the automatic Code Assist feature selects 'DISPOSED' as the suggestion instead of 'dispose()'. This is incorrect as 'dispose()' is a more accurate match. As a result, the incorrect code 'button.DISPOSED' is inserted and I have to manually delete it and start over. The Code Assist feature should be smarter in recognizing that the '(' character indicates a method call and prioritize suggestions that match the typed characters more closely. Alternatively, the feature should be case-sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "When typing the code 'button.dispose', the automatic Code Assist feature selects 'DISPOSED' as the suggestion instead of 'dispose()'.", "EB": "When typing the code 'button.dispose', the automatic Code Assist feature should select 'dispose()' as the suggestion.", "SR": "1.
