Here is an example:\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}\n\nTo reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Change the baz call to:\n   baz(x.x.foo())\n2. Place the cursor after the first \"x.\"\n3. Press CtrlSpace to bring up the code assist\n4. Type \"f\" to filter the list\n5. Select \"foo()\"\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nThe code assist should only replace the selected portion of code and not consume additional code.\n", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\nbaz(x.foo().x.foo())", "EB": "The code assist should only replace the selected portion of code and not consume additional code.", "SR": "Change the baz call to\n\nbaz(x.x.foo())\n\nPlace the cursor after the first \"x.\"\n\nPress CtrlSpace to bring up the code assist\n\nType \"f\" to filter the list\n\nSelect \"foo()\"\n"}
