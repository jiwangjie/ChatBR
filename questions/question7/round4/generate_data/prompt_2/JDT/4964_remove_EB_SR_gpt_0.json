{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist inserts incorrect code", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type the '(', automatic code assist inserts whatever is selected.", "OB": "Build 204", "EB": "Automatic code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. It should either prioritize the matching function or be case sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "SR": "1. Open an SWT code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'\n3. Observe the code assist list with items 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'.\n4. Type '(' after 'dispose'\n5. Note that automatic code assist inserts the selected item from the list, instead of the desired 'dispose()' function."}
