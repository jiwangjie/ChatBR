{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the confirmation for deleting and rebuilding the output directory is not displayed.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, a confirmation should be displayed to confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, create a new project for an existing directory structure. Ensure the output folder is pointed at a bin directory which contains additional files besides .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files. Observe that no confirmation is shown for deleting and rebuilding the output directory."}
