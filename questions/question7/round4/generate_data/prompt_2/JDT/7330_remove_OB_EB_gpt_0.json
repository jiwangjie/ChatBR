I had to switch to the Outline view to locate this action. It seems that the actions are currently distributed based on personal preference, which is confusing. I believe all actions should be easily accessible to users, either through the context menu or other means in the editor. It is not acceptable to require users to switch views.", "OB": "When I select text in the editor, the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "When I select text in the editor, the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be visible in the context menu.", "SR": "1.
