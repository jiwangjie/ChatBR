{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654 - Modify Parameters: Dialog details", "description": "The bug report is about the Modify Parameters dialog. The reported issues are as follows:\n\na. The buttons are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\ng. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.\n\nThe suggested improvements are:\n\n- The marking between the button and the list is too large.\n\n- The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\n\nc. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n\nd. Multiple selection should be allowed, as Move Up / Move Down can be applied on more than one item.\n\nf. The signature preview must be a label that wraps.\n\nIt would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.\n\nh. \n", "OB": "1.
