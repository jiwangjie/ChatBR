{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Canceling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. It should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button, by passing 'false' for the 'cancellable' parameter when calling 'ProgressMonitorDialog.run'.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Open the debug perspective and go to the breakpoints pane. 2) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception breakpoint. 3) In the progress dialog, click the 'Cancel' button."}
