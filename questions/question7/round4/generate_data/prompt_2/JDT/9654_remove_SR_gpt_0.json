{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters - Dialog details", "description": "When modifying parameters in the 'Modify Parameters' dialog, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:\n\ni. The duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second columns in the dialog could be merged.", "OB": "- The buttons in the dialog are too small.\n- When the dialog opens, no table entry is selected.\n- Both move buttons are enabled even when there is no selected item.\n- When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n- The dialog becomes extremely large for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "- The marking between the top button and the list is too large.\n- The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog.\n- The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n- Multiple selection should be allowed, as the move up/down functionality can be applied to more than one item.\n- The signature preview must be a label that wraps text.\n- It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": ""}
