The first and second columns could be merged.", "OB": "The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed, as Move Up/Down can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "EB": "The marking between the button and list should be reduced to an appropriate size. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog. The table should have a label to provide a mnemonic. The dialog should support multiple selections so that Move Up/Down can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview should wrap long text. Additionally, the background color of the signature preview should match the hover color.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, change a parameter name to something very long and observe that the preview is cut off."}
