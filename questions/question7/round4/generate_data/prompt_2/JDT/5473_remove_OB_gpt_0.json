It is confusing when there is a stray space preventing the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor. \n2. Type in the following lines: \n   - Some text\n   - Some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines and execute the ShiftLeft command. \n   - Note that nothing moves."}
