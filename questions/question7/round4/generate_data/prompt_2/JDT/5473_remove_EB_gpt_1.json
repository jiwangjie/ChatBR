{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251. ", "OB": "When replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually and executing the ShiftLeft command, the text does not move. This behavior is confusing, as it is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Stray spaces make it unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open a default text editor and type in the following: \n   <space><tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n2. Highlight the two lines above and execute the ShiftLeft command.\n3. Observe that nothing moves."}
