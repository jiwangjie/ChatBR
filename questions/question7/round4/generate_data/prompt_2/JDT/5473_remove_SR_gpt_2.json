Instead, it stays in the same position. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). However, there is a stray space present, making it difficult to determine why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character with spaces in the first line to visually align both lines, executing ShiftLeft should move the text accordingly. In the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least until the space character (i.e., removing the tab). There should not be any stray spaces present. This will ensure that the behavior is clear and consistent.", "SR": ""}
