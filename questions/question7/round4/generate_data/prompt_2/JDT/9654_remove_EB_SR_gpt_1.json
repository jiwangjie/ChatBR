{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters: Dialog details", "description": "The bug report states that there are some issues with the Modify Parameters dialog details. It mentions that there could be duplicated name validation performed on the first page. Additionally, it suggests merging the first and second columns. The observed behavior includes the buttons being too small, when the dialog comes up no table entry is selected, both move buttons are enabled, the preview is cut off when changing a parameter name to something very long, and the dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters. The expected behavior and steps to reproduce are missing from the bug report.", "OB": "a. The buttons in the Modify Parameters dialog are too small. b.
