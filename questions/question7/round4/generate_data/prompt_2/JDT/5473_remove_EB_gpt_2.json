It is not clear why the text won't shift. There should be consistency in the behavior. In the first scenario, it seems like both the second line and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, getting rid of the tab. Additionally, having a stray space in the text makes it confusing.", "EB": "When the tab character on the first line is replaced with spaces and the ShiftLeft is executed, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character. Stray spaces should not prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a default text editor. 2. Type in the following: <space><tab>some text<tab>some text2. 3. Highlight the two lines above. 4. Execute ShiftLeft. Observe that nothing moves."}
