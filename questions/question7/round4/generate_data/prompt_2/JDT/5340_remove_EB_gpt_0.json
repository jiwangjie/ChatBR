{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog immediately closes and the exception list appears, despite the cancellation request. This behavior should be changed so that either the cancellation request is honored or the cancel button is disabled during the process. Currently, the call to ProgressMonitorDialog.run does not pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter, causing this issue.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the '+' button to add an exception breakpoint. 3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
