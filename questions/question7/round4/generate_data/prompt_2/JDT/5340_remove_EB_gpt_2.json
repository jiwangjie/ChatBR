{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. However, the exception list still appears despite the cancellation request. The expected behavior is either for the cancellation request to be honored and the exception list not to appear, or for the cancel button to be disabled during the process (by passing false for the 'cancelable' parameter when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run).", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately upon clicking cancel. However, the exception list still appears despite the cancellation request.", "EB": "When adding an exception breakpoint and then clicking cancel in the progress dialog, the process should either be cancelled and the exception list should not appear, or the cancel button should be disabled during the process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Open the debug perspective in the IDE\n2) Go to the breakpoints pane\n3) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception breakpoint\n4) In the progress dialog that appears, click the 'cancel' button."}
