I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, some actions are distributed arbitrarily and it's not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without the need to switch views.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu or any other global menu when selecting text.", "EB": "I expected the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" to be available in the context menu or any other global menu when selecting text.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the editor in the IDE.\n2. Select some text in the editor.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Look for the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" in the context menu. It should not be present.\n5. Switch to the Outline view.\n6. Repeat steps 2-4. The action should now be available in the context menu."}
