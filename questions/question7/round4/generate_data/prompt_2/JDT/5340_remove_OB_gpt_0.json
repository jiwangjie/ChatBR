{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog immediately closes. Eventually, when the exception breakpoint list comes up, it ignores the cancellation request.", "EB": "The progress dialog should remain open when cancel is clicked, and the exception breakpoint list should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. \n2) Click the J! button to add an exception. \n3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
