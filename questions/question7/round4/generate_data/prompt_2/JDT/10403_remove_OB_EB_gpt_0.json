{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "Currently, when creating a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or check to ensure that the output directory (bin) can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "When creating a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation or check to ensure that the output directory (bin) can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  1. Open the project creation process. 2. Select an existing directory structure as the project location. 3. Set the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files. 4. Proceed with creating the project."}
