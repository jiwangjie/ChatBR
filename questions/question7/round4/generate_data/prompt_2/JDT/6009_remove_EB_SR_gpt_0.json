", "OB": "When attempting to create a new class within an existing class, the new class wizard does not correctly identify the context as the parent class. Instead, it treats the nested class as a top-level class.", "EB": "The new class wizard should correctly recognize that the nested class is being created within the parent class and set the appropriate context for the new class.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the IDE \n2. Create a new parent class \n3. Right-click on the parent class and select 'New Class' \n4. In the new class wizard, observe that the context is not set to the parent class \n5. Attempt to create the nested class \n6. Observe that the nested class is treated as a top-level class instead of being recognized as a nested class within the parent class."}
