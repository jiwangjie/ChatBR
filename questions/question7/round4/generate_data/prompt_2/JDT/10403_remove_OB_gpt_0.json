{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project and selects a bin directory as the output folder, the bin directory is not deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "After creating a new project and selecting a bin directory as the output folder, the bin directory should be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the application and navigate to the project creation page. \n2. Choose an existing directory structure for the new project. \n3. Select a bin directory as the output folder. \n4. Complete the project creation process. \n5. Verify that the bin directory is not deleted and rebuilt, but retains its previous content."}
