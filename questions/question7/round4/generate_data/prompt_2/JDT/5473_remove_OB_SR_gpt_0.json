Build 200110251.", "OB": "When executing the ShiftLeft command with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text does not shift as expected.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the text should shift appropriately based on the indentation level, regardless of the presence of tabs or spaces.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open a file with intermixed tabs and spaces as indentation.\n2. Place the cursor on a line with a mix of tabs and spaces.\n3.
