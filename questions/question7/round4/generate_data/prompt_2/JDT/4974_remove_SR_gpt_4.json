Similar to the validation that checks the classpath and output location at once, the setting of classpath / output location should be combined into a single operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved. It should state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "- Open the application\n- Navigate to the settings page\n- Set the output location and classpath separately\n- Press 'Ok'"}
