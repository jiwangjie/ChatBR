At this point, I did not realize that the code assist list was up because I was not looking. There were 2 items in the list: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. I then typed '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I typed '(', the automatic code assist inserted whatever was selected, which was 'DISPOSED'. This behavior is not what I expected.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking.

It should not automatically insert 'DISPOSED' in this case. Additionally, the code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": ""}
