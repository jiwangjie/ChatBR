", "OB": "When replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, and then executing ShiftLeft, the text does not move as expected. It is not clear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab character). However, in the current behavior, it is confusing because there is a stray space and the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
