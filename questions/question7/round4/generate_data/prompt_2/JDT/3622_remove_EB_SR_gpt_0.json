{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a confusing message appears at the top that says \"A folder corresponding to the package name already exists\". This message is displayed even when the package name field is empty, which is unclear and misleading. It needs to be clarified whether this message is an error or a warning, and if it should be displayed in red with an error icon. Additionally, there should not be an error message when the package name field is empty, and the \"Finish\" button should be disabled. Currently, it is not clear how to create a default package since it cannot be created by the user.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard without typing anything in the package name field, the message \"A folder corresponding to the package name already exists\" appears at the top of the wizard.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard without typing anything in the package name field, no message should appear at the top of the wizard.", "SR": "1. Open the New Java Package wizard.\n2. Leave the package name field empty.\n3. Check if the message \"A folder corresponding to the package name already exists\" appears at the top of the wizard.\n4. Verify that the \"Finish\" button is disabled."}
