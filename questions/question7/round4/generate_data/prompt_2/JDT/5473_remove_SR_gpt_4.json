", "OB": "When executing the ShiftLeft command after replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, the text does not shift correctly. It is unclear how the behavior should be specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character to align with the second line. However, currently, even with the stray space, the text does not shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually align the two lines, executing the ShiftLeft command should correctly shift the text.
