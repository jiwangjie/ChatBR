I had to delete it and start again. The code assist feature should recognize that I have typed a '(' and suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, the code assist feature should be case sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "OB": "The code assist feature does not recognize that I have typed a '(' and suggests 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.
