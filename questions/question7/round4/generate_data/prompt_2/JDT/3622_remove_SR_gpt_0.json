{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even when the package name field is empty. It is unclear what this message means and whether it is an error. The bug report also mentions that the finish button should be disabled when the package name field is empty. Additionally, there is a question about how to create a default package as it cannot be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and not entering a package name, a message appears saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and not entering a package name, no message should appear and the finish button should be disabled.
