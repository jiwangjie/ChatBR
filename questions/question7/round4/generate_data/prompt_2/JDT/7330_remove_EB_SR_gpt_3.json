Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste, which is not clear to users. This should be changed. Users should be able to access all actions from the editor, whether they are in the context menu or not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu when selecting text.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the editor. 2. Select some text. 3. Right-click to open the context menu. 4. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is present in the context menu. If not, proceed to step 5. 5. Switch to the Outline view. 6. Right-click to open the context menu. 7. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is now available in the context menu."}
