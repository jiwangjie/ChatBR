{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed arbitrarily and it is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, either through the context menu or through the Edit (or some other global) menu. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu or the Edit menu when selecting text.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the context menu or the Edit menu when selecting text.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Select text in the editor. 2. Right-click to open the context menu or open the Edit menu. Observe if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is listed in any of these menus."}
