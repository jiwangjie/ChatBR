All actions should be reachable from the editor, either in the context menu or via the Edit menu.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is missing from the context menu.", "EB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select some text in the editor and right-click to open the context menu. Confirm that the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not listed. Additionally, try accessing the action via the Edit menu to see if it is available there."}
