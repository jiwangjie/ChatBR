{"id": "4329", "title": "No results found when searching via Package view selection and dialog", "description": "When searching for declarations via the package view selection and dialog, no results are returned. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly. The issue seems to be that the package view initializes the search dialog with the fully qualified name, which is not found during the search. The expected behavior is for the search to first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "When searching for declarations via the package view selection and dialog, no results are returned.", "EB": "The search should return the expected results when searching for declarations via the package view selection and dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1.

Right-click on the package in the package view.\n7. Select the 'Search' option from the context menu.\n8. Search for the same declaration.\n9. Observe that the search returns the expected results."}
