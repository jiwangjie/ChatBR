This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations, and setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation. Similar to the validation process where the classpath and output location are checked together, the setting of classpath and output location should be offered as one operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
