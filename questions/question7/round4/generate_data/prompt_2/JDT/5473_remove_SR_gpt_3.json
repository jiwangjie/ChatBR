It is unclear how the behavior is specified, but in this scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least until the first space character (i.e., the tab should be replaced with spaces). The presence of a stray space makes it even more confusing, as the reason for the text not shifting is unclear.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented visually the same, executing the ShiftLeft command should shift the second line left and the first line left until the first space character. There should be no stray spaces causing confusion about why the text won't shift.", "SR": ""}
