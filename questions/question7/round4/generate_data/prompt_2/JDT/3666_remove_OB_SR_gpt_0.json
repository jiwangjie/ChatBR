Consider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the 'baz' call in 'bar' to make the program correct.", "OB": "The code currently is:\n\nbaz(x.foo());\n\n", "EB": "The code should be changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo());\n\nI would rather it gave me:\n\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo());", "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Create a class 'X' with the following code:\n\npublic class X {\n\tvoid bar(X x) {\n\t\tbaz(x.foo());\n\t}\n\n\tint foo() {\n\t\treturn 5;\n\t}\n\n\tvoid baz(int i, int j) {\n\n\t}\n}\n\n2. Observe that the 'baz' call within the 'bar' method does not have two parameters.\n3. Add a second parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method.\n4. Compile and run the program.\n5. Verify that the program runs as expected and does not produce any errors."}
