Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference. This should be changed so that all actions are easily accessible from the editor.

It is not acceptable to force users to switch views to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
