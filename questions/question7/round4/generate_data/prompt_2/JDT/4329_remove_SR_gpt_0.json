However, when searching via the context menu in the Packages view, the search works correctly. The issue seems to be that the Search dialog initializes with the fully qualified name, which is not found when searching for declarations. The expected behavior is that the Search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are found.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the Search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "1.
