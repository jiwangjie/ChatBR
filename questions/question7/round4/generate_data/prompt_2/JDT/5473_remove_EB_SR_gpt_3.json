However, it is not clear how this behavior is specified. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). In any case, it is confusing if there is a stray space because it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
