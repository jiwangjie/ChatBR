{"id": "6125", "title": "Bug 6125: JAR packager reports open files very late", "description": "When I press 'finish' in the JAR packager, I receive the error message 'JAR creation failed: Unsaved Editors'.", "OB": "The JAR packager does not allow me to create a JAR file if there are unsaved editors. There is no option to save the files before creating the JAR.", "EB": "I expect to be able to create a JAR file even if there are unsaved editors. If there are unsaved editors, a dialog should be displayed asking if I want to save them before creating the JAR.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a file and make changes without saving. 2. Open the JAR packager for the corresponding project. 3. Enter all the required information (path, destination, name, description, etc.) in the JAR packager. 4. Click on 'finish'."}
