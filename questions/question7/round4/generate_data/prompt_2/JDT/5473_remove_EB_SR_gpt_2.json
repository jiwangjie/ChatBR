Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing the ShiftLeft command results in the text movement. In this scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character (removing the tab). However, it is unclear how this behavior is specified. Additionally, if there is a stray space, it is confusing as the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
