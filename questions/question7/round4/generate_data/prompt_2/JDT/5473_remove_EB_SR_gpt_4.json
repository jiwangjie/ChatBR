", "OB": "When the tab character is replaced with spaces in the first line, so that the two lines are visually indented the same, and ShiftLeft is executed, the text moves. However, it is unclear how this behavior is specified. In the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab). In any case, it is confusing if there is a stray space, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the document with intermixed tabs and spaces.\n2.
