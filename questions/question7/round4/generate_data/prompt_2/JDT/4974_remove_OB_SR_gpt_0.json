Additionally, the error message displayed when setting the classpath and output location is strange and should be improved. It should state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "OB": "Not specified", "EB": "The classpath and output location should be set together as one operation. The error message should state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "1. Open the classpath / output location setting window.\n2. Attempt to set the classpath and output location separately.\n3. Observe that the setting is done as two separate operations.\n4. Note the error message displayed and its wording.\n5. Now attempt to set the classpath and output location using the same operation.\n6. Verify that the setting is done as one operation.\n7. Check the error message and confirm that it states that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'."}
