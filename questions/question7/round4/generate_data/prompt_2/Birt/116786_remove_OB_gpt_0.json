{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test and we include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be preserved.", "OB": "The BIRT designer does not generate or save the relative path when including a library in a report design.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design.", "SR": "1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design in $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Verify that the relative path is generated and saved correctly."}
