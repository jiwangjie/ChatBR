{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. However, with the code in CVS from 6/30/05, the schema filter is present, but there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed. Despite the presence of a schema filter, a warning message is displayed during the loading process.", "EB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor should only load tables and columns when they are requested, instead of loading all the schemas and tables on load. This will reduce the initial loading time and eliminate the warning message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor in the SQL Query page.\n2. Note the warning message and the initial loading time due to the tree control population.\n3. Select a specific schema or table and observe if it loads immediately or if there is a delay in the loading process. The expected behavior is that the tables and columns should only load when requested, without any warning messages."}
