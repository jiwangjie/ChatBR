Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. A dialog with the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' appears, where 'Yes' would save the changes, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog is titled 'Error'.", "OB": "When editing XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the changes need to be saved. However, it is not clear to the user how to save or discard the changes, and the error message is not very helpful. The error message is 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "After editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and attempting to switch back to the Layout view, a clear and informative prompt should be displayed to the user, indicating that they need to save or discard their changes. The prompt should clearly state the options 'Yes' for saving changes, 'No' for discarding changes, and 'Cancel' for staying on the Source page. The dialog should be titled 'Save Changes' instead of 'Error'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor. \n2. Switch to the 'source' view in the Layout Editor. \n3. Make changes to the XML. \n4. Try to switch back to the Layout view. \n\nExpected behavior: A prompt should appear, clearly indicating that the changes need to be saved or discarded. The prompt should provide the options 'Yes' for saving changes, 'No' for discarding changes, and 'Cancel' for staying on the Source page. The dialog should be titled 'Save Changes'."}
