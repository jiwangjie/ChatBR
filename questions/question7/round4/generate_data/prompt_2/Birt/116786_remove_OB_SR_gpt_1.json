{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save a relative path. Currently, the absolute path is being stored. This causes issues when the project is moved or shared with other users.\n\nExample:\n1. Create a report design in $project/test.\n2. Include a library in the report design.\n3. Save the report design.\n4. Close and reopen the report design.\n\nCurrently, the absolute path of the library is displayed instead of the relative path.", "OB": "The absolute path of the library is displayed in the report design.", "EB": "The relative path ($project/test/library_name) should be displayed in the report design.", "SR": "1. Create a report design in $project/test.\n2. Include a library in the report design.\n3. Save the report design.\n4. Close and reopen the report design.\n\nExpected result: The library path should be displayed as a relative path ($project/test/library_name) instead of an absolute path."}
