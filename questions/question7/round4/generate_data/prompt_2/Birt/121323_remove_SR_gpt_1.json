{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression includes a selection part (e.g., section[@id='left']), the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. It would be better to use the plain XPath expression (with the path from the data set selector prepended) and allow filtering to be something for those who need it.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the filterInfo data is lost even though the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign.", "EB": "The filterInfo data should be preserved and persisted along with the RelationInformation when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping that includes a selection part (e.g., section[@id='left']).\n3. Fill in any other necessary information.\n4. Leave the dialog and observe that the filterInfo data is lost.\n\nExpected behavior: The filterInfo data should be preserved and persist along with the RelationInformation."}
