Create a new data set without a SQL statement. \n2. Open the data set editor and go to the data source page. \n3. Change the data source to a different one. \n\nActual result: After changing the data source, no children nodes (such as databases, tables, or columns) are listed in the data set editor page of the query tab. \n\nTo workaround the issue, close the data set editor and reopen it."}
