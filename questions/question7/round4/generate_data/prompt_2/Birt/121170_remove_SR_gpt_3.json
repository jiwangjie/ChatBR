{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "The bug report is requesting that the labels returned from the 'get column label' function should be recognizable strings. Currently, the labels returned before extraction are null, while the ones after extraction are user recognizable strings. The expected behavior is that the 'get column label' function should return the same labels before and after extraction, as these labels need to be displayed to the end user before extraction is done.", "OB": "When calling the 'get column label' function before extraction, null labels are returned.", "EB": "The 'get column label' function should return the same user recognizable labels before and after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Call the 'get column label' function before performing any extraction.\n2. Verify that the returned labels are null.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. Call the 'get column label' function before performing any extraction.\n2. Verify that the returned labels are user recognizable strings, identical to the ones obtained after extraction."}
