The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, however, I still have the warning message onload since the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should only load the tables and columns on demand, rather than populating the tree control on load.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Notice that the entire schema is queried, causing a delay in loading.\n3. Eventually, a warning message is displayed stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.\n\nRefer to Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> for the request to add the ability to filter based on schema."}
