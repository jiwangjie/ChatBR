The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query includes a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, the tree is loaded immediately upon opening the page.", "OB": "Currently, when opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query, the tables and columns in the data source tree control are loaded automatically.", "EB": "The loading of tables and columns in the data source tree control should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve performance and allow for a smoother user experience.", "SR": "Steps to Reproduce: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query. \n2. Observe that the tables and columns in the data source tree control are loaded automatically. \n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter. \n4. Observe that the tables and columns are loaded on demand as the user interacts with the tree."}
