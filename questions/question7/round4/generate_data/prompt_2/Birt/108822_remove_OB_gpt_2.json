{"id": "108822", "title": "More effective logic needed for sorting disk when border value is present for row value", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for processing disk sorting with a border value for row value is not efficient.", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is a border value for row value. The program should sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file. Additionally, the file should be copied to the destination folder.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000. 3. Perform the following operations: a) Save the file as a temporary file. b) Load the file into memory. c) Sort the data in memory. d) Save the sorted data to the temporary file."}
