{"id": "108822", "title": "More robust logic is needed to handle sorting of disk data when there are boundary values for row numbers", "description": "When sorting data on disk, if we have 40,000 rows of data and the program is set to process only a subset of that data (less than 40,000), the current logic fails to handle this scenario correctly. Currently, the program performs the following operations:\n1. Saves the file as a temporary file\n2. Loads the file into memory\n3. Performs the sorting operation\n4. Saves the sorted data back to the temporary file\n\nHowever, the expected behavior should be as follows:\n1. Loads the necessary subset of data into memory\n2. Performs the sorting operation on the loaded data\n3. Saves the sorted data back to the temporary file", "OB": "The current logic fails to handle the scenario where the program is set to process less than 40,000 rows of data. It attempts to perform the sorting operation on the entire dataset of 40,000 rows, which is unnecessary and inefficient.", "EB": "The program should only load and sort the subset of data that is required (less than 40,000 rows) instead of processing the entire dataset.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set the program to process less than 40,000 rows of data\n2. Sort the data on disk\n3. Observe that the program loads the entire dataset of 40,000 rows into memory and sorts it, instead of only processing the subset of data that is required"}
