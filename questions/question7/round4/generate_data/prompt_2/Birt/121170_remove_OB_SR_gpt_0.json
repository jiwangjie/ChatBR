This is problematic because the labels need to be displayed to the end user before extraction. The function should return the same labels as after extraction to ensure clarity and consistency.", "OB": "Currently, the getcolumnlabel function returns non-user recognizable strings when called on the meta data object.", "EB": "The getcolumnlabel function should return user recognizable strings when called on the meta data object, to provide clear and consistent labels for display.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Call the getcolumnlabel function on the meta data object.\n2. Observe the returned string.\n\nExpected Result:\nThe getcolumnlabel function should return a user recognizable string that can be displayed to the end user."}
