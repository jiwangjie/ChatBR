{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170: get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "When calling the getcolumnlabel method on the meta data object before extraction, the labels returned are null. However, after the extraction process, the labels become recognizable strings. This is inconsistent behavior and the getcolumnlabel method should return user recognizable strings even before extraction.", "OB": "The labels returned before extraction are null.", "EB": "Bug 121170: getcolumnlabel from meta data object should return user recognizable strings. Since the labels need to be displayed to the end user before doing the extraction, the getcolumnlabel method should return the same labels as after extraction.", "SR": ""}
