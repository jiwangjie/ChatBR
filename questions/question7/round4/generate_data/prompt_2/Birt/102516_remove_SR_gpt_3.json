{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor not loading tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which includes several hundred tables. Even with the schema filter implemented in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, the tree is still being populated on load and causing a warning message. ", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor loads all schemas and tables on page load, even with the schema filter implemented. This results in a warning message being displayed on load. ", "EB": "The load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will prevent the warning message from being displayed on load. ", "SR": ""}
