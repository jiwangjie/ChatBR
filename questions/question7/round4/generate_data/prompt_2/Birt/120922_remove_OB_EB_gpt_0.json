{"id": "120922", "title": "Dirty Page behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor in the XML Report Designer, and then switching back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed. The message says 'Source page is dirty' and prompts the user to save their changes. The user is presented with three options: Yes (to save the changes), No (to discard the changes), and Cancel (to remain on the Source page without saving). The error message dialog is titled 'Error'. However, the wording of the dialog and the options can be confusing for the user, as they need to figure out how to save or discard their changes. This behavior needs to be improved.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the source view of the Layout Editor and switching back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the Source page is dirty.", "EB": "When editing the XML in the source view of the Layout Editor and switching back to the Layout view, a clear error message should be displayed prompting the user to save their changes.
