Currently, when editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then trying to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the changes need to be saved. The error message is not clear and the user is left unsure of what to do next. The dialog is incorrectly titled 'Error' with quotes. The dialog should use a better title and the quotes should be removed.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then trying to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed. However, the error message is not clear and does not provide clear instructions on how to save the changes.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be for the error message to inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed and provide clear options to save or discard the changes. Additionally, the dialog should use an appropriate title without the quotes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor.\n3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n\nExpected result: An error message should inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed and provide clear options to save or discard the changes."}
