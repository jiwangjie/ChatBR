{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior of treating XPath expressions in this way can potentially cause a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist when leaving the dialog and should not be lost.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' for the column mapping.\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Check if the filter information entered is still present in the filterInfo HashMap after leaving the dialog and persists when opening the dialog again."}
