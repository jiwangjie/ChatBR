{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema, which can be several hundred tables. Even though there is a schema filter in the code from 6/30/05, there is still a warning message when the page is loaded because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed. This causes a warning message to appear when the page is loaded because the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will prevent the warning message and improve the loading performance.", "SR": ""}
