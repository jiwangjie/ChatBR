{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. With the code from CVS from 6/30/05, although there is a schema filter, the warning message is still displayed on load because the tree is being populated at that time.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers and the code from CVS from 6/30/05, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a while to load. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor. \n2. Wait for the entire schema to be queried and the warning message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' to be displayed. \n\nPlease note that Bug 101372 asked for the ability to filter based on schema."}
