When leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way could lead to trouble.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist filter information. When leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be retained.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like `section[@id='left']`.\n3. Note that within class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Verify that the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information. When leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be retained."}
