{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait. After some time, a message appears saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. This bug report is requesting the ability to load tables and columns on demand and the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the user has to wait while the entire schema is queried. A 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message appears after some time.", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, the tables and columns should load on demand. The user should not have to wait while the entire schema is queried. There should be no message limiting the number of items in the available list.", "SR": "Open the data set editor and observe that the entire schema is queried, causing a delay. Eventually, a message appears limiting the number of items to 500. This behavior should be changed to load tables and columns on demand. Additionally, the ability to filter based on schema should be implemented."}
