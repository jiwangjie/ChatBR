{"id": "116744", "title": "Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "When using a dynamic text element to display the contents of a database field with three types of content (HTML text within <html ...</html> tag, HTML fragments not within <html> tag, and text with RTF tags), the expected behavior is that the dynamic text element renders the content based on its content type. However, the observed behavior is that the dynamic text element does not apply the appropriate rendering based on the content type.", "OB": "The dynamic text element does not apply any rendering to the content, regardless of its content type.", "EB": "The dynamic text element should render the content based on its content type. HTML text within <html ...</html> tag should be rendered as formatted HTML, HTML fragments not within <html> tag should be rendered as plain text, and text with RTF tags should be rendered with the appropriate RTF formatting.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Create a database field with three types of content: a) HTML text within <html ...</html> tag b) HTML fragments not within <html> tag c) Text with RTF tags 2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field. 3. Verify that the dynamic text element does not apply the appropriate rendering based on the content type."}
