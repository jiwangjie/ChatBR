The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Even though the schema filter is present in the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the warning message still appears upon page load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being shown.
