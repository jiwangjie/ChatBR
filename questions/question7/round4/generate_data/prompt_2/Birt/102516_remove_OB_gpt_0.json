The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and a message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe that the entire schema is queried and the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed. Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> provides more details about filtering based on schema."}
