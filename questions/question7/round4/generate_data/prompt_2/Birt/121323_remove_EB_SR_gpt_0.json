{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] is entered for the column mapping, the selection part is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap in the class RelationInformation. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. This handling of XPath expressions can potentially cause a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog and saving the changes, the filter information is not persisted. The data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost when leaving the dialog and the filter is not applied to the resulting .rptdesign.", "EB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog and saving the changes, the filter information should be persisted. The data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should not be lost when leaving the dialog, and the filter should be correctly applied to the resulting .rptdesign.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] for a column mapping.\n3. Save the changes and close the dialog.\n4. Open the .rptdesign file.\n5. Verify that the filter information is not persisted and the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
