{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "The current behavior observed is that the report design stores an absolute path for the included library. However, we need to save the relative path instead.", "OB": "Upon inspection, it is noticed that the report design has an absolute path for the included library: <property name=\"fileName\"/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Navigate to the project directory ($project/test) containing the report design.\n2. Include a library from the otherlib folder using relative path ($project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary)."}
