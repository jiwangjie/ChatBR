The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. Currently, when using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, there is a schema filter, but there is still a warning message upon loading the page because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema on the system, leading to a long list of tables. Upon loading the page, there is a warning message.", "EB": "The load of the tree view should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
