{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information when an XPath expression is entered for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'. In the class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior may lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog after entering an XPath expression for the column mapping that includes a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the filter information stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should properly persist the filter information stored in the filterInfo HashMap, even when an XPath expression with a selection part is entered for the column mapping.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping that includes a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'. \n 3. Configure any other settings if needed. \n 4. Leave the dialog. \n\n Expected Result: The filter information should be persisted and not lost."}
