{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When inspecting the report design, it is observed that the file path of the included library is stored as an absolute path instead of a relative path. For example, <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when a library is included in a report design. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, the file path should be stored as <property name='fileName' value='../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design that includes a library.\n3. Inspect the included library's file path in the report design.\n\nExpected result:\nThe file path of the included library should be stored as a relative path, considering the location of the report design."}
