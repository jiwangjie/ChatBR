Sort a dataset with 40000 rows on disk \n2. Configure the program to process only a subset of the data (less than 40000 rows) \n3. The program should: \n   a. Save the data as a temporary file \n   b. Load the temporary file into memory \n   c. Perform the sorting operation on the loaded data \n   d. Save the sorted data back to the temporary file "}
