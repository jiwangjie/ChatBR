{"id": "120216", "title": "Bug 120216: Group dialog not shown when dataset is not set", "description": "In our current implementation, we are not able to create groupings in a table if the dataset is not set. However, as part of the template requirements, the UI should still allow the user to create groups even when the dataset is not set. Currently, an error is shown when attempting to create a group without setting the dataset. This behavior needs to be fixed.", "OB": "Currently, when a table report item is added and the dataset is not set, an error is shown when attempting to create a new table group.", "EB": "The group dialog should be shown to the user even when the dataset is not set. The user should be able to create groups without any errors.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, add a table report item but do not set the dataset. Then, try creating a new table group and observe that the group dialog is not shown and an error is displayed instead."}
