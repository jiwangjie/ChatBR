Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. When prompted to save changes, selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page. In addition, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out how to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder). Also, the error message is not very clear. The error message currently states 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog with the title 'XML Report Design Has Been Changed'. The dialog should not have any quotes in the title.", "SR": ""}
