{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using Find/Replace in the text editor, the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "When using Find/Replace in the text editor, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. It should allow for a full range of find and replace operations to be performed. It should also respect the case of what the user types. ", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open a document in the text editor. \n2. Make sure the Edit > Find/Replace... option is available. \n3. Type any text in the Find field. \n4. Observe that the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history.\n\nThis behavior is similar for the Replace With field."}
