This issue is not caught by the eclipse compiler or Sun's compiler.", "EB": "The usage of Class.forName() method in the BidiUtil class should be removed to avoid the NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Verify or use jxeLink or similar methods to execute the code in the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class.\n3. Observe that a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown due to the usage of Class.forName() method.\n\nExpected behavior: The code should execute without any NoClassDefFoundError when using the CLDC version of SWT."}
