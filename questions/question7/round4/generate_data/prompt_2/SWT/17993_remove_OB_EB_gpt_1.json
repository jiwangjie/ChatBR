{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature is to replace what is typed with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the search automatically suggests entries from previous searches.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the application and choose 'Edit' > 'Find/Replace...'.\n2. In the 'Find' field, type 'a' and click 'Find'.\n3. Try to type 'A' in the 'Find' field again."}
