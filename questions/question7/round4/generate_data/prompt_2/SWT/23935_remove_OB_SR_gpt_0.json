{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "In the current build, running the attached code, the left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux.", "EB": "In build 20020920, running the attached code, the left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux, but the right tree and text do not lose focus on Windows. The right tree and text should lose focus when clicking or interacting with any other element on the window.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the attached code in the build 20020920.\n2. Click on the right tree or interact with the right text.\n3. Observe that the right tree and text do not lose focus as expected."}
