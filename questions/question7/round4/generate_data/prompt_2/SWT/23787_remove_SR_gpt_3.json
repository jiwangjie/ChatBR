Integration build 09/17. The text fields in the Project Properties Info page look bad on all Motif platforms. On Windows, they look fine. On Motif platforms, these text fields have automatic borders which make them appear as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which worsen their visibility. The text fields should be replaced with readonly Text fields to avoid these issues. This would also allow users to select and copy their values, if necessary.", "OB": "On Motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders and on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, they have differently colored backgrounds, making them stand out and look bad.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should be replaced with readonly Text fields.
