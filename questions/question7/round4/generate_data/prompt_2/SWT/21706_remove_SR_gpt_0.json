Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it would be a good practice to prevent people from instantiating the class unnecessarily. Adding a private constructor does not increase the size of the class, as the compiler generates a free public constructor by default.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, verify or use jxeLink or a similar tool. Observe that the method using Class.forName() throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries."}
