On the integration build 09/17, the text fields on the Project Properties Info page appear distorted on all Motif platforms. On Windows, it appears fine. However, on Motif platforms, these text fields have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On Motif platforms, the text fields on the Project Properties Info page appear distorted, with automatic borders indicating them as user input targets.
