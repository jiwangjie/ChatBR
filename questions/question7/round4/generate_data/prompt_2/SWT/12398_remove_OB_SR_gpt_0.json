{"id": "12398", "title": "Bug 12398: Accessibility problems", "description": "When using the application, I need to first click on one of the \"live\" areas (such as the banner with the tool buttons, the navigation frame, or the content frame) before it starts working properly. This means that the Help view is not starting in a way that can be immediately navigated via the keyboard.", "OB": "When accessing the Help view, it does not respond to keyboard navigation. Clicking on the \"live\" areas is required for the view to become functional.", "EB": "The Help view should start in a way that allows immediate keyboard navigation, without the need to click on any specific area.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch the application. 2. Access the Help view. 3. Attempt to navigate using the keyboard. Observe that keyboard navigation does not work until clicking on one of the \"live\" areas."}
