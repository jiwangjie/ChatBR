{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is significantly slower than close and reopen in Java editor", "description": "When working in the Java editor, I noticed that the 'Revert' functionality is much slower compared to closing and reopening the file. To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Make changes to a Java file.\n2. Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n3. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter performing steps 1 and 2, if I then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nI would expect the 'Revert' operation to be as fast as closing and reopening the file, since it is essentially restoring the original file contents.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Make changes to a Java file.\n2. Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n3. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n4. Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor."}
