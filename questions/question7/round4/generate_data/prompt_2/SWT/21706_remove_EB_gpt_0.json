{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "When using org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil in the win32 version, there is a line of code that uses Class.forName() which causes a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. The problem is that the method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. To resolve this issue, the line of code that uses Class.forName() should be changed.", "OB": "When using org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil in the win32 version of SWT, if the CLDC version is verified or used with jxeLink, a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown. This error is not defined in the CLDC class libraries.", "EB": "", "SR": "To fix this issue, change the line 'static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);' to 'static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);'. This change should have the same effect as the original line of code."}
