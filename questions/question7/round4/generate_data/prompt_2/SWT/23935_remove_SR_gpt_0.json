{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "Build 20020920: Run the attached code. The left tree and text behave as they should on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "1. Open the attached code in Build 20020920.\n2. Observe the behavior when clicking anywhere in the tree.\n3. Compare the behavior on Windows and Linux.\n4. Note the behavior of the text widget when clicking on the tree.\n5. Note the child relationship between the text widget and the tree.\n6. Verify if platform UI bug 2470 is related to this issue."}
