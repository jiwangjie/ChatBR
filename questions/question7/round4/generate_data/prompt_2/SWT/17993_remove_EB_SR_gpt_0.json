{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialogue in the F1 build has a history feature for recent searches. However, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a matching entry from the history is found, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, but it can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered.", "OB": "In the Find/Replace dialogue accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace..., when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a matching entry is found in the history, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "The typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields should not be replaced with a value from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the F1 build\n2. Access the Find/Replace dialogue through Edit -> Find/Replace...\n3. Type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields\n4. Ensure that there are some recent entries in the search history\n5. Observe that when typing, the typed entry is replaced with a matching value from the history\n6. It should be possible to perform find or replace operations without the typed entry being automatically replaced with a value from the history"}
