{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree does not lose focus.", "EB": "In build 20020920, when the attached code is run, the left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, click anywhere in the tree to check if the tree loses focus."}
