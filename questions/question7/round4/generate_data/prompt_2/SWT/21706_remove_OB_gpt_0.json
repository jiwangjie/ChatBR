Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, making the constructor private will prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class. This change will not increase the size of the class. The new constructor should be private instead of public.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, change the line above to:static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);\n(Note: This code change has not been tested, but it is expected to produce the same result as the original code.)"}
