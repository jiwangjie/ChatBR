Looks bad on all motif platforms. ", "OB": "On Windows, the Project Properties Info page looks fine. However, on motif platforms, such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, the text fields in the Info page have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields in the Info page should be created as readonly Text fields instead of Labels. It seems that these fields are currently text fields so that their values can be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": ""}
