Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields should be replaced with read-only labels. This change will prevent the automatic borders from appearing and improve the visual consistency. It is possible that the text fields were initially used so that users can select and copy their values.", "SR": ""}
