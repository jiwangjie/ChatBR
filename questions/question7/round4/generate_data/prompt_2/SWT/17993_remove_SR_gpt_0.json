{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace dialog is that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior is problematic as it makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. The search of the history is also case-insensitive, which means that the case of what is typed may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. It would be better if the Find/Replace feature allowed the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I suggest either changing the behavior to something simpler that doesn't replace the typed entry or removing the feature altogether.", "OB": "When using the F1 build, I noticed that in the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit->Find/Replace...), typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields triggers a search for entries from a previous search. If a matching entry is found in the history, what I have typed gets replaced with the value from the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields should not be replaced with a value from the history. The behavior should respect the case of what the user types. This change would allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open a document in the application.\n2. Access the Find/Replace dialog through Edit->Find/Replace...\n3. Try typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.\nExpected behavior: The typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. The search of the history should respect the case of what the user types.\nActual behavior: The typed entry gets replaced with a value from the history, and the search of the history is case-insensitive."}
