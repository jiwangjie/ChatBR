The Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog should not use text fields. This issue is specific to the motif platform. On motif, the text fields have automatic borders, which make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which further highlight them.", "OB": "On motif, the Project Properties Info page displays text fields that have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets. On Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them more prominent.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. Instead, it should use a different UI element that does not have automatic borders or different colored backgrounds.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Select a Project. 2. Right-click and select Properties. 3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (values for Path, Type, etc.) that are displayed as text fields."}
