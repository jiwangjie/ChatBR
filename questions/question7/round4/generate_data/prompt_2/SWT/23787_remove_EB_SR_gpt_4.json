When viewing the Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog, it appears that text fields are being used. This issue is observed in the integration build from 09/17. On motif platforms, such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, the text fields have automatic borders applied to them, making them appear as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, the text fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more.", "OB": "On Windows, the Project Properties Info page appears fine.
