{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous search entry is found in the history, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, resulting in the case of the typed entry being changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields in the Find/Replace dialog, if a previous search entry is found in the history, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. The case of the typed entry is changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields in the Find/Replace dialog, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. The case of the typed entry should remain unchanged.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by choosing Edit -> Find/Replace...\n2. Note the history of recent searches.\n3. Type 'a' into the Find field and click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the Find field, but observe that it is automatically replaced with the case of the value from the history."}
