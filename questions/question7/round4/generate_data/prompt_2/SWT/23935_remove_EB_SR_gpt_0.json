{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This behavior is causing platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when you click anywhere in the tree, the text widget should lose focus. This should happen regardless of the operating system being used.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the application on Linux.\n2. Open a window containing a tree widget and a text widget as children of the shell.\n3. Click anywhere in the tree widget.\n4. Observe that the text widget does not lose focus.\n\nExpected result: The text widget should lose focus when clicking on the tree widget."}
