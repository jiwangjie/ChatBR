As there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it is unnecessary to allow instantiation. Adding a private constructor would prevent people from inadvertently creating instances. This change would not increase the size of the class, as the compiler automatically generates a public constructor. Instead, it would make the constructor private and prevent unnecessary instantiation.", "SR": "1. Locate the BidiUtil class in the win32 module.\n2. Verify that the class currently has a public constructor.\n3. Add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class.\n4. Build and test the project to ensure the changes are integrated properly."}
