{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replacing typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of Find/Replace is inconsistent with user expectations. When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the entered text is replaced with a value from the search history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in web browsers, but it should not apply in this context. It would be better to have a full autocomplete feature in the future, but until then, the current behavior should be changed to allow for a wider range of find and replace operations while still respecting the case of the user's input. To reproduce the issue, follow the steps below:", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the entered text is replaced with a value from the search history.", "EB": "The 'Find/Replace' feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Users should be able to type freely in both fields without any interference from the search history. ", "SR": "1. Open a document to make the 'Edit' > 'Find/Replace...' option available.\n2. In the Find field, enter any text (e.g., 'hello').\n3. Click the 'Find' button.\n4. Try to type different text (e.g., 'Hello') into the Find field.\n5. Observe that the entered text is replaced with the value from the search history.\n\nAdditionally, try performing a 'Replace' operation with different text in the 'Replace With' field and observe the same behavior."}
