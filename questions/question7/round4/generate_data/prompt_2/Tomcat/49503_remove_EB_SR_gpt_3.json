{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (such as 80). This issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 and bug 48625. The expected behavior is for the second instance to fail, as it does not bind to the port. However, the exception does not occur because the connector only tries to bind when the start() method is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await(). This issue occurs in the trunk at revision 957942 and may affect 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This separate phase is implemented through separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() methods. This issue breaks the fix for bug 48625.", "OB": "The Connector does not bind to the port when the Catalina.load() method is called.", "EB": "The Connector should bind to the port when the Catalina.load() method is called.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully.\n2. Start the second instance of Tomcat.\n3. Observe that the Connector does not bind to the port and the startup sequence continues.\n4. Eventually, the startup fails in Server.await()."}
