{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name affecting URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299 is related to chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, which states that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the sessionid is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the observed behavior shows that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nbut the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid':\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "Expected behavior is that if the configuration in 7.1.1 is followed, the Reload link should be:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F.", "SR": ""}
