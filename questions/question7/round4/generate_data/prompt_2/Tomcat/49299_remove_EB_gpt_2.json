However, when testing with the provided cookiename.war, the actual behavior is different. The page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses the default 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "Expected behavior: If a custom name is configured for session tracking cookies, it should also be used as the name of the URI parameter if URL rewriting is enabled.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Deploy the attached cookiename.war file. 2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/."}
