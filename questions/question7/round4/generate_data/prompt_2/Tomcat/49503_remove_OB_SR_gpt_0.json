{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503 Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Bug 49503 Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstart.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. \n To reproduce: \n 1. The first instance starts successfully. \n", "OB": "Upon starting Tomcat, the Connectors do not bind to their ports in the StandardService.initInternal() method.", "EB": "I would expect that in the StandardService.initInternal() method, when the connector.init() call is made, it fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n 1. Start Tomcat and observe that the Connectors do not bind to their ports in the StandardService.initInternal() method."}
