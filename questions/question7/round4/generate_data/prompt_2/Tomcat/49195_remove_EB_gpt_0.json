Server not shut down.` However, this message does not affect the functionality of Tomcat, as it still shuts down properly. It is worth noting that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, `Catalina.server` is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat prints the following error message in the `catalina.20100427.log` file: `27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured.
