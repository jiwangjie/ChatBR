{"id": "49195", "title": "Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, Tomcat works as expected but prints an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message is: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat actually stops after printing the message. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, CatalinaServer is not null.", "OB": "The following is printed in the catalina.20100427.log:\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nIt is just a message. Tomcat stops regardless of it: After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use 'wait(10000)' instead of 'sleep(10000)' in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a 'notifyAll()' call, or use 'interrupt()' call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": ""}
