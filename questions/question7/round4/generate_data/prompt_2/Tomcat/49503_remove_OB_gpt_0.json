{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503 - Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap load(String[]) and Bootstart start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "The observed behavior is not provided.", "EB": "Expected behavior:\nI would expect that in StandardService.initInternal() the connector.init() call fails, because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() is caught there and, if EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in Catalina.load() and then rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
