Improvements can be made to how Tomcat is stopped. System.exit(0) should work regardless of the server port specified. It is also suggested to check if jsvc shows the same behavior.", "OB": "When stopping the Tomcat service with shutdown port 1 on Windows, an error message is printed.", "EB": "It would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await() so that it can be woken up by a notifyAll() call. Alternatively, the interrupt() method can be used to wake up the thread if it's known.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example by calling Catalina.stop()."}
