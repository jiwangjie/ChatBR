{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Custom cookie name not affecting URL rewriting", "description": "Chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf states that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled). However, when testing with the provided cookieName.war, the actual behavior is different. Cookie is correctly set with the custom name, but the URL generated by the 'Reload' link on the page is still using 'jsessionid' followed by the session ID.", "OB": "When accessing the page using the provided cookieName.war, the session tracking cookie is set with the custom name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE'. However, when clicking on the 'Reload' link on the page, the URL generated contains 'jsessionid' followed by the session ID.", "EB": "When accessing the page using the provided cookieName.war, the session tracking cookie should be set with the custom name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE'. When clicking on the 'Reload' link on the page, the URL generated should use the custom cookie name followed by the session ID.", "SR": "1. Deploy the provided cookieName.war to a Servlet 3.0-compatible server.\n2. Access the application using a web browser.\n3. Verify that the session tracking cookie is set with the custom name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE'.\n4. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page.\n5. Observe that the URL generated uses 'jsessionid' followed by the session ID instead of the custom cookie name."}
