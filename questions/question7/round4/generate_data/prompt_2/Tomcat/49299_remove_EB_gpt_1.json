{"id": "49299", "title": "Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 incorrectly states that custom cookie name affects URL rewriting", "description": "The bug report mentions that in chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled). However, the actual behavior is different and the default 'jsessionid' is used instead. The bug report includes an attachment 'cookiename.war' that demonstrates this issue.", "OB": "When accessing the page, the following cookie is sent: SetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. However, the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid': http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1.
