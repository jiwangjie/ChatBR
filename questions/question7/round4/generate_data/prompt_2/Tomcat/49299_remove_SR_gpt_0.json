{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL, provided that URL rewriting has been enabled. However, the actual result is that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the Reload link on the page still uses 'jsessionid' as the parameter name.", "OB": "On the page, the following cookie is sent:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nBut the Reload link URL includes 'jsessionid' instead of the configured cookie name:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4", "EB": "Expected result: If the phrase in 7.1.1 is to be followed, I would expect the Reload link to be:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": ""}
