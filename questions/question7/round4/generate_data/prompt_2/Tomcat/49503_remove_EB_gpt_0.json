{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this issue supposedly affects Tomcat 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, which allows Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is achieved through separate Bootstrap load(String[]) and Boot start() methods [1]. However, this implementation breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When starting the second instance of Tomcat, it fails in an unexpected way. The exception does not occur and the connector does not try to bind to the port. The startup sequence continues and eventually fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connector should bind to its port during the Catalina.load() phase, rather than waiting until start() is called.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true. 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
