The error message is as follows:\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\nDespite printing the error message, Tomcat still shuts down properly. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() method executes System.exit(1), resulting in Tomcat shutting down. It appears that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server object is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
