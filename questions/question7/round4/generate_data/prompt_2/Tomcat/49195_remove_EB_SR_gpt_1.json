However, Tomcat still shuts down successfully. The error message does not affect the functionality of Tomcat. It is possible that jsvc may exhibit similar behavior, but I have not tested it.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with Windows service, the following error message is printed in catalina.20100427.log: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nDespite this error message, Tomcat stops successfully. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() method calls System.exit(1), resulting in the shutdown of Tomcat. It is worth noting that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
