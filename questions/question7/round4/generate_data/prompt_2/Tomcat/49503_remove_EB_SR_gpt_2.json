{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503 Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When running Tomcat with jsvc, the connectors fail to bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() phase, but only bind when the start() method is called. This issue is observed with trunk at revision 957942, and it is expected to affect version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase where Connectors can bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented with separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() methods [1]. However, this implementation breaks the fix for bug 48625. The issue can be reproduced as follows: 1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "When starting the second instance, it fails in an unexpected way. The exception that is expected to occur does not happen because the connector does not attempt to bind to the port. The startup sequence continues and then fails in the Server.await() method.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
