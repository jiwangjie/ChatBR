{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this issue supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate pre-startup phase when starting Tomcat, which allows Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate `Bootstrap.load(String[])` and `Bootstrap.start()` methods [1]. However, with this approach, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Start the first instance successfully.\n\n[OB]\n\n[EB]\n\n[SR]", "OB": "The observed behavior is not provided.", "EB": "Connectors should bind to their ports in the `Catalina.load()` method, rather than starting the binding process in the `start()` method.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Add the following line to `conf/catalina.properties`:\n   `org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true`\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
