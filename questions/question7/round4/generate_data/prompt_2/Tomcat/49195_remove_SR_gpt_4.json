{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, a error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer \nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nHowever, despite the error message, Tomcat stops successfully. After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "If the service launcher stops Tomcat and Catalina server is not null, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(). This would allow it to be woken by a notifyAll() call or by using the interrupt() call to wake up the thread, if we know which thread to interrupt.", "SR": ""}
