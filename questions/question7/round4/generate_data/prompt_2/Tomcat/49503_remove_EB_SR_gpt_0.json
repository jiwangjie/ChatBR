{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in start() method", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. It is implemented by having separate `Bootstrap.load(String[])` and `Bootstrap.start()` methods [1]. Downgrading user observes this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that was applied in r957960.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is not able to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80). The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Start Tomcat with jsvc on a port that requires privileged access (e.g., port 80). 2. Observe that the connector does not try to bind to the port immediately. 3. Call the `start()` method to bind the connector to the port. 4. Confirm that the startup sequence continues and then fails in `Server.await()`."}
