When targeting .class files from injars, the source path is currently shown in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. This issue can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. Note that the tests may return false positives as filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. It has been observed in AJDT that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted from the declare warning message.", "OB": "In the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the incorrect form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes, the filenames may not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "In the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the correct form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": ""}
