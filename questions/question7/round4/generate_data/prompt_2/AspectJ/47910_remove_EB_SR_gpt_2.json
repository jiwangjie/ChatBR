{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc to create a jar file using the outjar option, the resulting jar file is missing the MANIFEST.MF file, even though I have a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file present. The ajc documentation mentions that the outjar option is used to put the output classes in a zip file, which implies that it should include a MANIFEST.MF file. However, when I use the outjar option, the resulting file is not a valid jar file due to the missing MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I call ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, an output file is created with a .jar extension. However, the resulting file does not contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The jar file created using the ajc outjar option should include the appropriate MANIFEST.MF file, taken from the METAINF/MANIFEST.MFfile present in the project.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run the command ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar\n2. Check the resulting jar file for the presence of a valid MANIFEST.MF file."}
