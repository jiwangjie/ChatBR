The source code to reproduce the problem can be found in tests/new/binaryWarnings/. However, it should be noted that these tests may produce false positives as filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. This issue was observed in AJDT, where the source path is omitted if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages is displayed as 'app.Main.class' when targeting .class files within injars.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to display the source path in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class' in declare warning messages when targeting .class files within injars.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the code from tests/new/binaryWarnings/\n2. Run the code and check the declare warning messages for the incorrect source path format."}
