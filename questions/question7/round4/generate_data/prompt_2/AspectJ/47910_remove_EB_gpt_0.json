{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The ajc command with the 'outjar' parameter is not including the necessary MANIFEST.MF file in the created jar file. The ajc documentation suggests that the 'outjar' parameter should create a zip file, but it does not make sense to have a parameter called 'outjar' for creating a zip file.", "OB": "When I call ajc command with the 'sourceroots' parameter, followed by 'outjar' parameter specifying the output file name as <my.jar>, a jar file is created. However, this jar file does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file, making it an invalid jar file.", "EB": "The 'outjar' parameter should include the MANIFEST.MF file in the created jar file. This will result in a valid jar file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the ajc command with the 'sourceroots' parameter specifying the source directory.\n2. Add the 'outjar' parameter followed by the desired output file name as <my.jar>.\n3. Verify that the created jar file contains the MANIFEST.MF file."}
