See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the problem. Note that these tests may generate false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. AJDT may omit the filename if it makes no sense to AJDT.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. I have also observed cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that issue.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
