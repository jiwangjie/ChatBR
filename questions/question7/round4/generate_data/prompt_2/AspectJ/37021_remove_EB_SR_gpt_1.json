When targeting .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Additionally, there are cases where the filenames do not appear in the declare warning messages. The problem can be reproduced by running the code provided in the directory 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'. Note that these tests may give false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. It is observed that AJDT may omit the filename if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'.
