{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131 - ajc does not create the appropriate output directory when compiling classes from a subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- A directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory instead of the parent directory.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- The output directory should be created in the parent directory without creating a nested subdirectory.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create the class in the subpackage\n2. Compile the class using ajc\n3. Observe the creation of a nested subdirectory under the existing subpackage directory\n\n"}
