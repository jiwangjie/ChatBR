When using .class files from injars, the sourcepath is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. In some cases, the filenames may not appear at all in the declare warning messages. These issues can be observed by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. Please note that the tests may produce false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. I have also seen instances where the filenames do not appear at all, but these occurrences are not replicated in the provided tests.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
