This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc -d subpackage subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObservation: A directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nExpected Behavior: It would be nice to have the same behavior as javac.\n\nSteps to Reproduce: Use the -d option while correctly compiling classes from the subpackage.", "OB": "A directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory when using ajc command to compile classes from the subpackage.", "EB": "It would be nice to have the same behavior as javac when compiling classes from the subpackage.", "SR": "Use the -d option while correctly compiling classes from the subpackage."}
