The issue can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. folder. However, please note that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it seems that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is incorrectly displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that the filenames may not appear at all, although this issue is not reproduced by the provided tests.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
