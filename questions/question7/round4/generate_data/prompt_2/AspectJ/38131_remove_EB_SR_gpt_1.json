{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option. I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n         System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n      }\n   }\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter executing the above command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. The compiled class file (Test.class) is placed inside the \"subpackage\\subpackage\" directory.\n\nRunning the java command results in the following exception:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe compiled Test.class file should be put directly in the \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nSuggested Resolution:\nAdding the \"-d .\" option to the ajc command resolves the issue.\n\nSteps to reproduce (updated):\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n         System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n      }\n   }\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java"}
