However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "When the outjar parameter is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file that contains a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>'. Verify that the resulting <my.jar> file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
