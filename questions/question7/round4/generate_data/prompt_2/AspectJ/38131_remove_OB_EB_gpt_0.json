{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d option to compile classes from subpackages correctly", "description": "I am using version 1.1rc1 of ajc. This bug is a regression since rc1 and is different from javac. I suspect it may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n         System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n      }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nOBSERVED BEHAVIOR:\nAfter compiling, you will see a subdirectory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR:\nThe compiled class should be placed in the correct subpackage directory without creating a redundant subdirectory.\n\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\n1. Create the class in a subpackage\n2. Compile the class using the 'ajc' command provided above"}
