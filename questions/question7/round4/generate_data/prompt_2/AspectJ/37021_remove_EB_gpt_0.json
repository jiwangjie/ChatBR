When targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. I have also observed cases where the filenames do not appear at all in the declare warning messages. The problem can be reproduced by running the code provided in tests/new/binaryWarnings/. It is important to note that these tests can sometimes yield false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. This issue was initially noticed in AJDT, where the filename is sometimes omitted if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'.

Also, confirm that the filenames are displayed correctly in the declare warning messages."}
