{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When using declare warning messages to target .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also instances where the filenames do not appear at all.", "OB": "In the declare warning messages, the source path for binary files is incorrect. It is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames are not displayed at all. However, these tests do not reproduce that specific problem.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the declare warning messages should display the correct source path for binary files as 'app/Main'. Additionally, the filenames should be consistently displayed in the warning messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow the steps below:\n1. Use the provided code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Trigger the error and verify the declare warning message\n3. Observe that the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'"}
