To replicate the issue, please run the code provided in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. folder. It should be noted that these tests may produce false positives as filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, the filenames sometimes do not appear if they make no sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that specific problem.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars should be listed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": ""}
