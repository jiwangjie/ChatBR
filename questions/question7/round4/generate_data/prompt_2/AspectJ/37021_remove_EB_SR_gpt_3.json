{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path is incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When declaring warnings on binary files in Java or AspectJ, the source path is displaying incorrectly. The expected format should be 'app/Main' but it is currently displayed as 'app.Main.class'. To reproduce this issue, please refer to the code in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'. It is important to note that these tests may produce false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. It has been noted in AJDT that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it may be omitted entirely.", "OB": "In declare warning messages for .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that in some cases the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that particular problem.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
