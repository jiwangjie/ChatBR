This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with the change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved behavior:\n   A directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nExpected behavior:\n   The class is compiled without creating an additional \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nNote: This behavior is different from javac.\n\nSuggested resolution:\n   Implement the same behavior as javac by not creating an additional \"subpackage\" directory during compilation.\n\n", "OB": "A directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "The class is compiled without creating an additional \"subpackage\" directory.", "SR": "1.
