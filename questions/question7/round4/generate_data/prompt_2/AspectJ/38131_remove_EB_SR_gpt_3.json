{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option. I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\n   Note: This assumes that you are currently in the parent directory of 'subpackage'.\n\n3. After compilation, you will see a directory named 'subpackage' created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\n4. Running the java command on the compiled class results in the following error:\n\n   Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\n5. Running either of the following commands fixes the problem:\n\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\n   javac subpackage\\Test.java\n\nNo big deal, really.", "OB": "The compiled Test.class file is put into the 'subpackage\\subpackage' directory. This means that running the java command without specifying the correct classpath results in a 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError' for the subpackage.Test class.", "EB": "The compiled Test.class file should be put into the 'subpackage' directory, not the 'subpackage\\subpackage' directory. Running the java command without specifying the correct classpath should not result in a 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError' for the subpackage.Test class.", "SR": "1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile the class using 'ajc' command without the -d option.\n3. Verify that the compiled Test.class file is put into the 'subpackage\\subpackage' directory.\n4. Try to run the java command on the compiled Test.class file and observe the 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError'.\n5. Re-compile the class using either 'ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java' or 'javac subpackage\\Test.java'.\n6. Verify that the compiled Test.class file is put into the 'subpackage' directory.\n7. Try to run the java command on the re-compiled Test.class file and observe that it executes without any errors."}
