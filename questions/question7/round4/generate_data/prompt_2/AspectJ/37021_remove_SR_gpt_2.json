The problem can be observed by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/. However, please note that these tests may return false positives due to limitations in filename checking. In AJDT, if the filename does not make sense, it may be omitted.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the source path in declare warning messages is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be displayed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": ""}
