See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the source path in the declare warning messages is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\". Additionally, in some cases, the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "In the declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form \"app/Main\" instead of \"app.Main.class\".", "SR": ""}
