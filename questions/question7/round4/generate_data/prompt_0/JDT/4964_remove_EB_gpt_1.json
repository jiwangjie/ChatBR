{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED intWidgetdispose() voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(' then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "", "SR": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, follow these steps:\n1. Type 'button.dispose'.\n2. Do not look at the code assist list that appears.\n3. Note that the list contains two items: DISPOSED intWidgetdispose() voidWidget.\n4. Type '('.\n5. Observe that the automatic code assist inserts the selected item."}
