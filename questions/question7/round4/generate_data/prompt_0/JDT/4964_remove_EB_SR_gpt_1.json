{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: `button.DISPOSED` which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a `(` and that this matches `dispose()` far better than `DISPOSED`. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type `button.dispose`, the automatic code assist feature pops up a list of options. However, I do not notice this because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose(). Then, I type `(` to complete the line as `button.dispose();`. But as soon as I type `(`, the automatic code assist inserts whatever is currently selected from the list.", "EB": "When typing `button.dispose`, I expect the automatic code assist feature to recognize that `dispose()` is a better match than `DISPOSED`, especially when I type `(` right after. If it cannot determine the best match, I suggest it should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Write SWT code that includes the line `button.dispose`.\n2. Type `(` immediately after `dispose`.\n3. Observe that the automatic code assist feature inserts an option from the list, even if it doesn't match the expected behavior."}
