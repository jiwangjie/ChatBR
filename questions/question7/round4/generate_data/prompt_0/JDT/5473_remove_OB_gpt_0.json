In this specific scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least until the first non-whitespace character.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a default text editor. 2. Type in the following lines of text: \n   - Line 1: [space][tab]some text\n   - Line 2: [tab]some text2\n   Ensure that the first line has a tab character and the second line has only spaces for indentation. \n3. Highlight both lines of text. \n4. Use the ShiftLeft command. \n   Expected result: The text should be shifted to the left, with the second line indented to the same level as the first line visually. \n   Actual result: The text does not move at all, which is unexpected."}
