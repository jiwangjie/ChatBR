However, the search does not yield any results because it does not consider the fully qualified name.", "EB": "The search process should first attempt to find the Java element based on the fully qualified name. If that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the package view\n2. Select a package\n3. Open the search dialog\n4. Enter a declaration to search for\n5. Execute the search\n6. Note that no results are returned"}
