When replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces, both lines are indented visually. However, when ShiftLeft is executed, only the second line moves, while the first line remains unchanged. Additionally, if there is a stray space in the first line, the text does not shift at all, which is confusing.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce:  1. Open a default text editor. 2. Type in the following:  <space<tabsome text<tabsome text2. 3. Highlight the two lines above and execute the ShiftLeft command. Notice that nothing moves."}
