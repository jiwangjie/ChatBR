{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or check performed to confirm that the output directory (bin directory) can be deleted and rebuilt. This can lead to issues when the output folder is pointed at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a user creates a new project, there should be a confirmation or check performed to ensure that the output directory (bin directory) can be deleted and rebuilt without causing any issues or data loss.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n3. Proceed with the project creation process.\n4. Check if there is any confirmation or check performed to ensure the bin directory can be scrubbed and rebuilt."}
