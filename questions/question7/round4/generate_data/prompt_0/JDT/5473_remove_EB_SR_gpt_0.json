", "OB": "When the tab character is replaced with spaces in the first line so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing the ShiftLeft command causes the text to move. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the given scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). However, in the current behavior, if there is a stray space, it is confusing why the text does not shift.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the ShiftLeft command is executed, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should also be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). It should not be influenced by the presence of stray spaces.", "SR": "To reproduce:  \n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same.  \n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command."}
