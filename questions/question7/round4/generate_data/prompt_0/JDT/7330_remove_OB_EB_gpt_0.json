I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, it seems like the actions are distributed based on personal preference. This should be changed to make it clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without forcing users to switch views.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the Edit (or any other global) menu, but it can be found when switching to the Outline view.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be easily accessible to users from the editor, without having to switch to a different view.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the editor. 2. Select a block of text. 3. Try to find the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the Edit menu."}
