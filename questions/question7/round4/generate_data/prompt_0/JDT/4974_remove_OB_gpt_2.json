{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "The bug report does not provide any information about the observed behavior.", "EB": "The bug report suggests that the setting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process that checks both classpath and output location at once. Additionally, it mentions that the error message displayed should be modified to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n  1. Create a new project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n  2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
