The first and second column could be merged.", "OB": "The marking between the button and the list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "EB": "Expect the marking between the button and the list to be appropriately sized. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog. The table should have a label for mnemonic purposes. Multiple selections should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview should be a wrapping label. Ideally, the signature preview should have the background color set to match a hover state.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog.\n2. Navigate to the first page where name validation is duplicated.\n3. Observe the large marking between the button and the list.\n4. Note the misalignment of the top button with the dialog top.\n5. Check for the absence of a label on the table.\n6. Attempt to select multiple items and apply move up / down.\n7. Verify the signature preview is not a wrapping label.\n8. Check the background color of the signature preview for hover state consistency."}
