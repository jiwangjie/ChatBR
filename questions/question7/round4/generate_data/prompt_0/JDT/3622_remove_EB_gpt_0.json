It is unclear what this message means or if it is an error. It is also unclear if the message should be displayed in red with an error icon. Discussions indicate that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Additionally, users are uncertain about how to create a default package, as it cannot be created by the user and is always present.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Create a new Java project.\n2. Select the project.\n3. Invoke the New Java Package wizard."}
