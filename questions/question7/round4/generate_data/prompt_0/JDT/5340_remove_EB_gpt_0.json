{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When trying to add an exception breakpoint, canceling the operation does not have any effect. The progress dialog that appears closes immediately. After the cancellation, the exception list still comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. The cancel button in the progress dialog should either be disabled or the cancellation request should be honored. Currently, it is not working as expected.", "EB": "The cancel button should disable the progress dialog when clicked during the addition of an exception breakpoint. Alternatively, if cancellation is not possible, the cancel button should be disabled or grayed out. The exception list should not appear if the operation has been canceled.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective\n2) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception\n3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
