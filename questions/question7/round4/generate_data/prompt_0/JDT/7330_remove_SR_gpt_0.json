I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "When I right-click on a selected text, the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not visible in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the context menu when I right-click on a selected text.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Select some text in the editor.\n2. Right-click on the selected text and observe the context menu for the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action."}
