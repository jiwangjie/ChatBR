{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622: New Package Wizard has confusing message (1GD0L9O)", "description": "Bug 3622: New Package Wizard has confusing message (1GD0L9O)", "OB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' feature, a message appears at the top before entering any package name: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. The package name field is empty at this point. The meaning of this message is unclear, and it is unclear whether it represents an error. Additionally, it is suggested that if it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. Notes from EG state that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Notes from MA suggest that it is a warning and the message will be removed. EG raises an additional issue about creating a default package, mentioning that it cannot be created by the user since it is always there.", "EB": "The message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should be clarified to provide a clear indication of its meaning. If it is an error, it should be displayed in red with an error icon. If it is a warning, it should be visually differentiated as such. The 'Finish' button should be disabled when the package name field is empty to prevent confusion. Additionally, clarification is needed on how to create a default package, as it currently cannot be created by the user.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Create a new Java Project. \n2. Select the project. \n3. Invoke the 'New Java Package' feature."}
