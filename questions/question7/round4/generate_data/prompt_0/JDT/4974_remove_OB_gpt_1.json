{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "The setting of classpath and output location should be combined into one operation, similar to the validation process. Additionally, the error message should be improved to accurately state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
