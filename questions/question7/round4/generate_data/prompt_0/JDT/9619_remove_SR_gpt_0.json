Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName\nf. The label could say 'Select destination type:'\ng. Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes)\nc. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog\ne. Destination type can be source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "The Browse button is too small and needs to be resized. The title is being used for long text instead of displaying the appropriate message. When moving to the next page, the message 'Type not found' is shown instead of the expected behavior. The dialog shows types from folders other than the source folders of the own project. When the destination type is the same as the source type, refactoring incorrectly warns that this will result in errors and makes pseudochanges in all referencing classes.", "EB": "The title should be used for 'Move static field(s)' and the description should be utilized for 'x fields from xx'. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Notice the Browse button size is too small.\n3. Enter long text into the dialog.\n4. Proceed to the next page.\n5. Observe the incorrect message 'Type not found'.\n6. Check the displayed types in the dialog and note that it includes types from folders other than the source folders of the own project.\n7. Try to move the static member to the same type as the source type and see the incorrect warning and pseudochanges in all referencing classes."}
