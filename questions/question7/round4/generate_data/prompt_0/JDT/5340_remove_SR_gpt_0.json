Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The progress dialog should honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. When calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancelable parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Open the software. 2) Add an exception breakpoint. 3) Cancel the operation.
