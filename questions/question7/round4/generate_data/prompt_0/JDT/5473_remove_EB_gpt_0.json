In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, i.e., get rid of the tab. It is also observed that there is confusion when there is a stray space, as the user doesn't understand why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a default text editor\n2. Type in the following:\n   - Space\n   - Tab\n   - Some text\n   - Tab\n   - Some text 2\n3. Highlight the two lines above\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command\n5. Notice that nothing moves"}
