Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose' and then '(' without realizing that the code assist list is up, the code assist automatically inserts the selected item in the list, resulting in 'button.DISPOSED'.", "EB": "The code assist should be smarter in recognizing that when I type 'button.dispose(' it should suggest 'dispose()' rather than 'DISPOSED'. It should also be case sensitive during automatic insertion of code suggestions.", "SR": "1. Open the SWT code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Type '(' without realizing that the code assist list is up.\n4. Observe that the code assist automatically inserts the selected item from the list."}
