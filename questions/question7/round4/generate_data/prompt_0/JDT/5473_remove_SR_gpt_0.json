Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing the ShiftLeft action causes the text to move. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character where the tab is replaced. This behavior is confusing, especially if there is a stray space, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing the ShiftLeft action should shift the text. In the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character where the tab is replaced.

Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces, aligning the two lines visually.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft action.\n3. Observe that the text moves."}
