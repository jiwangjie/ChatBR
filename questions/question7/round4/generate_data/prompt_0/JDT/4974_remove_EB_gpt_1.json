{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the user presses OK after making changes to the project properties, an error message appears stating: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem stems from the fact that setting the output location and classpath are treated as separate operations. When the first operation is set, it creates an illegal state.", "EB": "The expected behavior of the 'copy package' operation in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui in jdt.ui3 is not mentioned.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Access the project properties and change the settings to use the project as both the source folder and output location."}
