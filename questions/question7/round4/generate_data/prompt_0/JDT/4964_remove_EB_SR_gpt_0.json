{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with:\nbutton.DISPOSED\nwhich isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time.\nCode assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'.\nEither that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in build 204, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose() voidWidget'. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type '(', the automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Observe any code assist suggestions that appear.\n4. Type '(' immediately after 'dispose' without selecting any code assist suggestion.\n5. Verify if the code assist inserts undesired content instead of completing the expected function call 'dispose();'."}
