{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, the system does not confirm that the bin directory can be deleted then rebuilt. As a result, some users are creating projects with output folders pointing at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, the software should confirm that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This confirmation will prevent users from creating projects with output folders pointing at a bin directory that contains unnecessary files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software and navigate to the project creation interface. \n2. Choose 'Use existing directory structure' option. \n3. Select a bin directory as the output folder. \n4. Proceed to create the project. \n\nThe software should display a confirmation dialog stating that the bin directory will be deleted and recreated during the project creation process. It should also provide the option to proceed or cancel the project creation."}
