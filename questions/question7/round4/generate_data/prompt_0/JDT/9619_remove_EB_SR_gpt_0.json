{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details 20020212a. Mnemonicsb. No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. A label could say 'Select destination type:'g. The browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes)c. The title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.e. The destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "The browse button is too small in size. The title is used for long text, causing it to display 'Type not found' when navigating to the next page. The dialog shows types from folders other than the source folders of the current project. Refactoring incorrectly warns about errors when making the destination type the same as the source type, leading to pseudo-changes in referencing classes.", "EB": "The browse button should have a standard size using SWTUtil. The title should not be used for long text and should display relevant information. The dialog should only show types from the source folders of the current project. Refactoring should not incorrectly warn about errors or make pseudo-changes when the destination type is the same as the source type.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Observe the small size of the browse button.\n3. Proceed to the next page and note the incorrect 'Type not found' message.\n4. Notice that the dialog shows types from folders other than the source folders of the current project.\n5. Perform a refactoring operation with the destination type being the same as the source type and observe the incorrect warning and pseudo-changes in referencing classes."}
