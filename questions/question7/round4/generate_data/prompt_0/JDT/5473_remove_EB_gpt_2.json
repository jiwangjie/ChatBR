{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces, and the two lines are indented the same visually, executing ShiftLeft does not shift any text. It is not clear how this behavior is specified, but in this scenario, it is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab). It is confusing when there is a stray space as it prevents the text from shifting.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the ShiftLeft command is executed, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should also be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). It should not be influenced by the presence of stray spaces.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following lines:\n   - [space]<tab>some text\n   - <tab>some text\n   Make sure there is a tab character before 'some text' in the first line.\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nObserve that no text moves."}
