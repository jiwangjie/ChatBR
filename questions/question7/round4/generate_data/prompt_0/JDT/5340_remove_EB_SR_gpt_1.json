{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint in the software, the cancelation request is ignored and the progress dialog closes immediately. The expected behavior is for the software to either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button during this process. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the value 'false' should be passed for the 'canceleable' parameter.", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The software should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button during the process of adding an exception breakpoint.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the breakpoint settings.\n3. Add an exception breakpoint.\n4. Attempt to cancel the process of adding the exception breakpoint.\n5. Observe that the progress dialog closes immediately and the cancellation request is ignored."}
