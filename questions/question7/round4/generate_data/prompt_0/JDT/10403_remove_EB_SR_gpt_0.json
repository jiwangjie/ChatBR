{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation whether the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Point the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files. \n3. Verify that there is no confirmation or prompt to indicate whether the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt."}
