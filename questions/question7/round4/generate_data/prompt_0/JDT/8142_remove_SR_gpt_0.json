I don't understand it.", "OB": "When I navigate to the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), I get the message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. BTW, what does the message mean?", "EB": "When I navigate to the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project, such as org.apache.ant, I expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. However, I am currently getting the message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would like the software to display the class hierarchies as expected. Additionally, it would be helpful if the message provided a clearer explanation of what it means.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:\n1. Open a binary project in the software.\n2. Navigate to the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant).\n3. Observe the message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'."}
