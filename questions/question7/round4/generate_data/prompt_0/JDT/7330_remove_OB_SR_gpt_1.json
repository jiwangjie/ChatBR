I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. The action should be accessible in the Edit (or some other global) menu. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference, which should be changed. Users should be able to access all actions from the editor, without the need to switch views.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the current view.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the Edit (or some other global) menu.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the editor. 2. Select some text. 3. Attempt to find the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the Edit (or some other global) menu."}
