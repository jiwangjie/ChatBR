Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for superclass), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName\nf. The label could say 'Select destination type:'\ng. I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'\n\nd. Selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.\nh.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Browse offers\n2. Select a type from a CU in a different project."}
