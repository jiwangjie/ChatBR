{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, when typing 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist list appears. I type '(' expecting the line to be 'button.dispose();'. However, as soon as I type the '(', the code assist inserts whatever item is selected.", "EB": "", "SR": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, follow these steps to reproduce the issue: \n1. Start typing 'button.dispose'\n2. Note that the code assist list appears\n3. Type '(' expecting the line to be 'button.dispose();'\n4. Observe that the code assist inserts the selected item instead."}
