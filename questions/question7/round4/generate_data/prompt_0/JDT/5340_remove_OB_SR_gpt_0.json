{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint and cancelling the process, the progress dialog closes immediately. However, the exception list still appears and ignores the cancellation request.", "EB": "The progress dialog should either honor the cancellation request and not display the exception list, or disable the cancel button to prevent users from attempting to cancel the operation. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancelable parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1) Open the exception breakpoint dialog.\n2) Add an exception breakpoint.\n3) While the progress dialog is visible, click the cancel button."}
