Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName method should exist f. The label could say 'Select destination type:' g.", "OB": "The selection dialog does not initialize with the type currently entered.", "EB": "I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the selection dialog for moving static field(s).\n2. Enter a type in the type field.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the selection dialog for moving static field(s).\n5. Observe that the type previously entered is not initialized in the dialog."}
