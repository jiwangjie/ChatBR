It is unclear why the text won't shift and it can be confusing.", "EB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually. After executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab. This behavior needs clarification in the specifications.", "SR": "1. Open the document with lines containing both tabs and spaces in the indentation.\n2. Replace the tab character with spaces in the first line.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft function.\n4. Observe that the text does not move correctly."}
