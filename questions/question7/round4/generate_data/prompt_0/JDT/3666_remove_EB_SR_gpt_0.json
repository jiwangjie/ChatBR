This issue can be replicated by following the steps provided in the description.", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me\n\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code assist feature should stop consuming code at the correct position. In this case, it should stop after the first 'foo()' method call, resulting in the code 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())'.", "SR": "1. Open the provided class 'X'.\n2. Locate the 'bar' method.\n3. Add a parameter to the 'baz' method call in the 'bar' method.\n4. Save the changes and observe the code assist feature."}
