{"id": "8142", "title": "No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "I am encountering an issue with the scoped type hierarchy on binary projects. I am attempting to access the class hierarchies of internal jars in a binary project, but when I open the type hierarchy view for a specific class (e.g., org.apache.ant), I receive the following error message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. However, I am confused by the meaning of this error message.", "OB": "When opening the type hierarchy view for a class in a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant' is displayed.", "EB": "When opening the type hierarchy view for a class in a binary project, I expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:  1. Open a binary project.  2. Open the type hierarchy view.  3. Select a class (e.g., org.apache.ant) to view its type hierarchy."}
