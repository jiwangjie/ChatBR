{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "Upon performing the specified steps, the project properties do not update the source folder and output location as expected. Instead, the changes only affect the source folder, leaving the output location unchanged.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and output location, both settings should be updated simultaneously. The output location should reflect the project's directory, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the build process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Navigate to the project properties.\n3. Change the setting to use the project as both the source folder and output location.\n4. Observe that the output location does not update accordingly."}
