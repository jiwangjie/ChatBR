{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes. JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) etc.", "OB": "The All types dialog in the software displays obfuscated classes from JDK 1.4, such as classes with names like 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd'.", "EB": "The obfuscated classes should be less prominent in the All types dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software and navigate to the All types dialog.\n2. Observe that obfuscated classes from JDK 1.4, like 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd', are displayed.\n3. Take note of the prominence of these obfuscated classes.\n\nPossible steps to resolve the issue:\na) Sort the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter.\nb) Filter out the obfuscated classes completely.\n\nIt is suggested to implement option a) as the resolution."}
