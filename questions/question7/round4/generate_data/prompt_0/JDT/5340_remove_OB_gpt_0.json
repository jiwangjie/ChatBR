{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint in the debug perspective, if the cancel button is clicked in the progress dialog, the exception breakpoint is still added and the progress dialog closes immediately.", "EB": "The progress dialog should honor the cancellation request and not add the exception breakpoint when the cancel button is clicked. Alternatively, the cancel button should be disabled when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run with the 'cancellable' parameter set to false.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. \n2) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception breakpoint. \n3) In the progress dialog, click the cancel button."}
