{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "Upon creating a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. Some users create projects and set the output folder to a bin directory, which may contain more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When creating a new project, we should have a confirmation step ensuring that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt successfully. This is crucial, especially for users who set the output folder to a bin directory containing files beyond .class files that can be regenerated from the available .java files.", "SR": "1. Open the application and navigate to the project creation section.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure.\n3. Set the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n4. Follow the project creation process.\n5. Observe the lack of confirmation regarding the ability to delete and rebuild the output directory."}
