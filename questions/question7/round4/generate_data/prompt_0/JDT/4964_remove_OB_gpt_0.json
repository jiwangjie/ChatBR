{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED, which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When typing 'button.dispose', the code assist feature inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.", "EB": "The code assist feature should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' since it matches the typed text better.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the IDE (Build 204).\n2. Start writing SWT code.\n3. Type 'button.dispose' in the code editor.\n4. Observe that the code assist feature suggests 'DISPOSED'. "}
