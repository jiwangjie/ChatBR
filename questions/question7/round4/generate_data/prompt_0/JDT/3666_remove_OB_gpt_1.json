As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the `baz` call in `bar` to make the program correct.", "OB": "The code is currently `baz(x.foo())` in the `bar` method.", "EB": "The code should be changed to `baz(x.foo().foo())` in the `bar` method.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Change the `baz` call to `baz(x.x.foo())`.\n2. Place the cursor after the first `x.`.\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist.\n4. Type `f` to filter the list.\n5. Select `foo()`."}
