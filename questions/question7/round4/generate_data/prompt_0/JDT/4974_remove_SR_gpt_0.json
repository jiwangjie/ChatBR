{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the 'Ok' button is pressed, an error message is displayed, stating 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, causing an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: The setting of classpath / output location should be combined into a single operation. Similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location simultaneously, there should be an option to set both of them together. Furthermore, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
