{"id": "6536", "title": "Bug 6536: Add Javadoc on field in Type Hierarchy does nothing", "description": "When attempting to add Javadoc on a field in the Type Hierarchy view, the expected behavior is not met.", "OB": "Clicking on the 'Add Javadoc' option for a field in the Type Hierarchy view does not result in any action or change. No Javadoc information is added, and the interface remains unchanged.", "EB": "When selecting 'Add Javadoc' on a field in the Type Hierarchy view, we expect the system to display the Javadoc editor or provide a means to input documentation for the selected field. This should facilitate the addition of Javadoc comments for better code documentation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the Type Hierarchy view.\n2. Select a field within the Type Hierarchy.\n3. Right-click on the selected field to open the context menu.\n4. Choose the 'Add Javadoc' option.\n5. Observe that no action occurs, and the Javadoc editor or input field does not appear."}
