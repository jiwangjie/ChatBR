{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing OK, an error message appears: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This issue occurs because setting the output location and classpath are currently separate operations, resulting in an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "To resolve this bug (4974), the setting of classpath and output location should be combined into one operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software\n2. Go to the settings or preferences section\n3. Set the classpath\n4. Set the output location\n5. Press OK\n6. Observe the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'"}
