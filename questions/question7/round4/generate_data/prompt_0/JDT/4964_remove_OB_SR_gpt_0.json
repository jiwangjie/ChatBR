{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The automatic code assist feature does not suggest the expected code completion options.", "EB": "The automatic code assist feature should prioritize suggesting code completion options that match the current context, such as matching parentheses or case sensitivity.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing a method name that matches multiple options.\n3. Observe the suggestions provided by the automatic code assist feature and select one that does not match the current context (e.g., lowercase instead of uppercase).\n4. Notice that the inserted code is incorrect and requires manual deletion and re-entry.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for different scenarios to confirm the issue."}
