Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, when typing \"button.dispose\", the automatic code assist list pops up with the following items: DISPOSED, intWidget, dispose(), voidWidget. As soon as I type \"(\", the code assist inserts whatever item is selected from the list.", "EB": "The code assist should be smarter and recognize that when I type \"(\", it should prioritize suggesting \"dispose()\" instead of \"DISPOSED\". It should also be case sensitive when automatically inserting code snippets.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue in Build 204: \n1. Start typing SWT code \n2. Type \"button.dispose\" \n3. Pay attention to the code assist list that pops up and notice the available suggestions \n4. Type \"(\" and observe which suggestion is automatically inserted by the code assist feature"}
