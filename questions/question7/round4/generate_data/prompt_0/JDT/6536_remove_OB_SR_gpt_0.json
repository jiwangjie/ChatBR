{"id": "6536", "title": "Bug 6536: Add Javadoc on field in TH does nothing", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to add Javadoc on a field in TH (presumably a software or code editor), selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu does not result in any action or changes. ", "EB": "I expect that selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu should add the Javadoc to the field. Alternatively, if this feature is not intended to be functional, the 'Add Javadoc' option should be removed from the menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the TH (presumably a software or code editor) program.\n2. Navigate to a field that does not have Javadoc.\n3. Right-click on the field to open the context menu.\n4. From the context menu, select the 'Add Javadoc' option.\n5. Observe that nothing happens, no changes or action is taken on the field."}
