{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED, which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time.\nCode assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The automatic code assist suggests 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()' when I type '(' after 'button'.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' when I type '(' after 'button'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code.\n2. Type the following: button.dispose\n3. Do not notice that the code assist list is up because you are not looking at it."}
