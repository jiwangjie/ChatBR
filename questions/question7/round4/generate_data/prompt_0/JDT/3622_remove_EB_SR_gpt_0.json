This message appears before any input is entered. Users are confused about the meaning and purpose of this message and whether it indicates an error. There have been suggestions to display this message in red with an error icon if it is indeed an error.", "EB": "The message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should not be displayed when the package name field is empty. If this message is displayed, it should be clear whether it is an error or a warning. Consider displaying it in red with an error icon if it indicates an error. Alternatively, if it is not an error, the wording should be modified to clarify its purpose.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Open the New Java Package wizard.\n2. Do not enter any value in the package name field.\n3. Observe the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' at the top of the wizard."}
