{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the system does not confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. As a result, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The system should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure. This is necessary to prevent users from pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains unnecessary files and can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Point the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files. \n3. Verify that the system does not confirm the ability to delete and rebuild the output directory."}
