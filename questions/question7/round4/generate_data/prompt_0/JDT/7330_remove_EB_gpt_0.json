I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste, which should be changed. It is unclear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions need to be reachable from the editor, and it is not acceptable to force users to switch views.", "OB": "When selecting text, the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu when selecting text.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select text in the editor and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available in the context menu. If not, switch to the Outline view and verify if the action is present in the context menu via the Edit menu."}
