If the date string is invalid, it should be rejected with an error message. (2) The date value should be stored correctly in the report design.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the BIRT report designer. 2. Create a new report parameter and set its type as 'DateTime'. 3. In the 'default value' field, enter an invalid date string, such as '55/66/9999'. 4. Save the report design. 5. Close and reopen the report design. Verify that the invalid date value is still present in the 'default value' field."}
