After closing the data set editor and reopening it, the children node is still not listed.", "EB": "The children should be listed when changing the data source. The new data source should display the children nodes.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a new data set without a SQL statement.\n2. Choose a data source that has no database/table/column information.\n3. Attempt to change the data source for the data set.\n4. Observe that the children node listing does not appear.\n5. Close the data set editor and reopen it to confirm that the children node is still not listed."}
