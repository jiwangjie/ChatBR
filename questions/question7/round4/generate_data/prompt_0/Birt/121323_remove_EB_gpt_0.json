{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When an XPath expression is entered for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation class gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping that includes a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Verify that the data stored in filterInfo is lost after leaving the dialog."}
