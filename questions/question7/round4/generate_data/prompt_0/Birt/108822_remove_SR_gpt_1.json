{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient disk sorting logic expected for border values in row value", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk, if there are 40000 rows and the program is configured to only process data less than 40000 rows, the software performs the following operation:", "EB": "There should be a more efficient logic implemented for sorting data on disk when there are border values for the row count. This could include sorting the data directly in memory and then writing it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Set up a dataset with 40000 rows of data.\n2. Configure the program to process the data up to a limit of less than 40000 rows.\n3. Sort the data on disk and observe the performance and resource usage."}
