The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 06/30/05, I see the schema filter, however I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being listed.
