{"id": "108822", "title": "More robust logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is a border value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting on disk, if sorting on 40,000 rows of data and setting the program to process the data less than 40,000, the program performs the following operations:", "EB": "The program should handle the border value for row count appropriately when sorting on disk, ensuring all the data is processed correctly.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Set up a data set with 40,000 rows.\n2. Enable sorting on disk functionality.\n3. Configure the program to process the data less than the total number of rows.\n4. Initiate the sorting process and observe the outcome."}
