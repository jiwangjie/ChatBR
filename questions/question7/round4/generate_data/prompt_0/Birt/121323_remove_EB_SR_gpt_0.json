However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information, including the XPath expression and the selection part, so that it is not lost when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Verify that the filter information, including the XPath expression and the selection part, is persisted and not lost."}
