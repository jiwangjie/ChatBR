{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the report design stores the absolute path of the library include. For example, <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>. The absolute path is not ideal, and we need to save the relative path instead. Additionally, the property name <property name=\"namespace\">lib1</property> is included.", "EB": "The report designer should generate and store the relative path when a library is included in the report design. The absolute path should be replaced with a relative path. The property name <property name=\"fileName\"> should contain the relative path instead of the absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open a report design in the BIRT designer.\n2. Include a library from a location outside of the project directory by providing a relative path.\n3. Save the report design.\n4. Verify that the library include property <property name=\"fileName\"> now contains the relative path and not the absolute path."}
