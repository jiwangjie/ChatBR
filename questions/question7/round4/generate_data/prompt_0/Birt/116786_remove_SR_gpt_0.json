{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path for the included library. For example, <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>. The library name and namespace are also specified in the report design as <property name=\"namespace\" value=\"lib1\"/>. ", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the library's relative path. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, the path should be saved as relative to that location.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Check the generated XML to verify if the library path is saved as relative to the report design location."}
