The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "Currently, the tables and columns in the data source are loaded immediately upon opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page.", "EB": "The tables and columns in the data source should be loaded on demand, meaning that they should be loaded only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query. Observe that the tables and columns are loaded without any user interaction. The expected behavior is that the tables and columns should be loaded only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter."}
