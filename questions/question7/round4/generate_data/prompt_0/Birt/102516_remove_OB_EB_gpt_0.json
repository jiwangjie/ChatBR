The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema at once. This would improve performance and prevent the 'Only 500 items can be viewed' message from appearing.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor.\n2. Notice that the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load.\n3. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed."}
