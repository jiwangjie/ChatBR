The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes time to load. Eventually, it shows the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This would improve performance and prevent the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the data set editor\n2. Notice the delay while the entire schema is queried\n3. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed"}
