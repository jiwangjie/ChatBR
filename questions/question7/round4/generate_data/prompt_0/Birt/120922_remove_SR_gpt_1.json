Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The prompt displays the options: 'Yes', 'No', 'Cancel'. 'Yes' saves the changes, 'No' discards the changes, and 'Cancel' does nothing and remains on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog is titled 'Error'.", "OB": "When the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor is edited and an attempt is made to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the changes need to be saved. The current problem is that the user has to figure out how to save or discard the changes, and the error message is not informative enough. The error message is: 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more user-friendly approach would be to display a dialog with a clearer title. The dialog should inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open the XML Report Designer. 2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor. 3. Try to switch back to the Layout view. 4. Observe the error message indicating the need to save the changes."}
