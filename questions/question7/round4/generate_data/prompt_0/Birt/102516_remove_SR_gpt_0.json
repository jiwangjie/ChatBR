{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed. With the code in CVS from 6/30/05, the schema filter works, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated immediately.", "OB": "When using the JTOpen JDBC drivers on the iSeries platform, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query displays every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being shown. The tree is populated on load, causing a warning message to be displayed.", "EB": "The load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on an iSeries platform. 2. Use the JTOpen JDBC drivers. 3. Observe that the tree control displays every schema on the system and several hundred tables are shown. 4. Note the warning message that is displayed on load. 5. Expand the tree or apply a filter to see if the warning message still appears."}
