{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient disk sorting logic with border value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk using the program, if the data consists of 40000 rows and the program is set to process less than 40000 rows, the following operations are performed:\n1. The file is saved as a temporary file.\n2. The file is loaded into memory.\n3. The data is sorted.\n4. The sorted data is saved to the temporary file.", "EB": "The disk sorting logic should be improved to handle border values for the row count more efficiently.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set the program to sort data on disk.\n2. Create a dataset with 40000 rows.\n3. Configure the program to process less than 40000 rows.\n4. Perform the sorting operation.\n5. Verify the behavior of the program during the sorting process."}
