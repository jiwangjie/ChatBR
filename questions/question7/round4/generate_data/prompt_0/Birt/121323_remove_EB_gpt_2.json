{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information properly. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping and including a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to potential issues.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information, including the XPath expression and the selection part, so that it is not lost when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping and include a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check the .rptdesign file to see that the RelationInformation is persisted, but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost."}
