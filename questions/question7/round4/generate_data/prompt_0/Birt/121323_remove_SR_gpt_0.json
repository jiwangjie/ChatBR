{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior might cause trouble.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information. Instead of stripping the selection from the XPath expression, the plain XPath expression should be used (prepended with the path from the data set selector) and the filtering should be left to the users who need it.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, like 'section[@id='left']', for the column mapping. \n3. Leave the dialog. \n4. Check if the filter information is persisted correctly."}
