The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message displayed on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed. There is a warning message displayed on load.", "EB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers should only load tables and columns on demand, instead of loading all schemas and tables on load. This will improve the performance and usability of the editor.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform.\n2. Observe that the tree control displays every schema and table on load.\n3. Note the warning message displayed during the load process."}
