{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return some user recognizable strings", "description": "", "OB": "When using the getcolumnlabel function on the meta data object, it does not return any user recognizable strings. Instead, it returns some arbitrary labels or values that are not meaningful to the end user.", "EB": "The getcolumnlabel function should return user recognizable strings. These labels need to be displayed to the end user before performing any extraction. Therefore, the getcolumnlabel function should return the same labels as those shown after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a meta data object.\n2. Use the getcolumnlabel function on a specific column.\n3. Observe the returned label and compare it with the label displayed after extraction."}
