For example, <property name='fileName' value='/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>. This is incorrect and should be changed to store the relative path instead.", "EB": "The report design should store the relative path of the library include. For example, <property name='fileName' value='lib1.rptlibrary'/>.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design that includes a library.\n2. Check the 'fileName' property of the library include.\n3. Note that it currently contains the absolute path.\n4. Modify the report design to store the relative path instead.\n5. Save and validate the report design.\n6. Verify that the 'fileName' property now contains the relative path."}
