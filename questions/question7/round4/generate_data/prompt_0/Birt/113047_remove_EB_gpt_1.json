Upon creating a new data set without an SQL statement, and changing the data source in the data set editor's data source page to a new one that does not have any database/table/column information, the expected children nodes are not displayed. The issue persists even after closing the data set editor and reopening it.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement.\n2.
