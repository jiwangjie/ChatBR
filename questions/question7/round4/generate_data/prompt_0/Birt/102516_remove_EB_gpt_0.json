{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This easily results in several hundred tables. The current code in CVS from 6/30/05 has a schema filter, but there is a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, when opening the data set editor, the entire schema is queried and the tree control showing every schema, which is several hundred tables, is loaded. This results in a warning message stating that only 500 items can be viewed in the available list.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, instead of querying the entire schema and loading all the tables at once. The schema should be filtered based on the selected source and the loading process should be optimized to avoid the warning message.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open the data set editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers. Notice the warning message and the delay in populating the tree control due to the loading of the entire schema."}
