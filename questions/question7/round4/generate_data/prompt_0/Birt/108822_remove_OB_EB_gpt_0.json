Sort a dataset containing 40000 rows on disk \n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000 \n3. Observe that the program performs the following operations: \n     a. Saves the file as a temporary file \n     b. Calls the file to memory \n     c. Performs the sorting on the data \n     d. Saves the file to a temporary file"}
