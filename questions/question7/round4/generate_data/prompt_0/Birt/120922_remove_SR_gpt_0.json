Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. Do you want to save the changes? [Yes] [No] [Cancel]. 'Yes' would save the changes, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page. In addition, the dialog is titled 'Error'.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. This is a problem because the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes or discard them, which is even harder. The error message is not very clear as it is simply 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog needs to use a better title and should not have quotes around it.", "SR": ""}
