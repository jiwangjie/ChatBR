The data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, copy the file to the destination folder and observe the incorrect sorting of the data when there is a border value for the row. The expected behavior is to have a more efficient logic that directly sorts the data in memory and then writes it to the file"}
