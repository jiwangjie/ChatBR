As a result, whenever the dialog is closed and reopened, the filter information needs to be entered again.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist and save the filter information entered by the user. This way, when the dialog is closed and reopened, the previously entered filter information should still be present.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter some filter information.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the dialog.\n5. Check whether the previously entered filter information is still present."}
