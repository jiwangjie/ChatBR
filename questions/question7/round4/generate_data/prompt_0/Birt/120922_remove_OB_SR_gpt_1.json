Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. A dialog appears with the message: 'Do you want to save the changes?'. It provides three options: 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. If 'Yes' is chosen, the changes will be saved. If 'No' is chosen, the changes will be discarded. If 'Cancel' is chosen, nothing happens and the user remains on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "The 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor is causing inconvenience to users. The dialog titled 'Error' is not appropriate for this situation.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog with a clear title indicating that the XML Report Design has been changed. The title should not include quotes.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:<br>1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.<br>2. Make changes to the XML report design.<br>3. Try accessing other pages without saving the changes.<br>4. Observe the 'Dirty Page' behavior and the dialog with the inappropriate title."}
