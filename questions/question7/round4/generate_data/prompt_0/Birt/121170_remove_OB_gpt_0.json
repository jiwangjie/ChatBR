{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170: getColumnLabel from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "When calling the method getColumnLabel() from the IMetaData object, it should return user recognizable strings. Currently, the returned labels are not recognizable to the user. Since these labels are displayed to the end user before and after data extraction, getColumnLabel() should return the same labels both before and after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Call the method IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before extracting the data. \n2. Call the method IMetaData.getColumnLabel() after extracting the data. \n3. Compare the results from both calls and observe the difference in the labels returned."}
