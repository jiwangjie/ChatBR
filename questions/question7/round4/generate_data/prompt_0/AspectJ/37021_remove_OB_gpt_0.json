See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the issue. There is a limitation with these tests as they may produce false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is omitted.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars in declare warning messages, the source path is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\".", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form \"app/Main\" instead of \"app.Main.class\".", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1.
