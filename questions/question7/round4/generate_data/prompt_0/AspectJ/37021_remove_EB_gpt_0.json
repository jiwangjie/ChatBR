See tests/new/binaryWarnings/ for code to reproduce the issue. Note that these tests may produce false positives due to disabled filename checking in harness verification of messages. If the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it may be omitted.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. In some cases, the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not replicate that problem.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files should be displayed in the format 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'. Additionally, the filenames should always be visible.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open tests/new/binaryWarnings/ code.\n2. Trigger the declare warning on a binary file.\n3. Observe the source path in the declare warning message."}
