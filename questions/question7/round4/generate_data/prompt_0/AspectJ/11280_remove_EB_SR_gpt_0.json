{"id": "11280", "title": "Bug 11280[View Mgmt] Switching perspectives loses view maximized state", "description": "", "OB": "When switching perspectives in the software, the view maximized state is lost. This means that if a user maximizes a view in one perspective and then switches to another perspective, the view is no longer maximized and appears in its default size or position.", "EB": "The software should retain the maximized state of views when switching perspectives. This means that if a user maximizes a view in one perspective and then switches to another perspective, the view should remain maximized and retain its size and position.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software and navigate to a perspective. \n2. Maximize a view within the perspective. \n3. Switch to another perspective. \n4. Observe that the previously maximized view is no longer maximized and appears in its default size or position."}
