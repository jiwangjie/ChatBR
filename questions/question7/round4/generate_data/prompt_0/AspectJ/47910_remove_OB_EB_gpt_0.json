However, upon inspection, it is found that the generated JAR file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The generated JAR file should include a valid MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Invoke the 'ajc' compiler with the 'sourceroots' argument set to <mydir> and the 'outjar' argument set to <my.jar>.\n2. Verify that the generated JAR file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
