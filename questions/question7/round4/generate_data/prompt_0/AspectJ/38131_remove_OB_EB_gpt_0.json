This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac.I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlyingEclipse compiler.Create a class in a subpackage such as:package subpackage;public class Test {public static void main(String[] args) {System.out.println(\"Hello\");}}Then compile using following command: ajc subpackage\\\\Test.javaYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\"directory. subpackage\\\\Test.javaor javac subpackage\\\\Test.javaNo big deal, really.
