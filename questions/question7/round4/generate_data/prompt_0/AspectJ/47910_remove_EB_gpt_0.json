{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the parameters 'sourceroots <mydir' and 'outjar <my.jar', it creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc mentions the 'outjar' parameter which implies that it should create a zip file. However, the absence of a MANIFEST.MF file suggests that it should actually create a jar file.", "EB": "The 'outjar' parameter should create a valid jar file that contains a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file, so that the resulting file can be used as a proper jar file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, execute the following command: ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar. Then, check the generated <my.jar file to verify if it contains a MANIFEST.MF file."}
