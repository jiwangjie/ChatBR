This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");\n\n\t}\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. subpackage\\Test.java or javac subpackage\\Test.java. No big deal, really.", "OB": "When using ajc to compile a class from a subpackage, a directory called \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "However, it would be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Use the command 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java' to compile the class.\n3. Observe that a directory called 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory."}
