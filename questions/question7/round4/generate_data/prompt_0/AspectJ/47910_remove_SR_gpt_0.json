The documentation for ajc implies that the outjar parameter is supposed to create a zip file, but it doesn't make sense to create a zip file with a parameter called outjar.", "OB": "When executing ajc with the sourceroots and outjar parameters, a file with the .jar extension is created, but it is not a valid jar file because it does not include a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "If the outjar parameter is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file that includes a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the ajc command with the sourceroots and outjar parameters, and check if the resulting file is a valid jar file that contains a MANIFEST.MF file."}
