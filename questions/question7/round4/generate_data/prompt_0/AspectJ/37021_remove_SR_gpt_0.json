See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for the code that can be run to reproduce the problem. It's important to note that the tests have limitations and may generate false positives due to the disabled filename checking in the harness verification of messages. In AJDT, the filename is omitted if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "When declaring warnings and targeting .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also instances where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The declare warning messages should display the source path in the format 'app/Main' when targeting .class files from injars.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Observe the source path displayed in the declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars."}
