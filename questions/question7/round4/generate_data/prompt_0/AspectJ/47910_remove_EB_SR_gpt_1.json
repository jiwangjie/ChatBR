{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When calling the ajc command with sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, an output file is created with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc mentions that the outjar parameter puts output classes in a zip file, but it doesn't make sense to create a zip file without a MANIFEST.MF file inside. It seems like the generated jarfile is missing this mandatory file.", "OB": "The generated .jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The generated .jar file should contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "1. Run the ajc command with the sourceroots parameter specifying the source directory.\n2. Use the outjar parameter to specify the output file location and name with a .jar extension.\n3. Check the contents of the generated .jar file and verify that it contains a valid MANIFEST.MF file."}
