This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nsubpackage\\Test.java or javac subpackage\\Test.java\n\nNo big deal, really.", "OB": "When compiling a class from a subpackage using the command 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java', a directory named 'subpackage' is created inside the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "EB": "But it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "SR": "Use the '-d' option when correctly compiling classes from a subpackage."}
