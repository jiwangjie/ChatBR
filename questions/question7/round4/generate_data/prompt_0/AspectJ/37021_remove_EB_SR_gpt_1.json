See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" rather than \"app/Main.\" I have also seen the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should list the sourcepath in the form \"app/Main\" instead of \"app.Main.class\". Additionally, the filenames should always appear in the declare warning messages when applicable.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Navigate to the tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. folder in the codebase.\n2. Run the code within this folder.\n3. Observe the declare warning messages and check if the sourcepath is displayed as \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\". Also, verify if the filenames appear correctly in the declare warning messages."}
