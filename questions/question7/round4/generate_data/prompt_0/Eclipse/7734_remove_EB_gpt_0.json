{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with an opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows without saving causes the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s).", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start WSWB and create a new project. 2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. 3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. 4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down or reboot the computer. 5. Verify that there is no warning or question message box prompting users to save their dirty model(s) before the computer is shut down or rebooted. Please note that other Windows programs like Word or Outlook may also exhibit this behavior."}
