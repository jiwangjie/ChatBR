System Editor', nothing happens. The workbench should display a warning message that states that the user may overwrite changes and asks if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, indicating that all files need to be closed first. This behavior is believed to be a safety feature in which the software does not allow external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "When a java file is already opened in the workbench, if an attempt is made to open the same file in another editor by right-clicking on the file and selecting 'Open With ..
