Refiltering should only happen when closing the working set selection dialog, not while manipulating the working sets. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to the working sets, including cancelling the removal of a working set.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a working set with one project and select it. This should filter the package view.\n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set. Delete the first working set."}
