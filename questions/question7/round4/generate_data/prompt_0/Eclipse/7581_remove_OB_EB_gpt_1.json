When a string in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. As a result, the drop down button may be positioned too far right and gets clipped off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should resize properly in the property sheet so that the drop down button is always fully visible within the available space.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the application and open the property sheet.\n2. Create an object with a property that requires a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Make sure one of the string options for the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. The drop down button of the ComboBoxCellEditor should now be clipped and not fully visible.\n5. Adjust the width of the property sheet until the drop down button is visible within the available space."}
