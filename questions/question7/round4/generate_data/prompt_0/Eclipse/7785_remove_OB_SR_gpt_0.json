The icon has also changed from the parent Java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When saving a file using the SaveAs functionality, the file is saved with a generic file icon instead of the expected Java file icon. Additionally, the saved file does not retain its original file type extension.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file unless explicitly changed. The saved file should also have the correct Java file icon.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open a Java file. 2. Go to the 'SaveAs' option. 3. Choose a different directory or provide a different name. 4. Save the file. 5. Check the saved file's icon and extension."}
