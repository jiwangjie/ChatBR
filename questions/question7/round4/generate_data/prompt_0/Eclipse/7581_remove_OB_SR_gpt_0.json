", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly.", "EB": "I would expect the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as DialogCellEditor (Button always visible). Will need to investigate to determine if this is an issue with our code or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Edit a property with a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the combo box does not size correctly."}
