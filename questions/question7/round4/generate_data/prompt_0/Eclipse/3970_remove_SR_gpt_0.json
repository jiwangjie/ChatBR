", "OB": "When creating a new file, the line delimiter is currently determined by the value returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "When creating a new file, even if it is on a Windows system, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) in the Workbench to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure consistency across all plugins.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter used in the new file."}
