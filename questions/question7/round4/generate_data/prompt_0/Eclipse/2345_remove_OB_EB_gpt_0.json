The current editor remains active and the file is not opened in the new editor.", "EB": "The file should be opened in a new editor of the chosen type, even if the file is already open with a different editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example.\n2. Create a new basic project.\n3. Create a new file named 'test.xml'.\n4. The editor used by default is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content.\n5. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'.\n6. Right-click and choose 'Open With...' and then select 'Default Text Editor'.\n7. Observe that nothing happens and the scripted resource editor example remains active instead of opening the file in the new editor."}
