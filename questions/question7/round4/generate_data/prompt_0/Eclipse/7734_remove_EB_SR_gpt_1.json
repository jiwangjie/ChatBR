{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately without any prompt.", "EB": "The system should display a warning or question message box when attempting to shut down with unsaved files, giving users a chance to save their work before the computer is shut down/rebooted.", "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select the 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer.\n5. Verify that there is no warning or question message box displayed. Expected behavior is that a message box should appear, allowing users to save their unsaved files before proceeding with the shutdown."}
