{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On Linux, when running build 20011127 (but not on build 20011116 on Nt2000), if a view like the Navigator is resized to a smaller size, the tool items, as well as the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), move below the label. This behavior could confuse users.", "EB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized to a smaller size, the close button should remain in its original position above the label, regardless of the size of the view. The behavior of the pulldown menu icon and other tool items should also remain consistent and not move below the label.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch the application on Linux with build 20011127. 2. Open a view, such as the Navigator. 3. Resize the view to a smaller size. 4. Observe that the tool items, pulldown menu icon, and close icon move below the label."}
