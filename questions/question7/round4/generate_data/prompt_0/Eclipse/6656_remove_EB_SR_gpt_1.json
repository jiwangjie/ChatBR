When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "OB": "When the Navigator view is resized smaller, the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon, move below the label.", "EB": "The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) should stay in their original positions and not move down when the Navigator view is resized smaller.", "SR": "1. Launch the application.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view smaller.\n4. Observe the position of the tool items, pulldown menu icon, and close icon."}
