However, this does not always meet the user's requirements.", "EB": "There should be a user interface (UI) that allows users to define the default line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open Eclipse. \n2. Create a new file. \n3. Observe the default line delimiter used. \n4. There should be a UI element or preference setting to define the default line delimiters for new files."}
