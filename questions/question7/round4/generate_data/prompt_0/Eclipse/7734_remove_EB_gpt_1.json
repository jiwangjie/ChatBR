{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. This behavior is observed despite other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) providing warning messages before shutting down.", "EB": "The system should provide a warning or question message box when shutting down, giving users a chance to save their dirty model(s) before the computer is shut down or rebooted.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open WSWB.\n2. Create a new project.\n3. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n4. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n5. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the \"Shut Down...\" command to shut down or reboot the computer.\n\nExpected result:\n- A warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their dirty model(s) before the computer is shut down or rebooted."}
