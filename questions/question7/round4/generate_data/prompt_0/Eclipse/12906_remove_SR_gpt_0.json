I expect the workbench to display a warning message indicating that opening the file in another editor may result in overwriting changes, and asking if I want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed stating that all files should be closed first. Currently, there is no warning or error message displayed.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning or error message indicating that opening the file in another editor may lead to overwriting changes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1.
