The current editor remains active and does not switch to the new editor type.", "EB": "When opening a file with a different type of editor that is already open, the software should switch to the new editor type and open the file in that editor.", "SR": "1. Open a new basic project\n2. Create a new file called 'test.xml'\n3. The file 'test.xml' is opened with the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content.\n4. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'\n5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...'\n6. Select 'Default Text Editor'\n7. Observe that nothing happens and the scripted resource editor example remains active\n\nNote: The expected behavior is that a new editor is opened on the file, using the different editor type."}
