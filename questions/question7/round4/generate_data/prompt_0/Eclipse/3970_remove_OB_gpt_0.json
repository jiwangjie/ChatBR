", "OB": "The new files created on Windows have Windows line delimiters instead of Unix line delimiters.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. A UI (Preference) should be provided in the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins to ensure the same line delimiter is used for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario: Use Unix and Windows workstations to develop a Unix product/program."}
