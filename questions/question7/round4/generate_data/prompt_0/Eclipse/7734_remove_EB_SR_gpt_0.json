{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. The steps to reproduce are as follows: start WSWB and create a new project, create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. Then, left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer. The observed behavior is that there is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) also don't display save prompts before shutting down.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
