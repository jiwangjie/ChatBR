{"id": "7734", "title": "System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When shutting down Windows with a WSWB session open and a dirty .txt file, there is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their changes. The computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.", "EB": "The system should provide a dialog box with options to save the file ('Do you want to save your file?') when shutting down, with buttons for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Cancel' should halt the shutdown process.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Start WSWB and create a new project. \n2. Create a text file within the project and add a line of text to it. \n3. Notice that the text file is marked as dirty (unsaved changes). \n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer. \n\nExpected Results: \nA dialog box should appear, asking 'Do you want to save your file?' with options for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Cancel' should halt the shutdown process."}
