{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.", "EB": "The system should provide a 'Do you want to save your file?' dialog box with options to save, not save, or cancel the shutdown. Additionally, it would be beneficial to allow applications to control the shutdown/save process or pop up their own windows to allow the user to stop the shutdown if 'cancel' is selected.", "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer."}
