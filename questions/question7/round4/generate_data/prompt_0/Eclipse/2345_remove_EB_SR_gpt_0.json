The expected behavior is that a new editor should open for the file, considering that the selected editor type is different from the one already open. However, the existing editor remains active and doesn't change. It seems that searching for an existing open file does not consider the different editor types.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when selecting 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' for a file that is already open but with a different editor type, a new editor should open for that file using the selected editor type.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the application and create a new basic project. 2. Create a new file named test.xml. 3. In the Navigator, select test.xml. 4. Right-click and choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'. 5. Observe that nothing happens, and the existing editor remains active."}
