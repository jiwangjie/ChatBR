{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not resize correctly. When a string within the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to the width of the widest item. As a result, the drop-down button may be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet and clip out of view.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column. Similar to the behavior of the DialogCellEditor, the button should always be visible. It needs to be investigated whether this issue lies within our code or the SWT library.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects. \n2. Define rows with name-value pairs in two columns using IPropertyDescriptor. \n3. Use the IPropertyDescriptor method to create a ComboBoxCellEditor, which includes a set of strings. \n4. Place the editor in column two of the property sheet. \n5. If possible, make any of the strings wider than the width of the property sheet column. \n6. Observe that the combo box grows to the width of the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
