{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet. The issue occurs when the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor are wider than the width of the property sheet column. As a result, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item, causing the drop down button to be clipped and hidden off the visible area of the property sheet. This behavior is problematic for users as they cannot see or access the combo drop down button without expanding the property sheet view.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not adjust its size correctly when the strings in the editor are wider than the width of the property sheet column. Consequently, the drop down button of the combo box is pushed too far right and clipped outside the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should resize itself to fit the width of the property sheet column, ensuring that the drop down button remains in the visible area.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the property sheet view.\n2. Create or select an object with string values that are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n3. Observe that the drop down button of the ComboBoxCellEditor is clipped and hidden off the visible area of the property sheet."}
