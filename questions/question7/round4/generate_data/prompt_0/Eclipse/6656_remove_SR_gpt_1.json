{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On Linux, running build 20011127, when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label. This behavior is not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000. The movement of the icons may confuse users.", "EB": "The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) should stay on the same line as the label regardless of the view size. The close button is expected to be located in the far right corner, on the same line as the label. The current behavior may result in usability problems as users are accustomed to the close button being present on the same line as the label.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the Navigator view. 2. Resize the view to make it smaller. Observe the movement of the pulldown menu icon and the close icon."}
