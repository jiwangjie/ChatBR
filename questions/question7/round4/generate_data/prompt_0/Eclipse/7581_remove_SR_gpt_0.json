Note that this behavior should be the same as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. We need to investigate if this issue is caused by our code or by SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Edit a field that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column."}
