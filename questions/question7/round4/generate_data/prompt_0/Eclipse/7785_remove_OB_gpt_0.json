{"id": "7785", "title": "Bug 7785: SaveAs Forgets the file type", "description": "The bug report describes an issue where the SaveAs command forgets the file type and changes the file icon from the parent Java file icon to a generic file icon. The provided information does not include the observed behavior (OB) of the bug. However, based on the provided expected behavior (EB) and steps to reproduce (SR), I can infer the following OB statement: ", "OB": "After using the SaveAs command to save a Java file, the file is saved as a generic file without any file extension. The file icon displayed also changes from the parent Java file icon to a generic file icon.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file unless explicitly changed. Additionally, the file icon should remain the same as the parent Java file icon.", "SR": "1) Open an existing Java file.\n2) Make modifications to the file.\n3) Click on the SaveAs icon next to the Save icon. A dialog will appear.\n4) Browse for a valid container location.\n5) Provide a filename without specifying the file extension.\n6) Click Ok.\n\nObserve that the file is saved with the same file extension as the original file, and the file icon remains the same as the parent Java file icon. The file should not be saved as a generic file without any file extension."}
