However, upon deleting the working set, the package view is automatically refiltered in the background.", "EB": "Expected behavior is that the package view should only be refiltered when the working set selection dialog is closed, not during the manipulation of working sets. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel any changes made to working sets, including the remove operation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a working set with one project and select it.\n2. Delete the working set.\n3. Observe the package view being automatically refiltered in the background."}
