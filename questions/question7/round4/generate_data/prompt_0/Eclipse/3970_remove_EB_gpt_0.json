However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "The software should provide a UI for the user to define the default line delimiters for new files. This way, the user can specify the desired line delimiter instead of relying on the system's default delimiter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use a Unix and a Windows workstation to develop a Unix product/program. \n2. Create a new file in Eclipse. \n3. Note that the default line delimiter is based on the system's properties, which may not always be desired by the user."}
