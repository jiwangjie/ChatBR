However, when testing the page, it was observed that the generated URL for the 'Reload' link uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "Expecting the 'Reload' link to be generated with the custom cookie name instead of 'jsessionid'. For example, the expected URL for the 'Reload' link should be http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the servlet30finalspec.pdf document.\n2. Navigate to chapter 7.1.1.\n3. Verify the mentioned behavior related to custom cookie name and URL rewriting.\n4. Test the page mentioned in the attachment 25442, which is named cookiename.war.\n5. Observe that the generated URL for the 'Reload' link uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name."}
