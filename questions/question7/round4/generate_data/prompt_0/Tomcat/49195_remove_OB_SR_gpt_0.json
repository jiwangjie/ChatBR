{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port='1' in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, the service works as expected and shuts down successfully. However, an error message is printed during the shutdown process.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken up by a notifyAll() call, or use the interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Configure the server.xml file to include <Server port='1'>.\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service.\n3. Attempt to shut down the Tomcat service.\n4. Observe the error message being printed during the shutdown process."}
