Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.To reproduce:1. The first instance starts successfully. ", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80). This issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that was applied in r957960. The second instance fails, but not in the expected way. Instead of throwing an exception, the connector does not attempt to bind to the port until start() is called. The startup sequence then continues and eventually fails in Server.await().", "EB": "Expect the connectors to bind to their ports in Catalina.load() instead of waiting until start() is called.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1.
