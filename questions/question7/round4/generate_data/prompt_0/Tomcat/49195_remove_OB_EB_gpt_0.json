It appears that the error message is misleading, as the shutdown process seems to work correctly. This behavior may also be present in jsvc, but further testing is needed to confirm.", "OB": "When stopping the Tomcat service on Windows after specifying port 1 in the server.xml file, an error message is displayed in the console. However, the service is actually stopped successfully and there are no noticeable issues in the functioning of the software.", "EB": "When stopping the Tomcat service on Windows after specifying port 1 in the server.xml file, no error message should be displayed. The service should be stopped smoothly without any hiccups or misleading notifications.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Observe the error message printed in the console.\n\nNote: The issue may also be reproducible when shutting down the server through an OS signal, such as by calling Catalina.stop(). However, further testing is recommended to confirm this."}
