{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load() bug", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well.In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started.IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.To reproduce:1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "Currently, Connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method but only later in the start() method.", "EB": "I would expect that in the StandardServiceinitInternal() method, the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() is caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalinaload() and rethrown as an Error, which will abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Start the first instance successfully."}
