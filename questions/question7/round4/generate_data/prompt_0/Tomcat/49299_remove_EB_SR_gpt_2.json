{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Incorrect behavior in Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 regarding custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application sets a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter when the session id is encoded in the URL, as long as URL rewriting is enabled. However, the actual result differs from the expected behavior. The attached file (cookiename.war) demonstrates the issue.", "OB": "The page sets a session tracking cookie with the name MYSESSIONCOOKIE. However, when the 'Reload' link on the page is clicked, the URL that is generated uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "The 'Reload' link on the page should use the custom cookie name in the generated URL instead of 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Deploy the attached WAR file (cookiename.war).\n2. Access the application's index.jsp page.\n3. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page.\n4. Observe the URL generated and see that it uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name."}
