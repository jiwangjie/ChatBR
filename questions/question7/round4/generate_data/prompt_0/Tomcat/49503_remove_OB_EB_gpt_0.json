Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "Connectors do not bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() phase, but only later during the start() phase.", "EB": "Connectors should bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() phase and be ready for use during the start() phase.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time. \n2. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXIT_ON_INIT_FAILURE=true."}
