That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log file: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nDespite this error message, Tomcat actually stops after printing it. The Catalina stopServer() function executes System.exit(1) which successfully shuts down Tomcat. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
