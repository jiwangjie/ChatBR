I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat prints an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Despite the error message, Tomcat actually stops after printing it. It is worth noting that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
