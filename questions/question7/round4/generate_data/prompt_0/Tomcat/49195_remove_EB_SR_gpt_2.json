That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service in Tomcat, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message states: \"No shutdown port configured.

Server not shut down.\" should not be printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. Tomcat should be stopped without any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml configuration file.\n2. Start the Windows service for Tomcat.\n3.
