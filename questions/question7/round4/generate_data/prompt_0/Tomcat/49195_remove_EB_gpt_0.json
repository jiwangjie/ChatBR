{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. It is also suggested that jsvc may show the same behavior, but it has not been tested.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nHowever, despite the error message, Tomcat still shuts down correctly. After the error message is printed, Catalina.stopServer() calls System.exit(1) to shut down Tomcat. It is observed that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service. Tomcat should shut down gracefully without displaying any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
