However, when accessing the page, the cookie is set with a different name (MYSESSIONCOOKIE), and the Reload link on the page uses the default name (jsessionid) in the URL.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL, in accordance with the Servlet 3.0 specification.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Deploy the attached war file (cookiename.war).\n2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/."}
