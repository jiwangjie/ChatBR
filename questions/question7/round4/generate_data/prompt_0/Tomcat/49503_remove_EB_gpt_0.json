{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (80). The second instance fails to start because the connector does not try to bind to the port. The startup sequence then continues and fails in Server.await().", "EB": "Connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load() and not wait until later in start().", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
