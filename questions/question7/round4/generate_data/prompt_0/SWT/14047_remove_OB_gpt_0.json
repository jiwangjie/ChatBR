These redraws are excessive and can negatively impact performance.", "EB": "To improve performance and efficiency, there should be a maximum of one redraw for each visible line during text changes with word wrap.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue and observe multiple redraws occurring, add the following line to the `StyledText.performPaint` method: `System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);`"}
