{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from previous searches and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The software should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history and should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. The software should also respect the case of what the user types.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Open a document so that the 'Edit > Find/Replace...' option becomes available.\n2. Choose 'Edit > Find/Replace...'\n3. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n4. Click 'Find'.\n5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."}
