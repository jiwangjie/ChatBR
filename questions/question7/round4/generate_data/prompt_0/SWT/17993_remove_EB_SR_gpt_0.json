{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "The behavior of the Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build is causing issues. Currently, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search history. If a match is found, it replaces what the user has typed with the value from the history. The search is case-insensitive, which means the case of the user's input may be changed to match the case of a value in the history. This can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios. It would be better if the software did not replace the user's typed entry with a value from the history.", "OB": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches the history for a matching entry. If found, it overrides the user's typed entry with the value from the history, even changing the case of the input to match the case in the history.", "EB": "When using the Find/Replace dialog, the software should not replace the user's typed entry with a value from the search history. The user's input should remain intact, regardless of any matches found in the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software and navigate to the Find/Replace dialog through the 'Edit' menu.\n2. Type a unique query in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.\n3. Perform a search or replace operation.\n4. Observe if the software overrides your typed entry with a value from the search history, changing the case if necessary."}
