However, this usage is problematic as it throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This causes issues in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, a private constructor can be added to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in the class, it would be beneficial to make the constructor private to prevent unnecessary instantiation. This change will not add any additional size to the class, as the compiler generates a free public constructor by default.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use the CLDC version of SWT and verify or use jxeLink or a similar tool. This will cause the NoClassDefFoundError to be thrown when the BidiUtil class is instantiated."}
