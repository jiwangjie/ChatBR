{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog, accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace..., has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds a match, it replaces the user's typed entry with the value from the history. The search is case-insensitive, which means that the case of the user's input may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The current behavior of Find/Replace, where it replaces the typed entry with a value from the history, should be changed. The desired behavior should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. In the meantime, until the behavior is changed, it would be preferable to have the feature removed altogether.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document so that the Edit -> Find/Replace... option becomes available. 2. Type something in the 'Find' field. 3. Notice that the typed entry may be replaced with a value from the history. This behavior is also observed in the 'Replace With' field."}
