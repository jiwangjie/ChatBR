{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787[Properties dialog] Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "Integration build 09/17. Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, identifying them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. Instead, it should use a more appropriate UI element that does not visually resemble user input targets and has a consistent background color across different platforms.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Select a Project. 2. Right-click and choose Properties. 3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (e.g., Path, Type) that use text fields."}
