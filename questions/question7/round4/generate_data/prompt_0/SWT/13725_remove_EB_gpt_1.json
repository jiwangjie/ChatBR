{"id": "13725", "title": "Bug 13725: Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "description": "Bug 13725: Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "OB": "When I double click on a file in the navigator to reopen it, it takes about 8 seconds for the window to show the contents of the file. However, if I select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor after performing the same steps, it takes 15 seconds for the window to replace the contents with the original.", "EB": "I expect the 'Revert' operation to have similar or comparable performance to closing and reopening the file in the editor. It should not take significantly longer.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' source folder in the 'org.eclipse.swt' project.\n2. Make changes to the file so that it becomes dirty (e.g., add a space character at the end of the first line).\n3. Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n4. When prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, select 'no'.\n5. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n6. Repeat steps 1-5, but this time select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n\nNote: The observed issue may vary depending on the speed of the machine or system performance."}
