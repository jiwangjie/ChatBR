Users can move the scrollbars around, but they have no effect on the image displayed. This behavior is consistent even when opening a small image, such as an icon. The existence of the scrollbars is misleading as they do not serve any purpose.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled when viewing small images, as they do not serve any purpose in this scenario.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only).\n2. Launch the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved.\n4. Attempt to scroll the image using the scrollbars.\n5. Notice that the scrollbars do not have any effect on the image, even when opening a small image like an icon."}
