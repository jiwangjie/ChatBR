{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "In the ImageAnalyzer example, scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect. When opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they do not have any functionality.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled when viewing small images, as they do not serve any purpose in this scenario.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Build and launch version F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved.\n4. Open a small image, like an icon.\n5. Observe that the scrollbars are present but do not have any effect."}
