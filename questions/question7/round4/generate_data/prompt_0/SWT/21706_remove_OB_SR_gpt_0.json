{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 module uses Class.forName() method, which is problematic because there are no non-static methods in this class, so there is no need to instantiate it.", "EB": "To address this issue, a private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class. This will prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class and improve code quality. Additionally, making the constructor private will not increase the size of the compiled code as the compiler provides a free public constructor by default.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 module.\n2. Look for usages of Class.forName() method."}
