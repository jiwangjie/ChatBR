Looks bad on all motif platforms. ", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, indicating them as input fields. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should be created as readonly Text fields instead of Labels. This change would prevent the automatic borders on motif platforms and remove the different colored backgrounds on Solaris/AIX/HPUX. It is likely that the fields are currently implemented as text fields to allow users to select and copy their values.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Properties dialog for a project. \n2. Navigate to the Info page. \n3. Observe the appearance of the text fields on motif platforms and the different colored backgrounds on Solaris/AIX/HPUX."}
