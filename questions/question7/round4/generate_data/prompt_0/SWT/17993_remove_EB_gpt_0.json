{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit->Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace what the user has typed with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to search for exactly what they have typed and perform the find or replace operation as intended.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use the F1 build. \n2. Open the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit->Find/Replace...). \n3. Note the history of recent searches. \n4. Type 'hello' into the Find field and replace it with 'hi'. \n5. Perform a search using the Find button. \n6. Try to type 'Hello' into the Find field. \n7. Observe that it gets replaced with 'hi' from the history instead of allowing you to search for 'Hello'."}
