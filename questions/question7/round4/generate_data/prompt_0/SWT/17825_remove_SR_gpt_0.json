Somehow I don't think it's supposed to do that.", "OB": "When selecting SWT.MULTI in the ControlExampleText, the application emits a bell sound. Additionally, clicking on other buttons also triggers the bell sound.", "EB": "I expect that selecting SWT.MULTI in the ControlExampleText should not produce any sound. It should function as intended without emitting a bell sound when other buttons are clicked.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Launch the application.\n2. Access the ControlExampleText.\n3. Select the option for SWT.MULTI.\n4. Click on various buttons in the application."}
