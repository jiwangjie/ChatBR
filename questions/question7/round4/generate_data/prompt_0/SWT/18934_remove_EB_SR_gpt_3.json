When opening the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars appear to be enabled. However, despite being movable, they have no effect on the displayed image. Notably, when opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading as they do not perform any functional scrolling.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled, particularly when their use has no impact on the displayed image. Users should not be misled by non-functional scrollbars, especially when dealing with small images.", "SR": "1. Launch the application using Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2.10 (GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Observe the enabled scrollbars that do not have any effect, even when interacting with small images like icons."}
