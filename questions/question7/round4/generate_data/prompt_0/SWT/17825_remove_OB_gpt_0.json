Somehow, I don't think it's supposed to do that.", "OB": "When selecting SWT.MULTI in the SWT example ControlExample under the Text tab, the system emits a Windows 'ding' sound, indicating that something went wrong.", "EB": "I expected that no sound would be emitted when choosing SWT.MULTI in the ControlExample. It should not produce a 'ding' sound.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the SWT example ControlExample (Build F1, 20020521) on Win2K. \n2. Go to the Text tab. \n3. Click on StylesSWT.SINGLE. \n4. Click back on StylesSWT.MULTI. \n   The 'ding' sound should be heard when performing these steps."}
