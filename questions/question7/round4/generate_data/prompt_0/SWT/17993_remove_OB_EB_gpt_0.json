{"id": "17993", "title": "Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "When performing a find or replace operation, the software should not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Currently, the behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is commonly seen in browsers. However, it would be preferable if the software provided a full autocomplete feature in the future.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from previous searches and automatically replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The software should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to manually enter the desired text without interference.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Choose 'Edit' -> 'Find/Replace...' \n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field. \n3. Click 'Find'. \n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field, but notice that it is automatically replaced with a value from the history."}
