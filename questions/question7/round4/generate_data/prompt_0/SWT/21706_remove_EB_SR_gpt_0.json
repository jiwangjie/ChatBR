However, when this line of code is executed, it throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This causes a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. It is important to note that this issue may only be visible when using jxeLink or similar tools, as the compiler assumes that NoClassDefFoundError is available and does not generate a compiler error.", "EB": "The usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class should be changed to remove the reflection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Enable jxeLink or a similar tool.\n3. Execute the application and observe the NoClassDefFoundError in the BidiUtil class."}
