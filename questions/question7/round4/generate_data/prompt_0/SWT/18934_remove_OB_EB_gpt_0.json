{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "When using the ImageAnalyzer example, scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect. This can be misleading when opening a small image such as an icon, as the scrollbars do not actually do anything.", "OB": "Scrollbars are enabled in the ImageAnalyzer example, but they do not have any effect when moved.", "EB": "Scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled to prevent confusion and provide a more accurate representation of the image size.", "SR": "1. Build F2 (20020602)\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved.\n4. Open a small image, such as an icon.\n5. Observe that the scrollbars do not have any effect when moved."}
