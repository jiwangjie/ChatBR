This is significantly slower compared to the 'Close' and 'Reopen' operations, which take only 8 seconds to complete.", "EB": "The 'Revert' operation should not take longer than the 'Close' and 'Reopen' operations. The time taken to replace the contents of the window with the original should be similar or shorter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Open the Java editor on the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3) Perform the 'Revert' operation by selecting it from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n\nNote: Ensure that the time taken to complete the 'Revert' operation is longer compared to the 'Close' and 'Reopen' operations."}
