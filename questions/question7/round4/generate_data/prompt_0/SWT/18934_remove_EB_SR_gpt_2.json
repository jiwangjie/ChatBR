{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars appear to be enabled. However, they have no effect when moved. This behavior is misleading, especially when opening a small image such as an icon, as the scrollbars do not serve any purpose.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example. 2. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled. 3. Try moving them and notice that they have no effect. 4. Open a small image such as an icon and observe that the scrollbars are still present but do not function."}
