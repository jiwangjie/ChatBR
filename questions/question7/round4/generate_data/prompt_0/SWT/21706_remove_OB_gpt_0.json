Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it would be a good practice to make the constructor private. This will prevent people from instantiating the class if there's no need to. Making the constructor private will not add any size, as the compiler provides a free public constructor anyway. It simply changes the accessibility of the constructor from public to private.", "SR": "To make the constructor private, change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);\nNote that this change has not been tested, but it is expected to have the same effect as the original code."}
