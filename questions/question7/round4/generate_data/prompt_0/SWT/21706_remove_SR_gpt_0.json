However, this usage of Class.forName() causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "The line of code that uses Class.forName() should be removed and replaced with a private constructor for the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, making the constructor private will prevent unnecessary instantiation.", "SR": ""}
