{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved around. However, they do not have any effect. Even when opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars remain misleading because they do not provide any functionality.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved around.\n4. Notice that the scrollbars do not have any effect on the displayed image.\n5. For further confirmation, open a small image, like an icon, and observe that the scrollbars still do not provide any functionality."}
