{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the text widget and the tree widget are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. It is possible to work around this issue by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This behavior causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when you click anywhere in the tree, the tree should get focus, and the text widget should lose focus accordingly, regardless of the operating system.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the application. 2. Click anywhere in the tree widget. 3. Observe that the tree widget gains focus and the text widget does not lose focus on Linux."}
