{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the user clicks on the tree, the focus should be transferred to the tree, and the text widget should lose focus.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the application with both the tree and text widget visible. \n2. Click anywhere in the tree widget. \n3. Observe that the tree gains focus, while the text widget still retains focus."}
