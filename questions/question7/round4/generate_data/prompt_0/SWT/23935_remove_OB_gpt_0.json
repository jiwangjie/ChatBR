{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "On Windows, when clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree retains focus and does not lose it to the text widget.", "EB": "When running build 20020920 and clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree should lose focus and the text widget should gain focus.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Click anywhere in the tree widget. Observe that the tree retains focus instead of losing it. "}
