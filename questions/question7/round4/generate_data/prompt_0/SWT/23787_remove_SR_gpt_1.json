Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields on the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them appear as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The text fields on the Project Properties Info page should be created as readonly Text fields instead of using labels. This would prevent the automatic borders and different colored backgrounds. It is suggested that this change may improve the appearance on motif platforms.", "SR": ""}
