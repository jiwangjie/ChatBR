{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "The Find/Replace feature is replacing the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. It should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. The feature should still respect the case of what the user types.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document so that Edit > Find/Replace... becomes available. 2. Type an entry in the Find field. 3. Observe that the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history. The same behavior can be observed for the Replace With field."}
