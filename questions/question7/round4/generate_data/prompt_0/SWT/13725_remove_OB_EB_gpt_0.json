However, selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "The 'Revert' functionality in the java editor should perform as efficiently as the close and reopen method, taking approximately 8 seconds instead of 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open an editor on the fileorg.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open-source repository.\n2. Select the end of the first line and insert a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3. Click on the close box in the editor tab and answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n4. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n\nObserve the time it takes to perform the above steps.\n\nRepeat steps 1 and 2, but instead of closing and reopening, select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor and observe the time it takes to replace the contents of the window with the original."}
