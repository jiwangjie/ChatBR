We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "On Windows, when the Text widget is a child of the Tree widget, it does not lose focus as expected.", "EB": "On build 20020920, the Text widget should lose focus when it is a child of the Tree widget on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "1. Open the attached code.\n2. Run the code.\n3. On Windows, observe the behavior of the left tree and text to see how they should behave. Try to interact with them and see how the focus changes.\n4. On Linux, observe the behavior of the left tree and text to see how they should behave. Try to interact with them and see how the focus changes."}
