Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB(Observed Behavior), EB(Expected Behavior), and SR(Steps to Reproduce) sections.  In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.  Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:
{"id": "", "title": "", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '121323', 'title': 'Bug 121323XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information', 'description': '', 'OB': '', 'EB': "Why can't we use the plain XPath expression (of course prependedwith the path from the data set selector itself) and let filtering be somethingfor those which need it?Kind regards,Herbert ", 'SR': "If one enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selectionpart like section[@id='left'] then within class RelationInformation theselection is stripped of and stored in filterInfo HashMap.When leaving the dialog, RelationInformation gets persited to .rptdesignbutdata stored in filterInfo is lost.HoweverIMHO treating XPath expressions in that way will lead to a lotof trouble.
