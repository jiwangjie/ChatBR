Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
It is possible that the bug report may lack sufficient details in the OB(Observed Behavior), EB(Expected Behavior), and SR(Steps to Reproduce) sections.  In such cases, your task is to infer the appropriate details based on the context and supplement the bug report to ensure it contains clear and complete OB/EB/SR statements.  Also, improve the wording of these statements for clarity where possible.
To facilitate this process, please provide your responses in JSON format as follows:

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '49503', 'title': 'Bug 49503Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()', 'description': 'Bug 49503Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start() Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well.In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started.IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.To reproduce:1. The first instance starts successfully. ', 'OB': '', 'EB': 'Expected behaviour:I would expect that in StandardServiceinitInternal() the connector.init() call fails, because it cannot bind to the port.The exception from connector.init() is caught there and, if EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown, then caught in Catalinaload() and then rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.4.
