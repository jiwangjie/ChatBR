{'id': '17993', 'title': "Bug 17993Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", 'description': 'It wouldbe better if what I type isn\'t replaced with a value from the history.The current behaviour seems to be similar to "autocomplete" which isparticularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full "autocomplete"feature could be provided. ', 'OB': 'I\'m using the F1 build.The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through EditFind/Replace...) has a historyof recent searches. When you type in the "Find" or "Replace With" fields itsearches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces whatyou have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history iscase insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may bechanged to the case of the value in the history.In some scenarios this makes it impossible to perform find or replaceoperations.
