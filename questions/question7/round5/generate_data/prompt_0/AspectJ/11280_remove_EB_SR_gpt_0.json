{"id": "11280", "title": "Bug 11280[View Mgmt] Switching perspectives loses view maximized state", "description": "", "OB": "When switching perspectives in the software, the maximized state of the view is lost. This means that if a user maximizes a view in one perspective and then switches to another perspective, the view is no longer maximized.", "EB": "The software should retain the maximized state of the view when switching perspectives. The view that was maximized in one perspective should stay maximized when switching to another perspective.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the software and switch to the first perspective.\n2. Maximize any view in the first perspective.\n3. Switch to a different perspective.\n4. Notice that the previously maximized view is not maximized anymore."}
