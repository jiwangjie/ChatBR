See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed in the form 'app/Main.class' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.\n2. Observe that the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'."}
