This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\n   You will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nNo big deal, really.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nBut it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac."}
