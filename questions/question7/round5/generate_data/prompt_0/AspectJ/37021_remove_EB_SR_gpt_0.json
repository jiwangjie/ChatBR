See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it).", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. I have also seen the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed in the form 'app/Main.class' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Run the code from tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Observe the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.\n3. Notice that the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
