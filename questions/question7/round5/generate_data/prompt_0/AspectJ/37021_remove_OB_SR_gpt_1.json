The current form of the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Navigate to the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings' directory.\n2. Run the code in that directory to observe the problem.\n\nNote: These tests have some limitations. They may return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. In some cases, if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
