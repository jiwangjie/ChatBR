However, it is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. It seems that the expected behavior should be to generate a valid jar file with the MANIFEST.MF file included.", "OB": "When using ajc with the sourceroots, outjar, and a specified jarfile options, a jar file is created. However, the created jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, making it invalid.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when using the outjar option, ajc should generate a jar file that contains a valid MANIFEST.MF file, complying with the JAR file specifications.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run the ajc command with the sourceroots, outjar, and a specified jarfile options.\n2. Check the generated jar file and observe that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
