This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n  }\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command:\n\najc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. subpackage\\Test.java or javac subpackage\\Test.java.\n\nNo big deal, really.", "OB": "When compiling classes from a subpackage using ajc without the -d option, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "But it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac, where a directory named \"subpackage\" is not created.", "SR": "Use the -d option while correctly compiling classes from the subpackage."}
