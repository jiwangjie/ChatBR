This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nCreate a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n   }\n\n}\nThen compile using the following command: ajc -d subpackage\\ Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\n\n\n", "OB": "When compiling a class in a subpackage using ajc without the -d option, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for ajc to have the same behavior as javac and correctly compile the classes from the subpackage without creating an additional \"subpackage\" directory.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile the class using the command: ajc -d subpackage\\ Test.java.\n3. Verify that the class is compiled correctly and that no additional \"subpackage\" directory is created."}
