Call 'ajc' with the 'sourceroots' option followed by the source directory.\n2. Use the 'outjar' option followed by the desired JAR file name (e.g., <my.jar>).\n3. Verify that an output file is created with a .jar extension.\n4. Check the contents of the JAR file and confirm that it includes a MANIFEST.MF file."}
