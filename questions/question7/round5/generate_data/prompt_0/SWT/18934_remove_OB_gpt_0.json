{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled. However, when attempting to use the scrollbars by moving them, they have no effect. This issue is observed even when opening a small image like an icon, rendering the scrollbars misleading.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled to prevent users from attempting to use them, as they currently have no effect on the displayed image.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2 (GTK2 only). 2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example. 3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect on the displayed image, even when opening a small image like an icon."}
