{"id": "14047", "title": "Bug 14047: StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap", "description": "", "OB": "When making changes to the text in StyledText with word wrap enabled, the software performs multiple redraws for each visible line, causing inefficient rendering.", "EB": "This behavior should be optimized so that there is at a maximum only one redraw for each visible line during text changes with word wrap.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Add the following line of code to the 'performPaint' function in the StyledText module: System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);\n2. Run the test case and observe the redraws occurring during text changes with word wrap."}
