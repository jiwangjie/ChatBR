{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the text widget and the tree widget are children of the shell. The issue is only observed on Windows. A possible workaround is to create the text editor as a sibling of the tree and position it above the tree.", "OB": "When the code attached to the bug report is run, the text widget does not lose focus when interacting with the tree widget. This behavior is observed on Windows.", "EB": "When the code attached to the bug report is run, the text widget should lose focus when interacting with the tree widget. This is the expected behavior on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Compile and run the attached code on Windows.\n2. Interact with the tree widget while the text widget has focus.\n3. Note that the text widget does not lose focus as expected."}
