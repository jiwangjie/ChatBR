{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "The ImageAnalyzer example in the software currently displays scrollbars even when they are not needed. This is causing a cosmetic issue and making the user interface look cluttered.", "EB": "The ImageAnalyzer example should disable the display of scrollbars when they are not needed. This will improve the appearance and user experience of the software.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the ImageAnalyzer example. \n2. Resize the window to a smaller size so that the image fits within the available space. \n3. Observe that scrollbars appear on the side of the image even though they are not required. \n\nNote: The issue may not be reproducible if the window size is large enough to accommodate the image without the need for scrollbars."}
