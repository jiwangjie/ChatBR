I need to first click on one of the 'live' areas before it starts working (e.g., the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame.", "OB": "When I try to use the Help view, it does not start working until I manually click on one of the 'live' areas, such as the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame.", "EB": "We should be starting the Help view in a way that allows immediate keyboard navigation without requiring the user to click on any 'live' areas.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Help view.\n2. Try navigating through the view using only the keyboard.\n3. Notice that the navigation does not work until you click on one of the 'live' areas.
