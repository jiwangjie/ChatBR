{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history. This behavior resembles autocomplete, commonly seen in browsers. However, it would be better if the software does not replace what is typed with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software replaces what is typed with a value from the history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software should not replace what is typed with a value from the history. It should allow the user to enter their own text without interference from previous search history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the software and go to the 'Find/Replace' feature. 2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field. 3. Click 'Find'. 4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field and observe the behavior."}
