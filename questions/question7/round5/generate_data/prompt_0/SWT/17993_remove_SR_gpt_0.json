{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the software is currently replacing the typed entry with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in web browsers, but it can prevent users from performing accurate find and replace operations. The bug report suggests that a full autocomplete feature may be implemented in the future. However, in the meantime, the current behavior should be changed to allow users to perform a complete range of find and replace operations while still respecting the case of the typed entry. If this change is not possible, the report suggests that the feature should be removed.", "OB": "In the F1 build of the software, the Find/Replace dialog, accessed through Edit > Find/Replace..., has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from previous searches. If it finds a matching entry, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, which means that the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform accurate find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The software's Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, users should be able to perform a complete range of find and replace operations while still respecting the case of the typed entry. To achieve this, the current behavior needs to be changed. Alternatively, if implementing this change is not possible, the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document in the software. \n2. Access the Find/Replace dialog through Edit > Find/Replace... \n3. Type something in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields. \n4. Observe if the software replaces the typed entry with a value from the history. \n\nThe same behavior can be tested for the 'Replace With' field as well."}
