{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, if I type an entry in the Find field or the Replace field, it gets replaced with a value from the history or suggestion list.", "EB": "Find/Replace shouldn't replace the typed entry with a value from the history or suggestion list. The behavior should allow users to perform a full range of find and replace operations while respecting the case of what the user types.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Access the 'Edit' menu.\n3. Click on 'Find/Replace...' to open the Find/Replace dialog box.\n4. Type an entry in the 'Find' field or the 'Replace' field.\n5. Observe that the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history or suggestion list."}
