{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the system searches for entries from previous searches and automatically replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The behavior of Find/Replace should be changed to something more simple, allowing the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open a document. 2. Ensure that Edit > Find/Replace... becomes available. 3. Type 'hello' in the Find field and replace it with 'hi'. 4. Search for 'Hello' and try to replace it with 'Hi'."}
