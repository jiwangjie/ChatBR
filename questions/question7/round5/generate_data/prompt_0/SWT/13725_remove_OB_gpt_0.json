This is observed after selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.", "EB": "It is expected that reverting the file contents should not take more time than closing and reopening the file. The 'Revert' action should be faster or at least as fast as the 'Close' and 'Reopen' actions.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1) Open an editor on the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3) Perform the following steps:\n   - Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n   - Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n   - Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n\nObserve that the 'Revert' action takes significantly longer (approximately 15 seconds) to replace the contents of the window with the original compared to the 'Close' and 'Reopen' actions (approximately 8 seconds)."}
