{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved around. However, they do not have any effect. Even when opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they do not perform any actions.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled to prevent confusion and indicate that they do not have any functional purpose.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example in build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only). 2. Navigate to a small image, such as an icon. 3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect."}
