{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect. This behavior is observed even when opening a small image, such as an icon. The scrollbars are misleading because they do not perform any function.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Build F2 (20020602)\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but have no effect\n4. Try opening a small image, like an icon, and notice that the scrollbars still do not perform any function."}
