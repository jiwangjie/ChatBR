However, this usage of reflection causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT. Although this issue may not be apparent when using the eclipse compiler or Sun's compiler, it poses a problem when verifying or using jxeLink. The aim is to remove the reflection in order to resolve the issue.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Verify or use jxeLink.\n3.
