{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the software has a behavior where the typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields is replaced with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to an 'autocomplete' feature commonly found in web browsers. However, this can be problematic in certain scenarios, making it impossible to perform find or replace operations. It would be better if what is typed is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be considered.", "OB": "When using the F1 build, the Find/Replace dialog can be accessed through the 'Edit' menu, specifically 'Find/Replace...'. The dialog displays a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from previous searches and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, resulting in a potential change in the case of the typed entry to match the value from the history.", "EB": "It is expected that the software does not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history in the Find/Replace dialog. The case of the typed entry should remain as it was originally typed, without being changed to match the case of the value from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the software and navigate to the 'Edit' menu. 2. Select 'Find/Replace...' to open the Find/Replace dialog. 3. In the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field, type a value that is not present in the history. 4. Press Enter or click on any other field within the dialog. 5. Observe if the typed entry is still present or if it has been replaced with a value from the history."}
