Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields on motif platforms. The design should be consistent with the appearance on Windows, where the text fields do not have automatic borders and the backgrounds are not different colored.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Select a Project. \n2. Right-click and choose Properties. \n3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (the values for Path, Type, etc.)"}
