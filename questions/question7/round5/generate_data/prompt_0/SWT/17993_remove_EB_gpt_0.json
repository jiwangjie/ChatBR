{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build is replacing the typed entry with a value from the history, making it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. This behavior is similar to an autocomplete feature commonly found in browsers. However, it would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced and a full autocomplete feature could be considered for future improvements.", "OB": "In the Find/Replace dialog accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace, there is a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds a match, it replaces the current typed entry with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to enter their desired search or replacement without interference from the history. The history should only be used for suggestions or as a reference, but not as an automatic replacement mechanism.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the software and navigate to Edit -> Find/Replace. 2. Type 'a' into the Find field. 3. Click 'Find'. 4. Now, try to type 'A' into the Find field. Observe that the typed entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history matching the case."}
