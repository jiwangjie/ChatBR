We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree does not lose focus.", "EB": "In build 20020920, the attached code should ensure that when clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree should lose focus.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, click anywhere in the tree and observe that the tree does not lose focus."}
