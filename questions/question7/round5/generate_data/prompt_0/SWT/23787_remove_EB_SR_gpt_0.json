Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them stand out as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which further exacerbates the issue.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog should not use text fields. Instead, a different user interface element or styling should be used to present the information. This change will ensure consistency and improve the overall appearance on motif platforms.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Properties dialog. \n2. Navigate to the Project Properties Info page. \n3. Observe the appearance of the text fields on motif platforms."}
