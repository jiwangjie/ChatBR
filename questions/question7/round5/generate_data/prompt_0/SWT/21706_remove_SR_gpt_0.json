This line of code is causing a NoClassDefFoundError when using the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, making the constructor private would be beneficial. This change would prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use the CLDC version of SWT that utilizes the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class."}
