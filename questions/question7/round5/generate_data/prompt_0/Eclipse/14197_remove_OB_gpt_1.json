This refiltering occurs immediately upon deletion, rather than when closing the working set selection dialog.", "EB": "The package view should only refilter when closing the working set selection dialog, not when deleting a working set. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to working sets, including canceling the removal of a working set.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Create a working set with one project and select it. The package view should be filtered.\n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set. Delete the first working set."}
