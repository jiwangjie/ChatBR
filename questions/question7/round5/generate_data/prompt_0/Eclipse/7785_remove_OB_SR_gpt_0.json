{"id": "7785", "title": "Bug 7785: SaveAs Forgets the file type", "description": "Bug 7785: SaveAs Forgets the file type. The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When using the SaveAs function, the file is saved with a generic file icon and without any file extension. When the file is opened, it is treated as a text file.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file, unless explicitly changed. The file should retain the parent java file icon.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a java file in the application.\n2. Use the 'SaveAs' function to save the file.\n3. Check the file icon and the file extension of the saved file."}
