The file remains open in its current editor.", "EB": "When trying to open a file with a different type of editor in the editor management system, if the file is already open, a new editor should be opened for the file based on the selected editor type.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml' within the project.\n3. The default editor used for XML files is the scripted resource editor example.\n4. Open 'test.xml' in the editor.\n5. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'.\n6. Choose 'Open With...' / 'Default Text Editor'.\n7. Notice that nothing happens and the file remains open in the scripted resource editor example.\n\nExpected result:\nAfter step 7, a new editor should be opened for 'test.xml' using the default text editor, because the editor type is different."}
