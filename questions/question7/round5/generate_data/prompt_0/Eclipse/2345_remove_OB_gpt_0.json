It does not open a new editor for the file.", "EB": "When selecting 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' for a file that is already open in a different type of editor, a new editor should be opened for the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the scripted resource editor example. 2. Create a new basic project. 3. Create a new file named 'test.xml'. 4. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'. 5. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'. The expected behavior is that a new editor should be opened for the file, disregarding the fact that the file is already open in a different editor type."}
