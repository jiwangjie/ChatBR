However, this doesn't always meet user expectations.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters, since the end product is a Unix product. A UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and default platform line delimiter. The UI should be consistent across all plugins to ensure the same line delimiter is used for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Verify that the line delimiter used is the one returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\").\n4. Verify that there is no UI option to define the line delimiter for new files."}
