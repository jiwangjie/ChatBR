When a string in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be clipped and not visible within the property sheet.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet view. \n2. Edit an object using the name-value pairs displayed in the property sheet. \n3. Ensure that column two contains a combo box editor. \n4. Make one of the strings in the combo box wider than the width of the property sheet column. \n5. Observe that the combo box expands to fit the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be clipped and not visible. "}
