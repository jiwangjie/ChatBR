This behavior is not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000. The movement of these icons can confuse users.", "EB": "The close button should stay in its position and not move down when the view is resized smaller.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the application on a Linux machine with build 20011127.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n4. Observe the close button moving down below the label."}
