{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. As a result, the drop down button may be positioned too far to the right, outside the visible area of the property sheet. This causes the drop down button to be clipped and users cannot see it without widening the property sheet view.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should resize properly so that the drop down button is always visible within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor's dropdown list.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit objects using a set of rows that contain name-value pairs displayed in two columns.\n3. Ensure that the IPropertyDescriptor method to create a cell editor is used to create ComboBoxCellEditor.\n4. Set some strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor's dropdown list that are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not resize correctly, causing the drop down button to be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet and get clipped."}
