Users expect the close button to be on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the Navigator view on linux with build 20011127. 2. Resize the view to a smaller size. 3. Observe that the tool items (pulldown menu icon and close icon) move below the label."}
