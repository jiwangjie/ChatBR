It does not have the same width as the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as DialogCellEditor (Button always visible). I will need to investigate to determine if this issue is caused by us or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Locate the column with the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the combo box does not have the same width as the property sheet column."}
