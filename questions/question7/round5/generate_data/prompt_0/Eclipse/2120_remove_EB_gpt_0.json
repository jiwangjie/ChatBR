This means that when files are opened and the workbench is shut down, the files do not appear in the MRU list when the workbench is restarted.", "EB": "The MRU file list should be persisted between sessions. Even if the workbench is shut down and restarted, the files that were previously opened should still appear in the MRU list in the File menu.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Start the workbench. 2. Open 2 or 3 files. 3. Shutdown the workbench. 4. Restart the workbench and observe the File menu MRU list."}
