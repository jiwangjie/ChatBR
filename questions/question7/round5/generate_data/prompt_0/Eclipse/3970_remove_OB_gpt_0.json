There should be a UI (Preferences) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario: Use both Unix and Windows work stations to develop a Unix product/program in Eclipse."}
