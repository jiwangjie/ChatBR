{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, a problem occurs with the ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet. If any of the strings in the drop-down menu is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item. However, the drop-down button may now be positioned too far to the right and be clipped off the visible area of the property sheet. As a result, users cannot see the drop-down button without widening the property sheet view.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column, ensuring that the drop-down button is visible in the property sheet view.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Use the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects.\n2. Configure column two of the property sheet to include ComboBoxCellEditor with strings, some of which are wider than the column width.\n3. Observe that the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item, but the drop-down button may be clipped off the visible area of the property sheet."}
