", "OB": "When using the ComboBoxCellEditor in a property sheet, it does not size correctly.", "EB": "I would expect the ComboBoxCellEditor to always be the same width as the property sheet column. Currently, it does not match the behavior of DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. It is unclear if this issue is caused by our code or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet \n2. Select a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor \n3. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly"}
