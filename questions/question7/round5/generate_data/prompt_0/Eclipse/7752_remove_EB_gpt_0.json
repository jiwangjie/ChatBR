Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt').\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and choose 'Zip File' option to export.\n4.

The error message indicates that there were problems encountered during the export process, and it specifically points out the file with the same name in project 2 as the cause of the issue.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the export process to successfully create a zip file containing all selected files, regardless of whether they share the same name but reside in different directories.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
