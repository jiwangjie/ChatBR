{"id": "7581", "title": "ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly when any of the strings in the drop-down list are wider than the width of the property sheet column. The combo box grows to be the width of the largest item, causing the drop-down button to be positioned too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in it being clipped.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size itself based on the available width of the property sheet column, ensuring that the drop-down button remains visible even when the strings in the drop-down list are wider than the column.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet view. \n2. Navigate to a property that uses a ComboBoxCellEditor as its cell editor. \n3. Ensure that the strings in the drop-down list are wider than the width of the property sheet column. \n4. Observe that the drop-down button is positioned too far right and is partially or fully clipped. "}
