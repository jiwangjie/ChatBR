Additionally, pressing cancel does not revert the changes made to the working sets.", "EB": "At the moment of deletion, the package view should not be filtered immediately. Instead, the refiltering should only occur when closing the working set selection dialog. Furthermore, pressing cancel should cancel any changes made to the working sets, including the removal.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the working set selection dialog. 2. Remove a working set. 3. Observe the package view being immediately filtered. 4. Attempt to press cancel and verify that the removal of the working set is not reverted."}
