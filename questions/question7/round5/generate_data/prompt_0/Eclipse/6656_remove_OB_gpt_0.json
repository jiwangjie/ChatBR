{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller on Linux, the tool items move below the label.", "EB": "These two tool items should stay on the same line as the label regardless of the view size. The close button should be located to the far right corner, as users are accustomed to it being on the same line as the label.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the Navigator view on Linux. 2. Resize the view to a smaller size."}
