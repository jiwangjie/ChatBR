No warning or error message is displayed.", "EB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, an error message should be displayed when attempting to open the same file in another editor. The error message should inform the user that the file is already open and they need to close it before opening in another editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Ensure that a file is open in an editor.\n2. Attempt to open the same file in another editor.\n   - Go to the file explorer and double-click on any Java file.\n   - If WordPad or Notepad is set as the default editor for Java files, skip the next step.\n   - Right-click on the Java file, select 'Open With', and choose 'WordPad' or 'Notepad' as the default editor for Java files.\n3. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' \u2192 'System Editor'.\n4. Nothing happens, and no warning or error message is displayed.\n\nExpected result:\n- The workbench should display a warning message indicating that the file is already open and needs to be closed before opening in another editor.\n- Alternatively, an error message should be displayed indicating that the file is already open and cannot be opened in another editor until it is closed."}
