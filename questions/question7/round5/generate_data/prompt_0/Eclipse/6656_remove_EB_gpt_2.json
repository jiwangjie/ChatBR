{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When running build 20011127 on Linux, if a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), move below the label. This behavior is not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000. This movement of the icons can confuse users.", "EB": "These two tool items should stay on the same line as the label regardless of the view size. The close button should be located to the far right corner, as users are accustomed to it being on the same line as the label.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software on Linux with build 20011127.\n2. Resized a view, such as the Navigator, to be smaller.\n3. Observe that the tool items, the pulldown menu icon, and the close icon are moving below the label."}
