Instead, the existing editor for the file is reactivated.", "EB": "When selecting 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' on an already open file, a new editor specifically designed for text content should be opened, instead of reactivating the existing editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the '1GEWMOZ: ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor' example.\n2. Create a new basic project.\n3. Create a new file called 'test.xml'.\n4. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'.\n5. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'.\n\nExpected result:\nA new editor designed for text content should be opened for the file.\n\nNotes:\n- Searching for an existing open file should consider the type of editor.\n- The expected behavior is to open a new editor for the file when the editor type is different from the already open editor."}
