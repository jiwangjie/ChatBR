However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "The software should provide a UI for users to define the default line delimiters for new files, allowing them to specify their preferred line delimiter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Open the software and navigate to the preferences/settings.  \n2. Look for the section or option related to line delimiters.  \n3. Attempt to configure or define the default line delimiters for new files.  \n4. Note that there is no UI or option available to perform this action."}
