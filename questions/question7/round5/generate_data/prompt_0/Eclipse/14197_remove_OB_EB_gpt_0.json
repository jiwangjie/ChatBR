{"id": "14197", "title": "Bug 14197 - Removing a working set immediately triggers changes", "description": "Removing a working set immediately triggers changes in the software.", "OB": "When a working set is removed, the package view is immediately altered, even though it should remain unchanged until the working set dialog is closed.", "EB": "The package view should only be updated when the working set dialog is closed, not immediately upon removing a working set.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a working set with one project and select it in the package view, ensuring that the package view is filtered accordingly.\n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set.\n3. Delete the first working set and observe that the package view is immediately updated, which is unexpected."}
