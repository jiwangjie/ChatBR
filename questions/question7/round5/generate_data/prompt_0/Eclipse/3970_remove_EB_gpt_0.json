However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "We need to provide a user interface that allows the user to define the default line delimiters for new files. This will give the user control over the line delimiter used when creating new files.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Use a Unix or Windows workstation to develop a Unix product/program. 2. Create a new file. 3. Notice that the line delimiter used is determined by System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\")."}
