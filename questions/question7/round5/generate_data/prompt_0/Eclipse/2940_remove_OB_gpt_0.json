It takes a long time (approximately 30 seconds in my case) to update the checked state of the table. The expected behavior is that a busy cursor should be shown.", "OB": "In the Export Zip feature, when updating the checkboxes to reflect the selected projects and file types, no busy cursor is shown and it takes a long time (approximately 30 seconds) for the checkboxes to update.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that a busy cursor should be displayed during the update process, providing visual feedback to the user.

Open a workspace with many projects. \n2. Navigate to the Export Zip feature. \n3. Select all projects. \n4. Choose the desired file types. \n5. Press the OK button to initiate the export process."}
