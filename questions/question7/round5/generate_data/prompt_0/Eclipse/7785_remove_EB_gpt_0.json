The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When performing the following steps:\n1) Open an existing java file\n2) Modify the java file (by moving an existing class)\n3) Click the SaveAs icon (located next to the Save Icon)\n4) A dialog will appear\n5) Browse for a valid container location\n6) Type the filename without specifying the extension\n7) Click the Ok button\n\nThe observed behavior is that the Navigator has added the file in the specified location but without displaying the file extension.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when saving a file using the SaveAs function without specifying the file extension, the system should automatically append the appropriate file extension based on the file type (in this case, '.java'). Additionally, the file icon should remain as the parent java file icon and should not change to a generic file icon.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1) Open an existing java file\n2) Modify the java file (by moving an existing class)\n3) Click the SaveAs icon (located next to the Save Icon)\n4) A dialog will appear\n5) Browse for a valid container location\n6) Type the filename without specifying the extension\n7) Click the Ok button\n\nObserve that the Navigator adds the file in the specified location without displaying the file extension, and the file icon changes from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon."}
