{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120MRU File List is not persisted between sessions (1GE71Z0)", "description": "", "OB": "During testing, it was observed that the MRU (Most Recently Used) file list does not persist between sessions. When files are opened and closed, they appear in the File menu's MRU list. However, when the application is closed and reopened, the files are no longer present in the MRU list.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the MRU file list should be persisted between sessions. When files are opened and closed, they should continue to appear in the File menu's MRU list even after the application is closed and reopened.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Open several files.\n3. Close the files.\n4. Close the application.\n5. Reopen the application.\n6. Check the File menu's MRU list for the previously opened files.\n\nExpected outcome: The previously opened files should still be visible in the MRU list."}
