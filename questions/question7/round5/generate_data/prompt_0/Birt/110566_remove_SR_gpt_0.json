{"id": "110566", "title": "Wrong data set result returned when set an invalid filter expression row[0]", "description": "When setting a filter like \"row[0] equals to 0\" or just returning a null result set, the data set returns incorrect results. The issue occurs when an invalid filter expression involving row[0] is set. According to the developer, row[0] can only be generated after all the data is fetched and cannot be used as a filter expression.", "OB": "When setting a filter in the data set with the expression \"row[0] equals to\", and then clicking on the Preview tab, the first result record is returned.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that row[0] cannot be used as a filter expression and an error message should be displayed to inform the user about this limitation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set a filter in the data set with the expression \"row[0] equals to\"\n2. Click on the Preview tab."}
