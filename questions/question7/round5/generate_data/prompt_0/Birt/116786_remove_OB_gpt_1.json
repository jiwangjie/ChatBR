{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when a library is included in a report design using the BIRT designer, the absolute path is generated and saved. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test and a library is included from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the absolute path to the library is stored instead of a relative path.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. In the given example, the relative path 'otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' should be stored instead of the absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Open a report design located in $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Close and reopen the report design to verify the relative path is still correctly stored."}
