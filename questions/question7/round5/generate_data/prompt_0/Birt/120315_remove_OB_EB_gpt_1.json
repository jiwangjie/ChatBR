The item remains visible.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the display property of an item is set to 'none' in the new PDF emitter, the item should be hidden from view.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Add a label to the PDF emitter. \n2. Open the 'properties' view. \n3. Set the 'sectionDisplay' property of the label to 'none'. \n4. Verify that the label is still visible in the new PDF emitter, despite the 'sectionDisplay' property being set to 'none'."}
