{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path of the included library instead of the relative path. For example, the property 'fileName' shows an absolute path - 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. For example, if the report design is located at '$project/test' and the library is included from '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary', the relative path should be saved.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, create a report design in the BIRT designer. Include a library that is outside of the project directory structure. Observe that the absolute path of the library is stored instead of the relative path."}
