Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled 'Error'", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and try to switch back to the Layout view, you get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The error message states 'Source page is dirty'", "EB": "The software should provide clear instructions on how to save or discard changes when switching between the 'source' view and the Layout view in the editor. The error message should be more informative and not simply mention that the 'Source page is dirty'", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, 1. Open the XML Report Designer editor. 2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view. 3. Try to switch back to the Layout view. 4. Observe the error message and confusion in understanding how to save or discard the changes."}
