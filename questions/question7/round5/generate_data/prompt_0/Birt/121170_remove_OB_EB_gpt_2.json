{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return some user recognizable strings", "description": "", "OB": "When calling IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction, the method does not return any user recognizable strings. However, when calling the same method after data extraction, it does return appropriate user recognizable labels.", "EB": "The method IMetaData.getColumnLabel() should always return user recognizable strings, regardless of whether data extraction has occurred or not.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction.\n2. Note that the method does not return any user recognizable strings.\n3. Perform data extraction.\n4. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() again.\n5. Observe that the method now returns appropriate user recognizable labels."}
