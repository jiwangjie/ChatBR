An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected.", "OB": "When creating a report parameter of type 'DateTime' in BIRT report designer and entering an invalid date string, such as '55/66/9999', the value is stored without any validation or rejection.", "EB": "The date value should have been validated either by the UI or the Model, and an error message should have been displayed to the user indicating that the entered date format is invalid.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the BIRT report designer. \n2. Create a new report parameter of type 'DateTime'. \n3. In the 'DefaultValue' field, enter an invalid date string, such as '55/66/9999'."}
