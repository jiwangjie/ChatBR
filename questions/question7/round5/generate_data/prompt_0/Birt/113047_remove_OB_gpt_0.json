The new data source should display the corresponding database/table/column information.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new data set without any SQL statement. 2. In the data set editor, go to the data source page. 3. Change the data source. 4. Notice that the new data source does not list any children nodes, such as database/table/column information. To see the expected behavior, close the data set editor and reopen it."}
