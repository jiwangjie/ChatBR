{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If an XPath expression with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'], is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
