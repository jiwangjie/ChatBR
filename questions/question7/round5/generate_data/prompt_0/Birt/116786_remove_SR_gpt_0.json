{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path of the library include. For example, <property name=\"fileName\">E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path. When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test, the relative path should be saved as lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design or open an existing one.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design.\n\nExpected result: The relative path of the library include should be saved according to the location of the report design."}
