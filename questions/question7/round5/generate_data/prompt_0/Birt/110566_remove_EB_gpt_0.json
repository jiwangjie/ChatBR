{"id": "110566", "title": "Bug 110566 - Invalid filter expression returns wrong data set result or null result set", "description": "When attempting to set a filter expression like 'row[0] equals to 0', the data set returns incorrect results or a null result set.", "OB": "When setting a filter in the data set with the expression 'row[0] equals to ', the first result record is returned when previewing the data. However, this is not the expected behavior.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the filter expression 'row[0]' should not be allowed as it can only be generated after all the data has been fetched. Therefore, it should not be taken as a valid filter expression.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Set a filter in the data set with the expression 'row[0] equals to '\n2. Click on the Preview tab\n\nThe actual result is that the first result record is returned. The expected result is that the filter expression 'row[0]' is not considered as a valid filter expression and does not return any results."}
