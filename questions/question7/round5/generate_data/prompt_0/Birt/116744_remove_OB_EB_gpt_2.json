{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "The dynamic text element is not rendering content correctly based on the specified content type.", "OB": "When using a dynamic text element to display the contents of a database field with three types of content (HTML text within <html> tags, HTML fragments not within <html> tags, and text with RTF tags), the rendered output does not reflect the expected content type.", "EB": "The dynamic text element should correctly interpret and display content based on the specified content type. Specifically:\n1) HTML text within <html> tags should render as formatted HTML.\n2) HTML fragments not within <html> tags should display as plain text or handle the HTML fragments appropriately.\n3) Text with RTF tags should render with the expected formatting based on the RTF specifications.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Populate the database field with HTML text within <html> tags.\n2. Configure a dynamic text element to display the content of the mentioned database field.\n3. Verify that the rendered output does not reflect the expected HTML formatting.\n\nRepeat the above steps for HTML fragments not within <html> tags and text with RTF tags to observe the inconsistent rendering based on the content type."}
