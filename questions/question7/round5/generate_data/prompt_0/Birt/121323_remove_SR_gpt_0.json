{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo variable is lost.", "EB": "The plain XPath expression should be used (prepending it with the path from the data set selector itself) and the filtering capability should be left for those who need it.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', for the column mapping. \n3. Leave the dialog. \n4. Check if the filter information in the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file, and if the data stored in the filterInfo variable is lost."}
