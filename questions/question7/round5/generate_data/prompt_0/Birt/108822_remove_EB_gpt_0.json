{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822: More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border values for row value", "description": "", "OB": "When performing disk sorting on a set of 40000 rows of data and specifying that the program should only process a subset of the data (less than 40000 rows), the current implementation of the software performs the following operations: 1. Save the file as a temporary file. ", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Perform a disk sort on a dataset containing 40000 rows of data. 2. Set the program to process a subset of the data, specifically less than 40000 rows. The software should then: 1. Save the file as a temporary file. 2. Load the file into memory. 3. Sort the data. 4. Save the sorted data back into a temporary file."}
