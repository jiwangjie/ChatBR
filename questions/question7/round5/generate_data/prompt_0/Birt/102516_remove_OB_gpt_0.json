{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a considerable amount of time. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This way, the initial loading time will be reduced.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the delay in loading the entire schema. Alternatively, refer to Bug 101372 for the ability to filter based on schema."}
