{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is in $project/test, the library include should store the relative path.", "OB": "When including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer is storing the absolute path instead of the expected relative path.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. The relative path should be based on the location of the report design, for instance, $project/test.", "SR": "1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Verify that the library include now stores the relative path, considering the location of the report design."}
