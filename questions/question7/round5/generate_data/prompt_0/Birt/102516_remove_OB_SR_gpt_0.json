The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, the tree is loaded immediately when the page is loaded, which can result in a significant delay for large data sources.", "OB": "Currently, the tree control is loaded immediately when the page is opened, causing a delay even for large data sources.", "EB": "The tree control should be loaded on demand, i.e., it should be loaded only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This would improve the initial loading time of the page for large data sources.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Note that the tree control containing the tables and columns is loaded immediately.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. The tree control should be loaded only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.\n2. The initial loading time of the page should be improved for large data sources."}
