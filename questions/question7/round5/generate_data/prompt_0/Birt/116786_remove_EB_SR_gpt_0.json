{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "The bug report is about an issue with the storage of absolute paths in the report design for library includes. The user is requesting that relative paths be used instead.", "OB": "Currently, the report design stores absolute paths for library includes. For example, in the property <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>, the absolute path 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' is stored. This behavior is observed in the report design.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the report design to store relative paths instead of absolute paths for library includes. For example, the property <property name='fileName' value='../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/> should be used to store the relative path '../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open the report design containing library includes. \n2. Inspect the properties of the library includes. \n3. Observe that the 'fileName' property contains absolute paths instead of relative paths."}
