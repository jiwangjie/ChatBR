{"id": "102436", "title": "Bug 102436 - Date/time value not stored correctly in report design", "description": "An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected.", "OB": "The date/time value is not stored correctly in the report design when an invalid date/time string is entered. The system does not reject the invalid input and proceeds with storing it.", "EB": "The date value should have been validated by the UI or the Model. If an invalid date/time string is entered, it should not be stored in the report design and the user should be prompted to enter a valid date/time value.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the report design form. 2. Enter an invalid date/time string in the date/time field. 3. Save the report design. The invalid date/time value should not be stored and the system should display an error message or prompt the user to enter a valid date/time value."}
