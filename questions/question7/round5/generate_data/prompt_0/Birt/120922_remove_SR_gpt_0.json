{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: Dirty Page behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very clear. The error message is 'Source page is dirty.' Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes.", "OB": "When switching from the 'source' view to the Layout view in the XML Report Designer editor, an error message is displayed stating that the source page is dirty and needs to be saved. This prevents the user from switching to other pages until the source is saved.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog with a clearer title indicating that the XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog should not include quotes in the title.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view.\n3. Try to switch back to the Layout view.\n4. Observe the error message indicating that the source page is dirty and needs to be saved before switching to other pages."}
