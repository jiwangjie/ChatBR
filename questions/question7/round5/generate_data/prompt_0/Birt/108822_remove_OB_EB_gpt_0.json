{"id": "108822", "title": "More accurate logic needed for disk sorting with border values in row data", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk, if the sorting process is set to work on less than 40000 rows of data, the program performs the following operations: 1. Saves the file as a temporary file. 2. Calls the file into memory. 3. Performs the sorting operation on the data. 4. Saves the file as a temporary file.", "EB": "The program should accurately process disk sorting when there are border values in the row data, even when the sorting process is set to work on less than 40000 rows.", "SR": "To reproduce, follow these steps: 1. Set the sorting process to work on less than 40000 rows of data with border values in the row data. 2. Run the program and observe the disk sorting operation."}
