{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This results in several hundred tables being displayed. However, when using the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, I observed that the schema filter does not prevent the warning message from appearing during load, since the entire tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, it should only query and load the necessary tables and columns for display, instead of querying and loading the entire schema. This would prevent the warning message and improve the loading time of the JDBC Data Set Editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the data set editor. \n2. Observe that the entire schema is queried and loaded, resulting in the warning message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.\n\nBug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> asks for the ability to filter based on schema, which could be considered as a potential solution to this issue."}
