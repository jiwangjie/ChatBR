{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If a user enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can cause a lot of trouble.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Exit the dialog.\n5. Check if the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
