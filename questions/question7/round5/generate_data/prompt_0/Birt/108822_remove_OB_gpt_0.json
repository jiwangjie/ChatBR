{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient disk sorting logic needed for border row values", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "More efficient disk sorting logic is expected when there are border values for row values. The file should be copied to the destination folder. The data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000 rows. 3. Save the file as a temporary file. 4. Load the file into memory. 5. Sort the data. 6. Save the file as a temporary file again."}
