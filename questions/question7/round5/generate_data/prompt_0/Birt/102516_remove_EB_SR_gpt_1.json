{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Currently, in the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the schema filter is present, but the tree is still being populated on load, resulting in a warning message.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being loaded on page load. This causes a warning message to appear.", "EB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor should only load tables and columns on demand, based on user interactions. This will prevent the warning message and improve performance.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers:  \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.  \n2. Notice that the tree control lists every schema on the system and loads all the tables and columns on page load.  \n3. Observe the warning message that appears as a result. "}
