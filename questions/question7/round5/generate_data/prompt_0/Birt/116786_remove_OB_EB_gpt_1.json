{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer currently generates an absolute path and saves it. This behavior may lead to issues when sharing or moving the project to a different location.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path of the included library in the report design. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test and includes a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the stored path should be relative, not absolute.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design located in a specific project folder (e.g., $project/test).\n3. Include a library in the report design from another location (e.g., $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary).\n4. Save the report design and observe that the included library path is stored as an absolute path instead of a relative path."}
