However, when leaving the dialog, the `RelationInformation` is persisted to `.rptdesign`, but the data stored in `filterInfo` is lost. This could cause trouble.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information.

Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as `section[@id='left']`.\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in `filterInfo` HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check if the data stored in `filterInfo` is preserved in the `.rptdesign` after leaving the dialog."}
