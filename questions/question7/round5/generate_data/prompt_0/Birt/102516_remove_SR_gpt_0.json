{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This easily results in several hundred tables. When using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I observed that the schema filter partially works, but I still receive a warning message on load since the tree is being populated entirely during the load process.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query loads all schemas (aka catalogs) and their associated tables and columns during the initial load. Even with a schema filter in place, a warning message is displayed every time the page is loaded.", "EB": "The loading of the tree control should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This would prevent unnecessary loading of all schemas and improve the performance of the page.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Observe the initial loading of the tree control, displaying all schemas and tables.\n3. Apply a schema filter.\n4. Notice that a warning message is still displayed on load, indicating that the tree control is being fully populated during load.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The loading of the tree control should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.\n- The warning message should not be displayed when a schema filter is applied."}
