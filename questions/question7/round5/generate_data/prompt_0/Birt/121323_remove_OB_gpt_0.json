This means that the filter settings are lost and not persisted in the .rptdesign file.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should retain the filter information when it is closed and reopened. The entered XPath expression, including the selection part, should be stored in the .rptdesign file and not lost.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'. \n3. Notice that this selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. \n4. Close the dialog and reopen it. \n5. Verify that the entered XPath expression and the selection part are not retained and are lost, as the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is not persisted."}
