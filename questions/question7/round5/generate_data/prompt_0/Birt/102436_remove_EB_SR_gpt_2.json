The invalid value is accepted, and the resulting definition appears in the report design.", "EB": "The system should reject an invalid date/time string during the creation of a 'DateTime' type report parameter. The model should store a dateTime type constant using the XML schema date/time format (yyyymmddThh:mm:ss, see http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema2/), which is locale-independent, ensuring portability.", "SR": "1. Open BIRT report designer.\n2. Create a new report parameter of type 'DateTime'.\n3. In the 'default value' field, enter an invalid date string like '55/66/9999'.\n4.
