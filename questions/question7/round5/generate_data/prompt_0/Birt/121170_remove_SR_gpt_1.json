{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170: get column label from meta data object should return some user recognizable strings", "description": "The bug report is about the `get column label` function in the meta data object. Currently, this function is returning null labels before extraction and recognizable strings after extraction.", "OB": "Before extraction, the labels returned by the `get column label` function are null. After extraction, the labels are recognizable strings.", "EB": "The bug should be fixed so that the `get column label` function returns recognizable strings even before extraction. The labels need to be displayed to the end user before extraction, so the same labels should be returned before and after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, 1) Call the `get column label` function on a meta data object before extraction. 2) Call the `get column label` function again on the same meta data object after extraction. Compare the labels returned in both cases and verify that they are different."}
