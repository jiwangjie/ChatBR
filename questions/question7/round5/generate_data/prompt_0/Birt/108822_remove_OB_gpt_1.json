Specifically, the data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Copy the file to the destination folder. \n2. Ensure that the program is set to process less than 40,000 rows of data. \n3. Perform the following operations: \n   a. Save the file as a temporary file. \n   b. Load the file into memory. \n   c. Sort the data. \n   d. Save the sorted data to the temporary file."}
