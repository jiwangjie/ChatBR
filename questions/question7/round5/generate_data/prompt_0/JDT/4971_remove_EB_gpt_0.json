Create a new project (project A). \n2. Open the package viewer. \n3. Select a package in project A. \n4. From the context menu, choose the 'copy' option. \n5. Specify project X as the destination project for the copied package. \n6. Verify that the package 'ui' is created in project X instead of the expected package name."}
