It moves the text, but it is unclear how the behavior is specified. In the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character, effectively getting rid of the tab. Additionally, the presence of a stray space also confuses the behavior, as the user is unable to determine why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the document containing lines with both tabs and spaces. \n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually align the two lines. \n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command. \n4. Observe the behavior of the text movement and the inconsistency with expected behavior."}
