{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9619Move static member: Dialog details 20020212a. Mnemonicsb. No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g. ", "OB": "The browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes). The title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Click on the browse button and observe that it is too small.\n2. Enter long text in the title and go to the next page to see the incorrect message 'Type not found'.\n3. Open the dialog and observe that types from source folders of other projects are also shown.\n4. Try to move a static member to the same type and notice the incorrect warning and changes in referencing classes."}
