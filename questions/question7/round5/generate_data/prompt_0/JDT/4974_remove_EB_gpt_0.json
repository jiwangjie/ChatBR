{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the project properties to use the project as source folder and the project as output location, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are separate operations, and by setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location. \n3. Press 'Ok' to save the changes."}
