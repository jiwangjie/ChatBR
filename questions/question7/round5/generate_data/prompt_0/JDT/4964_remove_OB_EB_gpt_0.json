{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The code assist feature automatically inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()' when the user types 'button.dispose'.", "EB": "Code assist should prioritize 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' as it is a closer match to the user's input. Additionally, code assist should be case sensitive in automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code.  \n2. Type 'button.dispose'.  \n3. Observe that the code assist feature automatically inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. "}
