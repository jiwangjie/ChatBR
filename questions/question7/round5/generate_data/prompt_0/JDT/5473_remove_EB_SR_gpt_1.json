Currently, it is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the given scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (to remove the tab). However, it is confusing when there is a stray space because it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n3. Observe the unexpected movement of the text."}
