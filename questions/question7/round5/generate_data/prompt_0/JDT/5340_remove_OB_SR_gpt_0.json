The cancellation request is ignored.", "EB": "The progress dialog should honor the cancellation request when adding an exception breakpoint. It should either cancel the process or disable the cancel button. This can be achieved by passing 'false' for the 'cancelable' parameter when calling 'ProgressMonitorDialog.run'.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1) Open the application\n2) Navigate to the exception breakpoint page\n3) Start adding an exception breakpoint\n4) While the progress dialog is running, click the 'Cancel' button"}
