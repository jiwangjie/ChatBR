{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "The current behavior is not specified.", "EB": "Like the validation (checking classpath and output location at once), the setting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Note that the error message is strange. It should be modified to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
