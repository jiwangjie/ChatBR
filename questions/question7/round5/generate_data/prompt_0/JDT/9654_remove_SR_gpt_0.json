{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters - Dialog Details", "description": "Bug 9654 - Modify Parameters: Dialog details duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page. The first and second column could be merged.", "OB": "a. The buttons are too small. b. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled. c. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off. d. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. b. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. c. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied on more than one item. d. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog. 2. Observe the small size of the buttons. 3. Check that no table entry is selected when the dialog comes up. 4. Try changing a parameter name to something very long and observe the cut-off preview. 5. Test with a method that has many parameters to see the huge dialog size. 6. Notice the large marking between the button and list. 7. Check for alignment issues between the top button and the dialog top. 8. Look for a missing label in the table. 9. Attempt to select multiple items in the table and use the move up / down buttons. 10. Verify that the signature preview wraps properly. 11. Check if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover."}
