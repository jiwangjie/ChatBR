The user is confused about the meaning of this message and whether it is an error. Additionally, it is noted that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. ", "EB": "The New Package Wizard should not display the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' when the package name field is empty. Instead, the wizard should only show this message if the user enters a package name that already exists. The 'Finish' button should be disabled when the package name field is empty, and no error/warning message should be displayed. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Invoke the New Java Package wizard. \n2. Leave the package name field empty. \n3. Verify that the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' appears at the top, which is confusing. \n4. Also, check if the 'Finish' button is enabled when the package name field is empty."}
