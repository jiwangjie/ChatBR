{"id": "7330", "title": "Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions on text selection seem to be distributed based on personal preference, which is not clear to users. This should be changed so that all actions on text selection are easily accessible. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views in order to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "All actions on text selection should be accessible either in the context menu or directly from the editor, without the need to switch views.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select some text and check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the context menu. If not, switch to the Outline view and check again."}
