{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation to check if the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. This will help avoid issues with pointing the output folder to a bin directory containing unnecessary files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new project. 2. Select an existing directory structure. 3. Point the output folder to a bin directory. 4. Confirm that the software checks if the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt."}
