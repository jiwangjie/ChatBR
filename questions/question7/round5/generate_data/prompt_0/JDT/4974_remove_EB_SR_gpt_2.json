{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok after setting the output location and classpath, the following error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue arises because setting the output location and classpath are currently treated as two separate operations, resulting in an illegal state being created.", "EB": "When changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and output location, the software should correctly handle the classpath and output location as a single operation to avoid creating an illegal state.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the settings menu.\n2. Navigate to the classpath configuration.\n3. Set the desired output location.\n4. Set the classpath.\n5. Press the Ok button.\n6. Observe the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
