{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or check to ensure that the output directory (bin directory) can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files. It may contain other files or folders that should not be deleted. This prevents the bin directory from being properly rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project, the system should first check if the designated output directory (bin directory) can be safely deleted and rebuilt. Users should be prompted with a warning if the bin directory contains files or directories that cannot be regenerated from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, follow these steps:\n  1. Create a new project.\n  2. Set the output directory (bin directory) to a directory that contains additional files or folders.\n  3. Proceed with the project creation. The system should not display any confirmation or warning regarding the presence of non-regeneratable files in the bin directory."}
