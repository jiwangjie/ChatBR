{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message (1GD0L9O)", "description": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message (1GD0L9O)", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even when the package name field is empty. This message is confusing and it is unclear whether it is an error or a warning. It is also suggested that if it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon.", "EB": "The New Package Wizard should not display an error or warning message when the package name field is empty. If there is a folder corresponding to the package name that already exists, an informative message should be displayed to guide the user on how to proceed. If there are any errors during the package creation process, they should be clearly indicated with an appropriate error message and visual indication (e.g., displayed in red with an error icon).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new Java Project. 2. Select the project. 3. Invoke the New Java Package feature."}
