{"id": "8142", "title": "Bug 8142: No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "Bug 8142: No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects. I am not able to understand it.", "OB": "When I try to view the scoped type hierarchy on binary projects (for example, org.apache.ant), I get the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. Also, could you please provide an explanation of what the message means?", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open the project with binary files. 2. Navigate to the scoped type hierarchy view. 3. Select the 'org.apache.ant' package. 4. Observe the message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'."}
