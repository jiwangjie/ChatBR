{"id": "8142", "title": "Bug 8142: No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "Bug 8142: No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects. I don't understand it.", "OB": "When I hit F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. 'org.apache.ant'), I get the following error message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, what does the message mean?", "EB": "When I hit F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. 'org.apache.ant'), I should be able to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars instead of encountering an error message saying 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant''.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a binary project.\n2. Select a binary project to view its type hierarchy.\n3. Press F4 to open the type hierarchy dialog.\n4. Select 'org.apache.ant' or any other library.\n5. Observe the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant''."}
