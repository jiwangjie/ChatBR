{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or warning displayed to inform the user that the output directory (bin directory) can be deleted and rebuilt. This can lead to a problem where some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files and cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files. ", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the application and navigate to the project creation page. \n2. Choose an existing directory structure as the project location. \n3. Specify the bin directory as the output folder. \n4. Complete the project creation process. \n5. Check if there is a confirmation or warning message displayed regarding the deletion and rebuilding of the bin directory."}
