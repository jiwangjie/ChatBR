", "OB": "When executing the ShiftLeft function on two lines that have a combination of tabs and spaces, the text does not move.", "EB": "The ShiftLeft function should move the second line to the left, and the first line should be shifted left until it reaches the first non-whitespace character (i.e., remove the tab). Additionally, if there is a stray space, it should not prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following:\n<space><tab>some text\n<tab>some text2\n3. Select the two lines above and execute the ShiftLeft function.\n\nExpected behavior: The text should be shifted to the left, but currently, nothing moves."}
