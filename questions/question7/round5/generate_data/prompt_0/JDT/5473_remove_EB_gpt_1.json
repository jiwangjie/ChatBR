{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473 ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the given scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). It is confusing if there is a stray space, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. In a default text editor, type in the following: <space><tab>some text<tab>some text2. 2. Now highlight the two lines and execute ShiftLeft. Notice that nothing moves."}
