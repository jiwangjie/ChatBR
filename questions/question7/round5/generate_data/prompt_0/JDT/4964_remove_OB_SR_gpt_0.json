{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The automatic code assist selects 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'", "EB": "The code assist should recognize that 'dispose()' is a more appropriate suggestion than 'DISPOSED'", "SR": "To reproduce, type '(' after an object and observe the suggestions provided by the code assist feature"}
