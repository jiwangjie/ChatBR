Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the superclass), so could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g. Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes)c. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.e. destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "The browse button in the dialog is too small. When going to the next page, it displays the message 'Type not found'. The dialog shows types from a different project instead of only types from the source folders of the current project. In the refactoring process, selecting the destination type as the source type incorrectly warns about resulting errors and makes pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Observe the size of the browse button.\n3. Progress to the next page and observe the displayed message.\n4. Note the types displayed in the dialog.\n5. Perform a refactoring process and select the destination type as the source type.\n6. Notice the warning about resulting errors and the pseudo-changes in referencing classes."}
