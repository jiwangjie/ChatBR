I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, we distribute the actions based on personal preference. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not (not all need to be in the context menu, but all must be reachable from the editor, e.g., via the Edit menu).", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available on text selection. It can only be found after switching to the Outline view.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available on text selection without the need to switch to the Outline view. All actions should be accessible either from the context menu or the Edit menu.", "SR": "To reproduce, select any text and check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the context menu. Also, try accessing it through the Edit menu."}
