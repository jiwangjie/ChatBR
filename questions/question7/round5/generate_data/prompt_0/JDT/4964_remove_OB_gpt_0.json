{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The code assist feature automatically inserts the wrong method name (DISPOSED) instead of the desired method name (dispose()).", "EB": "The code assist feature should intelligently suggest the correct method name based on the context and not suggest unrelated options.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code. 2. Type 'button.dispose'. 3. Note that the code assist list pops up, but the user may not be aware of it."}
