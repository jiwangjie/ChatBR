{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473 ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab. The presence of a stray space also adds to the confusion, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "Executing ShiftLeft should move the selected lines to the left, aligning them visually and removing the tab characters. Any stray spaces should be ignored in the shifting process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. In a default text editor, type in the following:\n<space\n<tab>some text\n<tab>some text2\n2. Now, highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft. Notice that nothing moves."}
