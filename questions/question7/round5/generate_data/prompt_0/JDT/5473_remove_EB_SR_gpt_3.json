It is unclear from the current specification, but in this scenario, it is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). It is also confusing if there is a stray space, as the reason for the text not shifting is not apparent.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the ShiftLeft command is executed, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, even if there is a stray space present.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same. 2. Execute the ShiftLeft command. Observe that the text moves incorrectly."}
