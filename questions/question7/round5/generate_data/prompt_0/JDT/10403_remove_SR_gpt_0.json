{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or warning that the output directory (referred to as 'bin' directory) can be deleted and then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files. This bin directory may contain files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "During project creation, there should be a confirmation or warning message informing the user that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the application and navigate to the project creation section.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure for the project.\n3. Set the output folder (bin directory) to a directory that contains more than just .class files.\n4. Create the project.\nExpected behavior: A confirmation or warning message should appear, informing the user that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
