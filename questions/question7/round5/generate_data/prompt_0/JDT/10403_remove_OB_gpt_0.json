{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the software does not confirm whether the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This leads to some users creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The software should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure. This confirmation is necessary to prevent users from mistakenly pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains unnecessary files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n3. Notice that the software does not provide a confirmation or warning message about the bin directory contents being unnecessary and deletable."}
