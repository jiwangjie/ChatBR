{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist list appears. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose(). Then, I type '('. But as soon as I type the '(', the automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, I expect it to be smarter in choosing the appropriate suggestion. In this case, when I type '(', the code assist should consider that it matches 'dispose()' better than 'DISPOSED' and insert 'dispose()' instead.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Start writing SWT code.\n2. Type 'button.dispose'.\n3. As soon as the automatic code assist list appears, type '('.\n4. Observe that the code assist inserts the wrong suggestion instead of 'dispose()'."}
