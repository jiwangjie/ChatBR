The behavior is confusing and unclear.", "EB": "When executing ShiftLeft with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text should shift left. In the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be replaced with spaces). The presence of stray spaces or tabs should not prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "1. Open a document containing lines with both tabs and spaces as indentation.\n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n4. Observe that the text does not shift as expected."}
