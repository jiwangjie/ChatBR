It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab. It is confusing if there is a stray space since it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
