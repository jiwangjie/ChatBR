{"id": "6009", "title": "Bug 6009 - New class wizard doesn't get context right for nested classes", "description": "", "OB": "When using the new class wizard in build 20011106, the context for nested classes is not correctly determined. Specifically, when a .java file is open in the editor and the user clicks the new class button, the 'Enclosing Type' field is blank.", "EB": "The 'Enclosing Type' field in the new class wizard should default to the current type in the editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a .java file in the editor.\n2. Click the new class button.\n3. Check the 'Enclosing Type' field in the new class wizard; it should be blank (instead of defaulting to the current type in the editor)."}
