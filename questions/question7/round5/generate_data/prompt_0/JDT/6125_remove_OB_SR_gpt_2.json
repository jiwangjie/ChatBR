If there are unsaved editors, a dialog should be displayed to allow saving them before proceeding with the JAR creation.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open multiple files in the IDE. 2. Make changes to some of the files without saving them. 3. Open the JAR packager wizard. 4. Enter all the necessary fields. 5. Click 'Finish'."}
