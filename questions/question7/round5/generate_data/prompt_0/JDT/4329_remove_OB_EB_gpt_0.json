Open the Package view. \n2. Right-click on a package. \n3. Select the 'Search' option from the context menu. \n4. In the search dialog, enter a keyword for declarations. \n5. Click the 'Search' button. \n6. Observe that no search results are displayed. \n\nNote: Searching via the context menu in the packages view works as expected. The search functionality should first try to get the Java element and if that fails, it should display the element name and not the fully qualified name."}
