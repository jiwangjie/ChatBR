When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found.' Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.e. The destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "The browse button should have a standard size (using SWTUtil for standard button sizes). The title should not be used for long text. When going to the next page, it should display a message indicating that the specified type was not found.
