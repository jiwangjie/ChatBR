It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). Regardless, it is confusing when there is a stray space present, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, executing the ShiftLeft command should only shift the second line to the left, while the first line should be shifted at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). Regardless, it is confusing when there is a stray space present, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces, ensuring that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n3. Observe that the text moves, but it is unclear how it is supposed to behave. The first line should be shifted at least up to the space character, and the second line should be shifted left."}
