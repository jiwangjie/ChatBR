I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "When selecting text, the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu or any other global menu.", "EB": "I expected the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" to be available when selecting text in the context menu or some other global menu.", "SR": "To reproduce, select text in the editor and check for the availability of the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action in the context menu or any other global menu."}
