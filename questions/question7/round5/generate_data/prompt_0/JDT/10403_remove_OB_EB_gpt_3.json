{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or validation performed on the output directory. As a result, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "We should enhance the project creation process to include a confirmation step that checks whether the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. This will ensure that users are aware of potential issues with their chosen directory and can make the necessary changes if required.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory.\n2. Provide a bin directory as the output folder.\n3. Ensure that the bin directory contains more than just .class files.\n4. Attempt to create the project.\n5. The creation process should prompt for confirmation and display a warning if the bin directory cannot be scrubbed."}
