Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory. However, this bin directory contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory.\n3. Confirm that the system does not provide a warning or confirmation regarding the existing content in the bin directory.\n4. Delete the output directory manually.\n5. Rebuild the output directory.\n6. Note that the system should provide a warning or confirmation before deleting the existing content in the bin directory."}
