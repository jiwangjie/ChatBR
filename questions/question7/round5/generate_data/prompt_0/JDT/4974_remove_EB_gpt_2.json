{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and output location, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue arises because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, leading to an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "When changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and output location, the software should correctly handle the classpath and output location as a single operation to avoid creating an illegal state.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Go to the project properties. 3. Change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location. 4. Press Ok."}
