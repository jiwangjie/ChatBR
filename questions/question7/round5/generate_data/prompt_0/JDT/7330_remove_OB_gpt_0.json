I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available when selecting text. It can only be accessed after switching to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the Edit menu or some other global menu without requiring the user to switch views. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Select text in the editor.\n2. Open the Edit menu (or some other global menu) and try to find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment'."}
