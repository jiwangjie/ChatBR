{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters - Dialog details", "description": "When modifying parameters in the dialog details, there are several issues that need to be addressed:\ni. Duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second column could be merged.\n\nOB: \n- marking between button and list is too large\n\nEB: \n- The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\n- The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n- Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up/down can be applied on more than one item.\n- The signature preview must be a label that wraps.\n- It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.\n\nSR: \nTo reproduce the issues: \n1. Open the modify parameters dialog.\n2. Change a parameter name to something very long.\n3. Observe how the preview is cut off."}
