{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing the 'Ok' button, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue arises because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. This creates an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
