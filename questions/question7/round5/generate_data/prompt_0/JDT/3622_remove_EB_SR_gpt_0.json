I'm not sure what this message means, and I'm confused about whether it's an error or not. It would be helpful if this message could be displayed in red with an error icon if it is indeed an error.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the 'New Java Package' wizard. 2. Leave the package name field empty. 3. Observe the message that appears at the top and the presence of an error icon (if applicable) to determine the clarity and accuracy of the warning message."}
