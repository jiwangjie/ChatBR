{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok after setting the output location, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. It appears that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations, and setting the output location creates an illegal state.", "EB": "For bug 4974, the setting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation that checks the classpath and output location simultaneously. Additionally, the error message should be clarified to display: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Set the output location for a project\n2. Press Ok\n3. Observe the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'"}
