{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "Specify Server port=1 in server.xml. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. jsvc may show the same behavior, but not confirmed.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service in Tomcat, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Despite this error message, Tomcat stops successfully. After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() performs System.exit(1) resulting in Tomcat shutdown. It is observed that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service in Tomcat, there should be no error message printed in the log file as the shutdown port is properly configured. Tomcat should stop successfully without printing any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the server.xml file in the Tomcat installation directory.\n2. Look for the Server element.\n3. Set the port attribute of the Server element to 1.\n4. Start the Tomcat Windows service.\n5. Check the catalina.20100427.log file for the error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'"}
