{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully. [1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html Downgrading user When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. 3. Actual behaviour: The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "The connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(). Instead, the binding happens later when the start() method is called. This behavior is different from TC6 where there is a separate prestartup phase allowing connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. The fix for BZ 48625 is broken due to this. When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (80). However, even without jsvc, the issue is observed during the testing of the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625. The second instance fails in an unexpected way. Initially, the exception does not occur because the connector does not try to bind to the port until the start() method is called. The startup sequence then continues and fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load() instead of waiting until the start() method is called. This behavior should be consistent with TC6 where connectors are allowed to bind to their ports during a separate prestartup phase before other parts of Tomcat are started. The fix for BZ 48625 needs to take this into account. When running with jsvc, Tomcat should be able to bind to privileged ports (80). The second instance should fail in the expected way. The exception should occur when the connector tries to bind to the port, preventing the startup sequence from continuing.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully. 2. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 3. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
