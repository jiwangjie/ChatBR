However, an error message is printed which is not necessary. This bug report suggests improvements on how Tomcat can be stopped without showing this error message. It is also mentioned that jsvc may exhibit similar behavior but it has not been tried.", "OB": "When stopping the Tomcat service, an error message is printed despite the service successfully shutting down.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when stopping the Tomcat service as it causes confusion and is not necessary.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal by calling Catalina.stop() function."}
