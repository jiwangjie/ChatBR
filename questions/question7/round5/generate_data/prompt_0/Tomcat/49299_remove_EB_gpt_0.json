{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1: Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299 - Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 incorrectly states that a custom cookie name affects URL rewriting.", "OB": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual behavior observed is different. The page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses the default 'jsessionid' parameter in the URL instead of the custom name.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL, provided that URL rewriting has been enabled.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file. \n2. Access 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'.\n3. Observe the behavior where the 'Reload' link in the page's HTML uses the 'jsessionid' parameter in the URL instead of the custom cookie name."}
