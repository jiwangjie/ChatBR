{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstart.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960.", "OB": "The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connectors should bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() stage, before other parts of Tomcat are started.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Start the first instance successfully. \n2. Start the second instance and observe that it fails. \n3. Verify that the connector does not try to bind to the port during the initial start and only binds when start() is called."}
