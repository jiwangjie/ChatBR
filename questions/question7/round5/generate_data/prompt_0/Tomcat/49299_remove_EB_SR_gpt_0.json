However, the observed behavior does not align with this statement. Instead of using the custom cookie name, the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' as the name of the parameter in the URL.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the custom name should also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled).

Open the provided attachment 25442 [details]cookiename.war.\n2. Navigate to the page where the Reload link is displayed.\n3. Click on the Reload link.\n4.
