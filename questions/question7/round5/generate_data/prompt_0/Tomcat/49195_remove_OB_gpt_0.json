That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using Tomcat as a service on Windows and specifying the shutdown port as 1 in the server.xml configuration file, the service is successfully stopped but displays an error message in the console.", "EB": "If the shutdown port is set to 1 in the server.xml configuration file, the service should be stopped without displaying any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as by calling Catalina.stop()."}
