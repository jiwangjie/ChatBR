However, the actual behavior does not match the documentation.", "OB": "The page sets a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "I would expect the 'Reload' link to use the custom cookie name ('MYSESSIONCOOKIE') instead of 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file.\n2. Open the URL 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp'.\n3. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page.\n4. Observe that the URL includes 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name."}
