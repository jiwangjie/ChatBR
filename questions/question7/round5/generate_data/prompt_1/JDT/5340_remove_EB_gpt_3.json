{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog immediately closes. However, the exception list still pops up, ignoring the cancellation request. It is expected that either the cancellation request should be honored, or the cancel button should be disabled. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancelable' parameter should be set to false.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Open the debug perspective and navigate to the breakpoints pane. 2) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception breakpoint. 3) In the progress dialog, click the 'cancel' button."}
