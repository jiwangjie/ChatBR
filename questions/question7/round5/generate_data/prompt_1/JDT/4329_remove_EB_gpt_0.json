However, it is unable to find any results. Searching via the context menu in the packages view works as expected.", "EB": "The Search dialog should first attempt to get the Java element when searching, and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the Package view. \n2. Select a package. \n3. Open the Search dialog. \n4. Search for a declaration. \n5. Note that no results are found. \n\nExpected behavior: \nThe Search dialog should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name when no results are found. \n\nNOTES:"}
