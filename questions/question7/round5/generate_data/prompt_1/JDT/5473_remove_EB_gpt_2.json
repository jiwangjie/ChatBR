{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 - ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "In a default text editor, if the first line is indented with a tab character and the second line is indented with spaces, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text. It is expected that executing ShiftLeft should shift the second line left and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be replaced with spaces). The presence of a stray space makes it confusing as to why the text won't shift.", "EB": "When the first line is indented with a tab character and the second line is indented with spaces, executing ShiftLeft should move both lines to the left so that they are indented the same visually. The tab character in the first line should be replaced with spaces.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following:\n    <space character>\n    <tab character>\n    some text\n    <tab character>\n    some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines written above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nExpected result:\nBoth lines should move to the left and become visually indented the same way."}
