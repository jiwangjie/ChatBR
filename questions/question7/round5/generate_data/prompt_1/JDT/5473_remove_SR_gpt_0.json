", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, and then ShiftLeft is executed, the text does not move. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the first space character where the tab is. Additionally, it is confusing and not clear why the text won't shift when there is a stray space.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually indent the two lines the same, and executing ShiftLeft, the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the first space character where the tab is. The second line should also be shifted left. It should be clearly specified how this behavior is intended. Additionally, there should not be any confusion or unexpected behavior when there is a stray space present.", "SR": "1.
