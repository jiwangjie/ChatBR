I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, I don't understand what this message means.", "OB": "When I hit F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. org.apache.ant), I get the error message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open a binary project and press F4 on a selection from the project (e.g. org.apache.ant)."}
