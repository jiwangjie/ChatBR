{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "There is a bug with the ShiftLeft behavior when there are intermixed tabs and spaces. Build 200110251.", "OB": "When I replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, and then execute ShiftLeft, the text does not move. It is confusing because I expect the second line to be shifted left and the first line to be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). It's also confusing when there is a stray space because it's unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n  - <space>\n  - <tab>some text\n  - <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n   - Notice that nothing moves."}
