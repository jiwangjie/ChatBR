{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, a confusing message is displayed before any input is entered into the package name field. The message states 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. The user is unsure of what this message means and if it indicates an error. It is suggested that if this is an error, the message should be displayed in red with an error icon. There should be no error message displayed when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Additionally, there is an issue with creating a default package as it cannot be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, before entering any input into the package name field, a message saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top of the screen.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, before entering any input into the package name field, a warning message saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top of the screen.
