Build 200110251.", "OB": "When executing the ShiftLeft command with intermixed tabs and spaces in the text, the behavior is not as expected.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually, executing ShiftLeft should move the text correctly. In the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). If there is a stray space, it is confusing as the text won't shift and the reason behind it is not clear.", "SR": "1. Open a document with intermixed tabs and spaces in the text.\n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n4. Verify that the second line is shifted left and the first line is shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Make sure there are no stray spaces causing confusion."}
