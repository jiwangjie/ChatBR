{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When you press Ok after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, you get the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that setting the output location and the classpath are two separate operations. By setting the output location first and then changing the source folder, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Go to the project properties. \n3. Change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
