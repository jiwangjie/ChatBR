When adding a parameter to the `baz` call in `bar` to make the program correct, the code is changed incorrectly. Instead of giving `baz(x.foo().foo())`, it should give `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())`.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Change the `baz` call to `baz(x.x.foo())`.\n2. Place the cursor after the first `x.`.\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist.\n4. Type `f` to filter the list.\n5. Select `foo()`.\n6. Verify that the code completion suggests `baz(x.foo(), x.foo())`.", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\n```\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n```\n\nInstead of giving:\n\n```\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n```\n\nThe code assist is eating too much code.", "EB": "The code is changed to:\n\n```\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n```\n\nInstead of giving:\n\n```\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n```\n\nThe code assist should not eat any additional code.", "SR": "Change the `baz` call to `baz(x.x.foo())`.
