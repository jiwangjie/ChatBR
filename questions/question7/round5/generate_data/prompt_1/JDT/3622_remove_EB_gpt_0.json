{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' option, a confusing message appears at the top saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message appears even when the package name field is empty, causing confusion. It is unclear whether this is an error or a warning. Additionally, it is suggested to consider displaying this message in red with an error icon if it is an error. There is also a note mentioning that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. It is stated that the default package cannot be created by the user since it is always there.", "OB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' option, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message appears regardless of whether the package name field is empty. The purpose and nature of this message are unclear.", "EB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' option, no message should appear at the top if the package name field is empty. If the field is not empty and a folder corresponding to the package name already exists, then an appropriate warning message should be displayed. To provide better visual indication, consider displaying this warning message in red with an error icon.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new Java Project. \n2. Select the project. \n3. Use the 'New Java Package' option."}
