Open the Package view. \n2. Use the search dialog to search for declarations. \n3. Observe that no results are displayed. \n\nExpected: The search should display the relevant declarations in the Package view.", "NOTES": "Search via the context menu in packages view works as expected. In Java search, the search functionality should first try to get the Java element and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name."}
