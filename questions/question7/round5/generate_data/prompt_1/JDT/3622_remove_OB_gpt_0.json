It is also unclear if the message should be displayed in red with the error icon.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, before any input is provided, no message should appear at the top. The package name field should be empty. There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled if no package name is provided. If a package name is already entered, the wizard should check if a folder corresponding to the package name already exists and display an appropriate error message if necessary. If an error message is displayed, it should be in red with the error icon.", "SR": "1. Create a new Java Project.\n2. Select the project.\n3. Invoke the New Java Package wizard."}
