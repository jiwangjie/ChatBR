{"id": "7330", "title": "Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis, which should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, for example, via the Edit menu. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view."}
