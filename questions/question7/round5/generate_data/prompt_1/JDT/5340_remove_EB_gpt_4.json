{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up despite the cancellation request, indicating that the cancellation request is being ignored. Instead, the cancellation request should be honored, or at the very minimum, the cancel button should be disabled. When calling the ProgressMonitorDialog.run function, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to False in order to prevent cancellation.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Open the debug perspective and go to the breakpoints pane. 2) Click the J! button to add an exception breakpoint. 3) In the progress dialog that appears, click cancel."}
