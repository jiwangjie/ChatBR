I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis, which should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. Not all actions need to be in the context menu, but all actions must be reachable from the editor. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a section of text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Look for the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" in the context menu.\n\nExpected result: The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be present in the context menu."}
