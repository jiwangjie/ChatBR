{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist (1GDRYW5)", "description": "Under certain circumstances, code assist in the UI is eating too much code when using the code assist end position. The program's behavior should be that the code assist replaces only a specific portion of the code. Here is an example class where the issue occurs. As a programmer, I need to add a parameter to the baz call in bar to make the program correct. The 'codeassist' option has been removed from the UI to control the amount of source code to be replaced.", "OB": "Code assist is eating too much code.", "EB": "Code assist should replace only a specific portion of the code.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Change the baz call to baz(x.x.foo())\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'\n3. Press CtrlSpace to bring up code assist\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list\n5. Select 'foo()'"}
