{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When writing SWT code and using the code assist feature, I typed 'button.dispose' but accidentally selected 'DISPOSED' from the code assist list. As a result, the code assist automatically inserted 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()', which was not the expected behavior.", "EB": "The code assist feature should be smarter and notice that when I type '(' after 'dispose', it matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. It should not automatically insert 'DISPOSED' in this case.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the code editor for SWT code. \n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'. \n3. Observe the code assist list as you type. \n4. Without looking at the code assist list, continue typing '(' after 'dispose'. \n5. Observe that the code assist automatically inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. "}
