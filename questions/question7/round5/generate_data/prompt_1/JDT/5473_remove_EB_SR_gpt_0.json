However, in the current scenario, the second line is not shifted left and it is unclear why the text won't shift. Additionally, in the first scenario, it seems like the first line should also be shifted left at least until the space character (i.e., remove the tab). It is confusing if there is a stray space present.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the affected file in the editor.\n2.
