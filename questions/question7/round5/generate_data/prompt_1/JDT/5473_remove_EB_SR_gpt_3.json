{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 - ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character is used in the first line and spaces are used in the second line for indentation, executing the ShiftLeft operation does not produce the expected behavior. The text does not shift as anticipated. It is unclear from the specifications, but in this scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left to the first non-space character (i.e., remove the tab). Currently, if there is an extra space present, the text does not shift and the behavior is confusing.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing the ShiftLeft operation should move the text correctly. The second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left to the first non-space character (i.e., removing the tab). Additionally, the presence of a stray space should not prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a file with intermixed tabs and spaces for indentation.\n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces.\n3. Ensure both lines are visually indented the same.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n\nObserve that the text does not shift as expected."}
