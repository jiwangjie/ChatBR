{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist (1GDRYW5)", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature eats too much code. The following class is provided as an example:\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}\n\nAs a programmer, I need to add a parameter to the 'baz' method call in the 'bar' method to make the program correct.", "OB": "No observed behavior is mentioned in the bug report.", "EB": "The code should be changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo());\n\nInstead of:\n\nbaz(x.foo());", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open a code editor.\n2. Write a class similar to the provided example:\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}\n\n3. Invoke the code completion feature when typing the 'baz' method call in the 'bar' method.\n4. Observe that the code assist feature only suggests the 'foo' method once, instead of twice.\n5. Manually modify the generated code to include two 'foo' method invocations as parameters for the 'baz' method call."}
