{"id": "8142", "title": "Bug 8142: No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "I don't understand it. The issue is related to scoped type hierarchy on binary projects. When I try to view the class hierarchies of internal jars in 'org.apache.ant', I see the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, I'm confused about the meaning of the message.", "OB": "When I try to view the class hierarchies of internal jars in 'org.apache.ant', I see the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "I expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars in 'org.apache.ant'.", "SR": "1.
