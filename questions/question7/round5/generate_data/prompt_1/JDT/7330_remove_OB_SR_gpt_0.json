I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. It seems that currently the actions are distributed based on personal preferences, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor without forcing users to switch views.", "OB": "When selecting text, the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in any menu or the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available as one of the options in the context menu or the Edit menu when selecting text.", "SR": "1. Open the editor. 2. Select a block of text. 3. Verify if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available in the Edit menu. 4. If not, switch to the Outline view and verify if the action is available there."}
