{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED intWidget dispose() voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(' then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose.
