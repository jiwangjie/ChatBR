{"id": "4964", "title": "Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type \"(\" because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the \"(\", then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "OB": "When typing \"button.dispose\", automatic code assist inserts the wrong suggestion from the list without me explicitly selecting it.", "EB": "Automatic code assist should notice that I have typed a \"(\" and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". It should either prioritize case-sensitive suggestions or have a mechanism to determine the intended suggestion based on context.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Open the SWT code editor. \n2. Start typing \"button.dispose\" without looking at the code assist list. \n3. After typing \".dispose\", type \"(\" immediately. \n\nExpected behavior: \nAutomatic code assist should suggest \"dispose()\" instead of \"DISPOSED\" based on the context of the opening parenthesis."}
