{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "When performing the 'Move static member' operation in the dialog, there are several issues observed:\n\na. Mnemonics are missing for certain elements.\n\nb. The type field does not have any validation. It is important to validate the existence of the type because it is not too expensive to do so, considering it is already done in the type wizard for the superclass.\n\nc. The browse button is too small. It should be resized using SWTUtil to match the standard button sizes.\n\nd. The title is being used for displaying long text. When going to the next page, it incorrectly says 'Type not found'. This message should be changed to something more appropriate.\n\ne. The dialog shows types from all source folders, instead of only showing types from the source folders of the current project.\n\nf. The destination type can sometimes be the same as the source type. In such cases, the refactoring incorrectly warns that this will result in errors, when in fact it does not. Additionally, pseudochanges are made in all referencing classes.\n\nTo improve this:\n\na. The title of the dialog should be changed to 'Move static field(s)'.\n\nb. The description should be used to show the number of fields being moved and from which class(es).\n\nc. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.\n\n", "OB": "The browse button is too small and the title is used for displaying long text.

Open the dialog for 'Move static member'.\n2. Observe that the browse button is too small.\n3. Enter a long text in the title field.\n4.

Close the dialog.\n"}
