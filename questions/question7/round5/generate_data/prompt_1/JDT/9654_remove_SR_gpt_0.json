{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters - Dialog details", "description": "When modifying parameters in the dialog details, there are a few issues:\n\n1. Name validation is duplicated on the first page.\n2. The first and second columns could be merged.", "OB": "a. The buttons in the dialog are too small.\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is initially selected, but both move buttons are enabled.\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\nd. The dialog appears very large for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The marking between the button and the list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\nb. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\nc. Multiple selection should be allowed, as the move up / down actions can be applied to more than one item.\nd. The signature preview must be a label that wraps.\ne. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": "1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog.\n2. Verify the button sizes.\n3. Verify the initial selection behavior.\n4. Change a parameter name to something very long and verify the preview.\n5. Test the dialog with methods that have many parameters.\n6. Verify the marking between the button and the list.\n7. Check if the table has a label that can contain a mnemonic.\n8. Test the move up / down actions on multiple selected items.\n9. Ensure the signature preview is a label that wraps and has the background color set appropriately."}
