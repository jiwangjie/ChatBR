{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist list pops up. However, I do not notice it because I am not looking at the screen. The code assist list contains two items: 'DISPOSED' and 'dispose()'. I then mistakenly type '(' without realizing that the code assist is active. As soon as I type '(', the code assist inserts whatever is selected from the list. This behavior is not desirable.", "OB": "While typing 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist pops up and inserts 'button.DISPOSED' instead of 'button.dispose()'.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should notice that I have typed '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' better than 'DISPOSED'. It should insert 'button.dispose()' instead of 'button.DISPOSED'. Alternatively, the code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting code snippets.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open a SWT code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. When the code assist list appears, do not select anything.\n4. Type '('.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe automatic code assist should insert 'button.dispose()' instead of 'button.DISPOSED' when '(' is typed after 'button.dispose'.\n\nNote: This issue occurs in Build 204."}
