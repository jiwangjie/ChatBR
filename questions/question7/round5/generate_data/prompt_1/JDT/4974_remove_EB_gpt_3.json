{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after making changes to the project properties, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue arises from the fact that setting the output location and classpath are considered as two separate operations. By setting the first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
