{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Setting classpath and output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When I press Ok after setting the output location, I receive the following error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. It seems that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. By setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the settings menu. \n2. Select the 'Output Location' option. \n3. Set the output location to a nested folder within the source folder. \n4. Press Ok and observe the error message."}
