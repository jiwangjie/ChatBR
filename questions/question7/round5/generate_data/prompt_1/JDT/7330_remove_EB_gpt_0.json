Currently, we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view in order to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu when selecting text.", "EB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be available in the context menu when selecting text.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Select text in the editor. 2. Right-click to open the context menu and check if the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is available. If not, try accessing it via the Edit menu."}
