{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when the user types 'button.dispose', the code assist list is displayed but the user does not realize it because they are not looking at the screen.", "EB": "", "SR": "Build 204: \n1. Launch the application.\n2. Open the editor to write SWT code.\n3. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n4. Observe that the code assist list is displayed promptly.\n5. Notice that the code assist highlights 'dispose()' as the best match instead of 'DISPOSED'.\n6. Verify if the code assist is case sensitive, i.e., it does not automatically insert 'DISPOSED' if 'dispose' is not typed exactly as 'DISPOSE' with the same casing."}
