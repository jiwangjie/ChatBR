{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue is caused by the fact that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. Setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974 Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location at once. Additionally, the error message should be modified to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the application\n2. Navigate to the settings menu\n3. Set the output location and classpath as separate operations\n4. Press Ok\n5. Observe the error message displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'"}
