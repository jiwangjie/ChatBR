I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. We should distribute the actions in a way that is easily reachable for users from the editor without having to switch views.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu for text selection.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu for text selection.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not present in the context menu.\n5.
