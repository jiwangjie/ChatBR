Currently, the text in the second line moves, but it is unclear how this behavior is specified. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (removing the tab). Additionally, it is confusing when there is a stray space, as it is difficult to determine why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
