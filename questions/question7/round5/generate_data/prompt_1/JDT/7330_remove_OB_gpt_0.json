I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis, which causes confusion for users. It is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without forcing users to switch views.", "OB": "When I selected text in the editor, I did not see the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the Edit menu or any other global menu.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the Edit menu (or some other global menu).", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Select text in the editor. \n2. Check the Edit menu (or other global menus) to find the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action."}
