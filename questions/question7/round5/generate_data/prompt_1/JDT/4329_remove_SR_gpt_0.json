{"id": "4329", "title": "Bug 4329 - No results when searching via Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X)", "description": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are displayed. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly. The package view initializes the Search dialog with the fully qualified name, but this is not found when searching for declarations. In the case of Java search, it should first try to get the Java element. If that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are displayed. The Search dialog is initialized with the fully qualified name.", "EB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, the Search should display results.
