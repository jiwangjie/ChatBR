It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (i.e., remove the tab). However, it is confusing if there is a stray space, as it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Open a default text editor.  \n2. Type in the following: <space><tab>some text<tab>some text2.  \n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.  \n4. Observe that nothing moves."}
