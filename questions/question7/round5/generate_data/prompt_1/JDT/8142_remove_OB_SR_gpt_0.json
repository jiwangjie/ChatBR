I don't understand it.", "OB": "I am not able to view the class hierarchies of the internal jars when I select 'org.apache.ant' in the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project. Instead, I see the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars when I select 'org.apache.ant' in the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a binary project. 2. Navigate to the scoped type hierarchy. 3. Select 'org.apache.ant'. 4. Observe that no class hierarchies of the internal jars are displayed and the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant' is shown."}
