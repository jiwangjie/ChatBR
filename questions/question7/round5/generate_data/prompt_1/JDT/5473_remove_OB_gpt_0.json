In the given scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the first occurrence of a space character (i.e., the tab should be replaced with spaces). It is also confusing if there is a stray space, as it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a default text editor. 2. Type in the following: <space><tab>some text<tab>some text2. 3. Highlight the two lines and execute the ShiftLeft command. Notice that nothing moves."}
