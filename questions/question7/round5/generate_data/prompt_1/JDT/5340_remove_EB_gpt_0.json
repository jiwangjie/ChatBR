{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel adding an exception breakpoint in the breakpoints pane of the debug perspective, the progress dialog immediately closes. However, the exception list still appears, ignoring the cancellation request. It is expected that canceling the action should either stop the process or disable the cancel button. Currently, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the parameter for 'cancellable' is not set to false, which may be the cause of this issue.", "EB": "", "SR": "1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the '+' button to add an exception breakpoint. 3) In the progress dialog, click the 'Cancel' button."}
