{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 - ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "The ShiftLeft behavior is not working correctly when there are intermixed tabs and spaces in the text. Build 200110251.", "OB": "When I replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually and then execute ShiftLeft, the text does not move as expected. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). However, in this case, it is definitely confusing because there is a stray space, and I don't know why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a text editor.\n2. Enter text with intermixed tabs and spaces, such that the first line has a tab and the second line has spaces for indentation.\n3. Select the entire text.\n4. Use the ShiftLeft command.\n\nExpected behavior: The second line should be shifted to the left, and the first line should be shifted to the left at least to the space character (removing the tab character if necessary).\n\nActual behavior: The text does not shift as expected, and it is unclear why."}
