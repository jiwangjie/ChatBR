{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Currently, there is no confirmation or validation in place related to the output directory.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should display a confirmation message to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. This will prevent any issues caused by pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains files other than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Set the output folder to a bin directory.\n3. Verify if there is a confirmation message regarding the deletion and rebuilding of the output directory.\n4. Check if the confirmation message alerts the user about the presence of files other than .class files in the bin directory that can be rebuilt from the available .java files."}
