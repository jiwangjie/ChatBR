{"id": "4329", "title": "Bug 4329: No results when searching via Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X)", "description": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are displayed. However, when searching via the context menu in the packages view, it works as expected. Currently, the package view initializes the search dialog with the fully qualified name, which is not found when searching for declarations. The expected behavior is that the search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name. ", "OB": "The search dialog in the Package view, initialized with the fully qualified name, fails to find any results when searching for declarations.", "EB": "When searching for declarations using the Package view selection and dialog, the search should attempt to get the Java element and display the element name instead of the fully qualified name if it fails to find the fully qualified name.", "SR": "1. Open the Package view.\n2. Select a package.\n3. Right-click and select 'Search' from the context menu.\n4. In the search dialog, observe that the fully qualified name is displayed.\n5. Perform a search using the fully qualified name.\n6. Note that no search results are displayed.\n7. Repeat the above steps, but this time, the search dialog should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.\n8. Perform a search using the element name.\n9. Verify that the search results are displayed correctly."}
