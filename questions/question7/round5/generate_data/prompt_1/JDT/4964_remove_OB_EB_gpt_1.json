Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking.", "EB": "While writing SWT code, when I type \"button.dispose\", the code assist should suggest \"dispose()\" instead of selecting \"DISPOSED\".", "SR": "Build 204\n1. Open the code editor for SWT\n2. Type \"button.dispose\"\n3. Observe the code assist list and the selected suggestion"}
