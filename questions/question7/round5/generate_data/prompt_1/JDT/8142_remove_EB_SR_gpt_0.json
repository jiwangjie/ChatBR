{"id": "8142", "title": "Bug 8142: No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "I don't understand bug 8142. When I try to view the scoped type hierarchy in a binary project, specifically 'org.apache.ant', I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, can someone explain what this message means?", "OB": "When attempting to view the scoped type hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant' in a binary project, the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'' is displayed.", "EB": "When attempting to view the scoped type hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant' in a binary project, I expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars instead of the 'No declaration of selected members' message.", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, open a binary project and try to view the scoped type hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. See if the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'' is displayed instead of the expected class hierarchies."}
