{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in the report design, I see that the report design stores the absolute path of the library file. This is problematic as we need to save the relative path.", "EB": "", "SR": "To fix this bug, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path of the included library file. For example, if my report design is located at $project/test, and I include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, it should save the relative path as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary."}
