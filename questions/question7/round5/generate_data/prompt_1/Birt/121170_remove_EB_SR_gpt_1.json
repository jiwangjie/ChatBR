{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "The current implementation of the 'get column label' method in the meta data object does not return any user recognizable strings. This is problematic as it makes it difficult for users to understand the meaning and purpose of each column.", "OB": "Before extraction, the labels returned by the 'get column label' method are null. ", "EB": "After extraction, the 'get column label' method should return meaningful and recognizable strings that accurately describe the content of each column.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Create a new meta data object\n2. Call the 'get column label' method for any column\n3. Observe that the label returned is null\n4. Extract the meta data object\n5. Call the 'get column label' method for the same column\n6. Observe that a recognizable string is now returned as the label"}
