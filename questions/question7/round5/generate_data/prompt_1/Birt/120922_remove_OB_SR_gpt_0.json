{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "The 'Dirty Page' behavior in the XML Report Designer editor needs improvement. Currently, when the user makes changes to the source, a dialog pops up with the message 'Dirty Page' and the options to save, discard, or cancel the changes. However, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes). This is misleading and should be changed. Additionally, other pages cannot be accessed until the source is saved, making it inconvenient for the user. The dialog needs to be more user-friendly and provide clearer instructions on how to save or discard the changes.", "OB": "When making changes to the source in XML Report Designer editor, a dialog pops up with the message 'Dirty Page' and the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'.", "EB": "Instead of the current dialog, a better approach would be to display a dialog with a more specific and relevant title, such as 'Save Changes'. The options should be clearer, for example, 'Save', 'Discard', and 'Cancel'. The dialog should also provide explicit instructions on how to save or discard the changes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the XML Report Designer editor. 2. Make changes to the source. 3. Observe the 'Dirty Page' dialog and its options. "}
