Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design file.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Check the property settings for the included library.\nExpected Behavior:\n- The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path for the included library.\n- For example, if the report design is located in $project/test, including a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary should result in the relative path being stored."}
