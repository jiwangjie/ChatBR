{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When including a library in the report design, the absolute path of the library file is being stored instead of the relative path. For example, in the property section of the report design, the absolute path is being shown as 'fileName/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "", "SR": "To fix this bug, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path of the included library. For instance, if the report design is located at $project/test and the library is located at $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be stored as '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'."}
