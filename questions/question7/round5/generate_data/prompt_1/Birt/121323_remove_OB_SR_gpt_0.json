This means that if the dialog is closed and reopened, the previously set filter is no longer applied.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist filter information so that users do not have to set the filter every time they open the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Set a filter using the provided options. \n3. Close the dialog. \n4. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n\nExpected behavior: The previously set filter should still be applied in the dialog."}
