{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily amount to several hundred tables. Currently, with the code from CVS on 6/30/05, the schema filter is present, but there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed.", "EB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers should only load and display tables and columns on demand, instead of loading the entire schema tree on load.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Notice that the tree control on load displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables.\n3. The warning message is displayed due to the tree being populated on load.\n4. Rewrite the code to only load and display tables and columns on demand, instead of loading the entire schema tree on load."}
