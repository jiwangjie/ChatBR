{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not persisting the filter information when an XPath expression is entered for the column mapping.", "OB": "Currently, when a user enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information, including the XPath expression with the selection part, so that when leaving the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is not lost.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as section[@id='left']. \n3. Close the dialog. \n4. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog again. \n\nExpected behavior: The entered XPath expression with the selection part is still displayed and not lost when reopening the dialog."}
