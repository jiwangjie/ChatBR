{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Even though there is a schema filter in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, there is still a warning message on load because the entire schema is being queried and loaded. This process takes a long time and eventually displays the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform, when opening the data set editor, the entire schema is queried and loaded. This process takes a long time and eventually displays the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "The data set editor should load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying and loading the entire schema on load.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers. Wait for the entire schema to be queried and loaded, and observe the warning message and the limitation of the available list to only 500 items."}
