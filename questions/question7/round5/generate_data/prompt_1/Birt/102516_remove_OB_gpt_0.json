The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' appears.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Observe that the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait.\n\nTo verify the fix:\n1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Expand the tree or apply a filter.\n3. Verify that the tables and columns are loaded on demand."}
