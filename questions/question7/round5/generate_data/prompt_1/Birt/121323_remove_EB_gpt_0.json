{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. In my opinion, treating XPath expressions in this way will lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap when clicked on OK or Apply.", "SR": "1.
