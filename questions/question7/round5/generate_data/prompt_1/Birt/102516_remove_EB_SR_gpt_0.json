{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Although there is a schema filter, it doesn't prevent the warning message from appearing on load because the tree is being populated on load.\n\nThe expected behavior is that the tree control should only load the tables and columns when requested or when the user applies a schema filter. This will improve the performance and usability of the JDBC Data Set Editor."}
