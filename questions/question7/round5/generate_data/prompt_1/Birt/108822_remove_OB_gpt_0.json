{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic expected for disk sorting when border value exists for row value", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for processing disk sorting does not handle border values for row values efficiently. It is observed that when there is a border value for row value, the sorting operation becomes slow and inefficient.", "EB": "A more efficient logic needs to be implemented to process disk sorting when there is a border value for row value. Instead of saving the file as a temp file, the data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Sort 40,000 rows of data on disk.\n2. Set the program to process data of less than 40,000 rows.\n3. Observe the following operations performed by the program:\n   a. Save the file as a temp file.\n   b. Call the file into memory.\n   c. Sort the data in memory.\n   d. Save the sorted data to a temp file."}
