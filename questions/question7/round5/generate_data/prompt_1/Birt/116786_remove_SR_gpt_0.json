{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path for library includes. For example, <property name=\"fileName\">/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>. This should be changed to store the relative path instead.", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, and the library is located at $project/test/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be stored as lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Verify that the library's path is stored as a relative path."}
