Additionally, the OK button should be grayed out after step 5.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Set the default value of the report parameter as 'aaa' in the list box. 2. Modify the default value to 'bbb'. 3. Observe that the default value is lost and there is no value set in the list box. 4. Click on the OK button and observe that it can still be used, despite the absence of a default value. 5. Change the Display type to Combo Box. 6. After step 5, observe that the default value 'aaa' is still not set and the OK button is still usable."}
