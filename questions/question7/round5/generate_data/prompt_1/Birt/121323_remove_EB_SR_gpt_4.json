{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The bug occurs when entering an XPath expression with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog. In the class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost. This behavior causes trouble when working with XPath expressions.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part in the column mapping field, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Leave the dialog and observe that the filter information is lost in the RelationInformation class."}
