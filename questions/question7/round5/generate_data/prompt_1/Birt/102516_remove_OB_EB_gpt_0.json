The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, all the tables and columns are loaded automatically which causes a delay and leads to a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, meaning that they should be loaded only when the user requests them, instead of loading all the tables and columns at once.", "SR": "1. Open the data set editor. \n2. Check if tables and columns are loading automatically or not. \n3. Ensure that tables and columns are loaded only on-demand when the user requests them. \n4. Verify that the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is not displayed."}
