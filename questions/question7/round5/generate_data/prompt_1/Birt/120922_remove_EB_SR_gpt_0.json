The current error message is not clear.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the changes need to be saved. The user is required to take action to save or discard the changes.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when switching back to the Layout view, a prompt should be displayed clearly indicating that the user needs to save or discard the changes. The error message should provide clear instructions on how to proceed.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open a report in XML Report Designer. 2. Make changes to the XML in the 'source' view. 3.
