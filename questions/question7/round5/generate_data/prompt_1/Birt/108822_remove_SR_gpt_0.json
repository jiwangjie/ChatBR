Instead of processing the data on disk, it should sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Set the program to process less than 40000 rows of data. 2. Sort the data on disk. 3. Observe the sorting operation and check if the logic is inefficient."}
