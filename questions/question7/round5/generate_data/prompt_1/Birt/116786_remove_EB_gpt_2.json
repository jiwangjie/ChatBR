Instead, it should save the relative path.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a report design in BIRT designer.\n2. Include a library in the report design.\n3. Check the property for the included library.\n\nExpected behavior: The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path for the included library. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test and the library is located in $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary."}
