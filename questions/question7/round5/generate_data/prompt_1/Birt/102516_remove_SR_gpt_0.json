{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. The code from CVS as of 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message being displayed on load because the tree is being populated immediately.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed. The schema filter in the code does not prevent the warning message from appearing on load, as the tree is still being populated immediately.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter, to avoid displaying the warning message on load.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers.\n2. Observe that the tree control displays every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being shown.\n3. Apply a filter to the tree control and observe that a warning message is displayed on load."}
