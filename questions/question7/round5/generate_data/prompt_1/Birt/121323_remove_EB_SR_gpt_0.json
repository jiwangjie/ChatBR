{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior is problematic as XPath expressions should be preserved in order to avoid potential issues.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
