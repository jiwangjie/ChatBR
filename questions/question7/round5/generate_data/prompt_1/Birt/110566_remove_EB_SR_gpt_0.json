Set a filter in the dataset with 'row[0] equals to '\n2. Click on the Preview tab.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The first result record returned when previewing correctly reflects the filter expression set.\n- As per the developer, 'row[0]' can only be generated after all the data has been fetched, so it should not be taken as a valid filter expression."}
