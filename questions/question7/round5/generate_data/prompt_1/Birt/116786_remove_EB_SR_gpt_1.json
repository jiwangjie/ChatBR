However, we should save the relative path instead.\n\n<property name='fileName' value='/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>\n<property name='namespace' value='lib1'/>.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the report design should store the relative path for library inclusion.\n\n<property name='fileName' value='../../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>\n<property name='namespace' value='lib1'/>.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the report design that includes a library.\n2. Check the path specified in the <property name='fileName' value='...'/> tag.\n\nTo validate the fix:\n1. Open the report design that includes a library.\n2. Verify that the path specified in the <property name='fileName' value='...'/> tag is a relative path and not an absolute path."}
