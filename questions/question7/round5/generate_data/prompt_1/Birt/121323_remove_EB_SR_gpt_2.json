{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression contains a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. This behavior can cause trouble if XPath expressions are treated in this way.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping that includes a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left'].\n3. Take note of the selection being stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Verify that the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign.\n6. Verify that the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is retained after leaving the dialog."}
