{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "", "OB": "The labels returned before extraction are null, while the ones after extraction are recognizable strings.", "EB": "When using the 'getcolumnlabel' function from the meta data object, it should return user recognizable strings. Currently, before the extraction process, the function returns null labels, which is incorrect. The expected behavior is for the 'getcolumnlabel' function to return the same labels before and after the extraction process, as these labels are used for display to the end user.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Obtain the meta data object. 2. Call the 'getcolumnlabel' function before the extraction process. 3. Note the null labels returned by the function. 4. Proceed with the extraction process. 5. Call the 'getcolumnlabel' function again. 6. Observe that recognizable strings are returned after the extraction. The expected behavior is for the 'getcolumnlabel' function to return recognizable strings both before and after the extraction process."}
