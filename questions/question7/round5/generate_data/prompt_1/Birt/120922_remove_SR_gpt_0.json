This problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very clear. The error message is \"Source page is dirty.\"", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog with a clear title indicating that the XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog should not have quotes in its title.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Edit the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor.\n3.
