{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'] in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior is causing inconvenience.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information along with the XPath expression for the column mapping. It would be more convenient to use the plain XPath expression (prepended with the path from the data set selector itself) and allow filtering to be something optional for those who need it.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part. 3. Verify that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. 4. Leave the dialog and observe that the data stored in filterInfo is lost. "}
