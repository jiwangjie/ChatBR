{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include stores absolute path instead of relative path", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer currently generates and saves the library path as an absolute path. For example, if the report design is saved in the folder $project/test, and the library is in the folder $project/lib, the absolute path to the library is saved as $project/lib. This causes issues when the report design is moved to a different location.", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path to the library. In the above example, the relative path should be saved as ../lib, so that it can be correctly resolved regardless of the location of the report design.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Add a library to the report design.\n4. Save the report design in a different location.\n5. Check the path to the included library in the report design and ensure it is saved as a relative path."}
