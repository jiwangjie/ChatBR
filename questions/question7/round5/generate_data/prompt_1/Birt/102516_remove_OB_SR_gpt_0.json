The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, the tables and columns are loaded immediately when the page is loaded. However, this can lead to performance issues for large data sources. It would be more efficient if the loading of the tree can be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "Currently, the tables and columns are loaded immediately when the page is loaded.", "EB": "The tables and columns should be loaded only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Verify that the tables and columns are not loaded immediately.\n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter and verify that the tables and columns are loaded as needed."}
