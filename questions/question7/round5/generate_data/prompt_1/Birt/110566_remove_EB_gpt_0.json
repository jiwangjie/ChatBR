Set a filter in the data set with 'row[0] equals to '\n2. Click on the Preview tab.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nThe first result record returned when previewing the data set is incorrect.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nAs the developer mentioned, 'row[0]' can only be generated after all the data is fetched. Thus, 'row[0]' should not be used as a filter expression.", "OB": "The first result record returned when previewing the data set is incorrect.", "EB": "As the developer mentioned, 'row[0]' can only be generated after all the data is fetched.
