{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744 - Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "The report displays the same results whether I set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML.", "EB": "The report should display different results depending on the dynamic text element's Content Type property. Specifically:\n\n- For Plain, the literal content (tags and all) should be displayed.\n- For Auto, content 1, 2, and 3 should appear properly without HTML or RTF tags.\n- For HTML, content 1 and 2 should appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 should appear literally with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n\n1. Have a database field with three types of content:\n   a) HTML text within <html>...</html> tag.\n   b) HTML fragments not within <html> tag.\n   c) Text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field.\n3. Set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to different values (Auto, Plain, or HTML).\n4. Observe the displayed results in the report attached."}
