{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page displays text fields instead of labels", "description": "Integration build 09/17 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. This issue affects all motif platforms and the current implementation looks bad.", "OB": "Currently, the Project Properties Info page displays certain fields as text fields instead of labels. The fields are editable, which is not intended. It appears that this implementation was done to allow the user to select and copy the values, but this behavior is not required.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should display the fields as read-only labels instead of text fields. This will improve the visual presentation and prevent unintended editing of the values.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Project Properties window. \n2. Navigate to the Info page. \n3. Verify that certain fields are displayed as editable text fields instead of read-only labels, such as [insert specific field names]."}
