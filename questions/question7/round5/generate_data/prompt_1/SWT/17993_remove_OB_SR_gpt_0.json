{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When performing a find/replace operation, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history. This behavior is not desired.", "EB": "The find/replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. The feature should respect the case of what the user types.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Perform a find/replace action by selecting Edit -> Find/Replace...\n3. Verify that the typed entry is not replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Repeat the steps for the 'Replace With' field to ensure consistent behavior."}
