Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. \n\nHowever, if I repeat steps 1 and 2, and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "I expected that reverting the file contents would not take longer than closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1.
