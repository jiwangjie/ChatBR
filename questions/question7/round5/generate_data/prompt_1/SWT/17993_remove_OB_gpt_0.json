{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to the autocomplete feature commonly found in browsers. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be implemented. For now, I believe the behavior should be changed to allow for a wider range of find and replace operations while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I suggest removing this feature.

The 'Find' and 'Replace With' fields should allow the user to perform a full range of find and replace operations, while still maintaining the case sensitivity of the entered text.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a document so that the 'Edit -> Find/Replace...' option becomes available.\n2. Try typing 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Attempt to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. The entered value should not be replaced with the value from the history."}
