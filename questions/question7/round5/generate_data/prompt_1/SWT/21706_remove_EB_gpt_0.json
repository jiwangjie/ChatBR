However, this method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. As a result, there is an issue in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "The line mentioned above should be changed to: static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); This change will remove the reflection usage and should have the same functionality as before.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use the CLDC version of SWT and run a program that utilizes the BidiUtil class with the aforementioned line of code. The NoClassDefFoundError should be thrown in this case. After applying the suggested code change, the program should run without any errors."}
