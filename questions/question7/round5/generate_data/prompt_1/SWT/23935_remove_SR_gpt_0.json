{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. This is because the text widget is a child of the tree, which causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "To reproduce the issue, run the attached code with build 20020920. The left tree and text should behave as expected on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "1. Launch the application with the provided code.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gains focus, but the text widget does not lose focus."}
