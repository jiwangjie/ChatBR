{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the F1 build, the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from previous searches. If it finds a match, it replaces what has been typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, which means that the case of what has been typed may be changed to match the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The current behavior of Find/Replace should be changed to something more simple, allowing the full range of find and replace operations to be performed while still respecting the case of what the user types. However, until then, I think the feature should be removed. For me, it is very common to perform find and replace operations and the current behavior is not suitable.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document. \n2. Access the Edit menu and click on 'Find/Replace...'. \n3. In the Find field, type a string that matches a previous search entry in the history. \n4. Observe that the typed entry is replaced with the value from the history. \n5. Repeat the steps for the Replace With field and observe the similar behavior."}
