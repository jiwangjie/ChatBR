{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell.The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating thetext editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when clicking on the tree, the text widget should lose focus on Linux as it does on Windows.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a text widget as a child of a tree widget on Linux. 2. Click anywhere in the tree. 3. Observe that the text widget does not lose focus."}
