{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled and movable but they do not have any effect. Even when opening a small image such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they do not have any functionality.", "EB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars should be disabled and not movable, as they do not have any effect when used. This will eliminate the confusion caused by movable but non-functional scrollbars.", "SR": "1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Verify that the scrollbars are disabled and not movable regardless of the size of the image being analyzed."}
