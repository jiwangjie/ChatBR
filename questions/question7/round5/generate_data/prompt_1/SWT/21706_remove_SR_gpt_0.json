Specifically, there is a line in the `BidiUtil` class: `static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);` The `BidiUtil.class` is used as syntactic sugar for `Class.forName(\"org...BidiUtil\")`.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to remove the usage of `Class.forName()` and instead add a private constructor. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, it would be appropriate to have a private constructor. This change will prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class and will not add any additional size.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue and verify the change, follow these steps:\n1. Open the source code for the `BidiUtil` class on win32 platform.\n2. Locate the line: `static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);`\n3. Replace the line with a private constructor: `private BidiUtil() {}`.\n4. Recompile the code and ensure that there are no compiler errors.\n5. Verify that the issue with `NoClassDefFoundError` is no longer present when using the CLDC version of SWT."}
