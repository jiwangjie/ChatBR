Integration build 09/17. The current design looks fine on Windows, but on motif platforms, such as Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these text fields have automatic borders which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out even more.", "OB": "On motif platforms, such as Solaris/AIX/HPUX, the text fields on the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, identifying them as user input targets. Additionally, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more.", "EB": "On all platforms, including motif platforms such as Solaris/AIX/HPUX, the Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. Instead, a different UI component, such as labels or read-only text areas, should be used to display the information.", "SR": "1. Open the Project Properties dialog on any motif platform, such as Solaris/AIX/HPUX.\n2. Navigate to the Info page.\n3.
