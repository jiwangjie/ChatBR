Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only). 2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example. 3. Note that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved around, but they do not have any effect. 4. Open a small image, such as an icon, and observe that the scrollbars are misleading, as they do not perform any scrolling."}
