However, on motif platforms, these text fields have automatic borders, which makes them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds which makes them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should be created as readonly Text fields instead of regular input fields with borders. This change would make them look like labels. It seems like the reason for the current implementation might be to allow users to select and copy the values from these fields.", "SR": "1. Open the Project Properties dialog.\n2. Navigate to the Info page.\n3. Observe the text fields on the motif platforms, such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX."}
