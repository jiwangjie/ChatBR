{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature in this software is that it replaces the typed entry with a value from the search history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is commonly seen in browsers. However, it would be more desirable if the typed entry is not automatically replaced and instead a full autocomplete feature is implemented in the future.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and automatically replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the search history.", "SR": "1. Open the software and choose the 'Edit' menu.\n2. Select 'Find/Replace...'\n3. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n4. Click on 'Find'.\n5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."}
