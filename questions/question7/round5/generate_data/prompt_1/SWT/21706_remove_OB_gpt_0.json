Since there are no non-static methods in this class, it is unnecessary for anyone to instantiate the class. By making the constructor private, we prevent people from instantiating the class unnecessarily. This change will not add any size to the class as the compiler provides a default public constructor. This change is recommended to improve the code structure.", "SR": "To make the necessary changes, modify the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), 'windowProc', 4);\nPlease note that although I haven't personally tested this change, it should have the same functionality as before."}
