{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature in the F1 build is replacing the typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers, but it may not be suitable for all scenarios. It would be better if what the user types is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered. Currently, this behavior is causing difficulties in performing find or replace operations.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds a match, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by selecting Edit -> Find/Replace...\n2. Type something in either the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields\n3. Verify that the typed entry is not replaced with a value from the history"}
