This is because there are no nonstatic methods in the class, so there is no need to instantiate it. Making the constructor private would prevent people from instantiating the class, which is not necessary. Adding a private constructor will not increase the size of the class, as the compiler automatically adds a public constructor. Instead, it will enforce the intended behavior by making the constructor private.", "SR": "The bug report does not provide any information about the steps to reproduce the issue."}
