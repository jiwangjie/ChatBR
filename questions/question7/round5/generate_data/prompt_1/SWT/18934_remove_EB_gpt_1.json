They should not be movable and should not have any effect when trying to scroll.", "SR": "Build F2 (20020602)\nRedhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only)\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Check the scrollbars to ensure they are enabled.\n3. Attempt to move the scrollbars and observe that they do not have any effect.\n4.
