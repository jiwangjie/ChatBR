{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of Find/Replace is such that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from previous searches and replaces what is typed with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. It would be better if what is typed is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields in the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...), the application automatically searches for entries from previous searches. If it finds a matching entry, it replaces what is typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, resulting in a change in the case of what is typed to match the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields in the Find/Replace dialog, the application should not automatically replace what is typed with a value from the history. The user input should remain as is, allowing for uninterrupted find or replace operations.", "SR": "1. Launch the application with F1 build.\n2. Open the Find/Replace dialog by navigating to Edit -> Find/Replace...\n3. In the dialog, locate the 'Find' field.\n4. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n5. Click 'Find'.\n6. Attempt to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."}
