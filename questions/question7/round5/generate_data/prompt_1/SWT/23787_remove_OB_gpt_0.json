{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "The project properties info page in the properties dialog is currently using text fields instead of labels. This is causing the page to look bad on all motif platforms in the integration build 09/17.", "OB": "When selecting a project and right-clicking to open the properties dialog, navigating to the info page, I observed that the fields for path, type, etc. are displayed as editable text fields instead of readonly labels. As a result, users can modify the values in these fields.", "EB": "The fields for path, type, etc. should be displayed as readonly labels instead of editable text fields to ensure consistency in the interface and prevent users from accidentally modifying the values.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select a project, right-click to open the properties dialog, and navigate to the info page. On this page, observe that the fields for path, type, etc. are displayed as editable text fields instead of readonly labels."}
