{"id": "14047", "title": "Bug 14047 - StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap", "description": "The StyledText component is experiencing inefficient redraws when there is a change in the text and word wrap is enabled.", "OB": "During a text change with word wrap enabled, the StyledText component is not efficiently redrawing. This can be observed by adding the following line to the `StyledText.performPaint` method: `System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);`", "EB": "During a text change with word wrap enabled, the StyledText component should efficiently redraw to prevent unnecessary performance impact. The `performPaint` method needs to be optimized to avoid unnecessary redraws.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Enable word wrap in the StyledText component.\n2. Make a text change.\n3. Observe the redraws occurring by adding the line `System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);` to the `StyledText.performPaint` method."}
