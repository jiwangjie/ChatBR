{"id": "6656", "title": "Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "On linux, running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000). When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "OB": "When the Navigator view is resized smaller on Linux using build 20011127, the tool items including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) move below the label. This behavior is not observed in build 20011116 on Nt2000.", "EB": "The tool items, specifically the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), should stay on the same line as the label regardless of how small the view is resized. Users are accustomed to the close button being located to the far right corner and on the same line as the label.", "SR": "1. Launch the application on Linux using build 20011127.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view smaller and observe the position of the tool items including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon.\nExpected: The tool items should stay on the same line as the label and not move below it."}
