The file should not open in the second editor and instead, a warning message should be displayed notifying the user that opening the file again may result in overwriting any changes made in the first editor. The user should be given the option to continue opening the file or cancel the operation.", "EB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, if the user tries to open the same file in another editor (using the 'Open With' option and selecting the System Editor), a warning message should be displayed.
