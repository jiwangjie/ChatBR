Go to the Java Perspective, and open a java file by double-clicking on it. The file should now be opened in the workbench. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' \u2192 'System Editor'. Expected behavior is for a warning message to be displayed, informing the user that their changes may be overwritten and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be shown, indicating that all files need to be closed before opening the file in a different editor. We believe this is a safety feature where WSAD doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "However, the expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed.", "SR": "1.
