{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Bug 3970 - The Windows workstations are used as X terminals to run Eclipse (since PC are cheaper than Unix boxes). Currently, when a new file is created on Windows, it does not have the correct Unix line delimiters. We need a UI in the preferences section to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values for the line delimiter should include DOS/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be provided by the Workbench so that all plugins use the same line delimiter for new files.", "OB": "When a new file is created on Windows, it currently has the wrong line delimiters. The end product is a Unix product, so even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters.", "EB": "When a new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters, in order to match the end product which is a Unix product. We should provide a UI in the preferences for users to define the line delimiter for new files. The UI should allow users to choose between DOS/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter.", "SR": "To replicate the issue, follow these steps: 1. Have both a Unix and Windows workstation used to develop a Unix product/program. 2. Create a new file on Windows. 3. Check the line delimiters in the new file, they should be different and incorrect for a Unix product."}
