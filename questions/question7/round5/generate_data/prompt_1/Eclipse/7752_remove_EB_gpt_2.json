{"id": "7752", "title": "Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select File -> Export and select 'Zip File' to export\n\nObserved behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same file name under different directories to a zip file fails. In the 'Export' dialog window, when both projects are selected and a zip file name is provided (such as 'test.zip'), an error message box pops up stating that problems were encountered during export. The error detail lists the file with the same name in 'project2' as the problem.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe export process should complete successfully without any error messages. The resulting zip file should contain all the selected files without any conflicts or issues.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select File -> Export and select 'Zip File' to export"}
