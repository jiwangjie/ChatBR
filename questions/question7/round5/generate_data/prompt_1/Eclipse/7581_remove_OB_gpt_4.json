{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The issue is that the combo box in the property sheet does not size correctly. When any of the strings in the combo box options is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box extends to accommodate the widest option. However, the drop-down button remains fixed on the right edge of the column. As a result, the drop-down button may be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet, leading to a poor user experience.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always match the width of the property sheet column, ensuring that the drop-down button is always visible. This behavior should be consistent with the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit objects using the row with name-value pairs in two columns.\n3. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create ComboBoxCellEditor for column two.\n4. Include strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor constructor.\n5. Observe that if any string is wider than the property sheet column, the combo box expands to fit the widest string, potentially causing the drop-down button to be clipped."}
