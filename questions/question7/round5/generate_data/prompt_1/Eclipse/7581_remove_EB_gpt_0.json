{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in property sheet", "description": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the PropertySheetViewer does not size correctly in the property sheet. If any of the strings in the combo box are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item. As a result, the drop down button may be positioned too far to the right and get clipped outside the visible area of the property sheet. This is problematic for the user as they cannot see the combo drop down button without widening the property sheet view.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the PropertySheetViewer does not size correctly in the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should automatically adjust its size to fit the content of the property sheet column, ensuring that the drop down button remains fully visible within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet containing a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n2. Ensure that one of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n3. Notice that the drop down button is positioned too far to the right and gets clipped outside the visible area of the property sheet.\n4. Try to interact with the drop down button, observe that it is not fully visible."}
