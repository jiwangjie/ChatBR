{"id": "7752", "title": "Exporting multiple files with the same name from different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., \"foo.txt\")\n3. From the main menu, select File > Export and choose Zip File\n4. In the Export dialog window, select both projects, give the zip file a name (e.g., \"test.zip\"), and begin the export to a zip file.\n\nObserved behavior:\nWhen exporting multiple files with the same name from different directories to a zip file, an error message box pops up. The error message states that problems were encountered during export, and the details section lists the file with the same name from the second project as the issue.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe export process should complete successfully without any errors, and all files with the same name should be included in the zip file under their respective directories.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.
