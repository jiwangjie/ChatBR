Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files. \n\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the java file opened. Close it. \n\n3. Go to the Java Perspective and open a java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file should now be opened in the workbench. \n\n4. Now, right-click on the java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. \n\nThe expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed in the workbench stating that changes may be overwritten and prompt the user to continue, or an error message should be displayed requiring all files to be closed before opening a new one. However, in the observed behavior, nothing happens and no warning or error message is displayed."}
