", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. ", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this issue is caused by us or by SWT library.
