{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes. However, even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product.", "OB": "Currently, when a new file is created on Windows using Eclipse, it has Windows line delimiters instead of Unix line delimiters.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a new file is created on Windows using Eclipse, it should have Unix line delimiters.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiters used in the new file.\n\nExpected result:\nThe new file should have Unix line delimiters.\n\nAdditional notes:\nThere should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench that allows users to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values for line delimiters should include Dos/Window, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be used by all plugins to ensure consistent line delimiters for new files."}
