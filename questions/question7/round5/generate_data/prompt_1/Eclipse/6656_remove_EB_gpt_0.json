However, both the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. If these icons start moving around, it is possible that users will become confused.", "EB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller on Linux, running build 20011127 (this issue does not occur on build 20011116 on Nt2000), the close button should remain in its original position and not move down with the tool items.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:   1. Open build 20011127 on Linux.  2. Resize a view such as the Navigator to be smaller.  3. Observe that the tool items and the close button move down below the label."}
