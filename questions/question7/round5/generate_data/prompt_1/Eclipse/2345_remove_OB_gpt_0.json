Open a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml' in the project.\n3. By default, the 'scripted resource editor example' is used to open XML files.\n4. Select the 'test.xml' file in the Navigator.\n5. Right-click on the file and choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'.\n6. Observe that nothing happens and the 'scripted resource editor example' remains active.\n\nTo verify the fix:\n\n1. Follow the same steps as above.\n2. After choosing 'Open With... / Default Text Editor', a new editor for the file should be opened, as the editor type is different.\n\nNOTES:\n- Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types."}
