", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. The width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box to always be the same width as the property sheet column. It should work similarly to the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Select a cell with a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Note that the width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column."}
