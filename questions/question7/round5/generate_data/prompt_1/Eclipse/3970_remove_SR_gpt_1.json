However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. A UI should be provided in the Workbench preferences to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for the line delimiter should include Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter used for the new file. It should match the line delimiter defined in the preferences."}
