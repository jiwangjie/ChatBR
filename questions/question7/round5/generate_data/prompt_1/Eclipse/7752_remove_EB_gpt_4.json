{"id": "7752", "title": "Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select File -> Export and choose 'Zip File' to export\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects, give the zip file a name (e.g., 'test.zip'), and click on the 'Export' button\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up indicating that there were problems encountered during export, and the details list the file of the same name in 'project2' as the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe exported zip file should be successfully created without any errors, containing all the files from both projects.\n\n"}
