System Editor', nothing happens. The expected behavior is that the workbench should display a warning message indicating that opening the file in another editor may result in overwritten changes, and give the option to continue or display an error message stating that all files need to be closed first. This behavior is believed to be a safety feature in WSAD that prevents external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Close all open files in the workbench.\n2. Go to the Java Perspective.\n3. Double-click on a Java file to open it in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the Java file.\n5. Select 'Open With .. System Editor'.\n6. Observe if a warning message is displayed regarding potential overwritten changes or if an error message is displayed requiring all files to be closed first."}
