The icon has also changed from the parent Java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When saving a file using the SaveAs feature, the file is saved without a file extension. The Navigator shows the file without any file extension.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file unless explicitly changed. The Navigator should display the file with the correct file extension.", "SR": "1) Open an existing Java file. \n2) Make some modifications to the file (e.g., move an existing class). \n3) Click the SaveAs icon which is located next to the Save Icon. A dialog will appear. \n4) Browse for a valid container location. \n5) Enter the filename without specifying the file extension since it is not requested. \n6) Click Ok.\n\nObserve that the Navigator has added the file in the specified location, but the file does not have a file extension displayed."}
