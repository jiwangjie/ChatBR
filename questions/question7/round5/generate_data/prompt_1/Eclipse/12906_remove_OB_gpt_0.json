However, no error message is displayed when this action is performed.", "OB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, there is no indication or warning when trying to open it in another editor.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning or error message displayed, indicating that the file is already opened in another editor and cannot be opened again.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double-click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the Java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected Result: The workbench should display a warning message stating that you may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue, or an error message stating that you should close all files first. This is believed to be a safety feature where the IDE doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in the IDE."}
