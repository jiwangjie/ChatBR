{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.", "EB": "The system should provide a dialog box with the message 'Do you want to save your file?' and options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' (which halts the shutdown).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. Notice that the text file is marked as dirty.\n3. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shutdown/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected results:\nA warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their dirty file(s) before the computer is shut down/rebooted.\n\nActual results:\nThere is no warning or question message box, and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately without a chance to save the dirty file(s).\n\nNote: Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) provide similar warnings before shutting down."}
