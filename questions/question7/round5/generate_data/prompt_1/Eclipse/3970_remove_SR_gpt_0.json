{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes). When creating a new file, we currently use the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). However, this may not always be what the user wants. Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values should include Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench, so that all plugins can use the same line delimiter for new files. Notes:"}
