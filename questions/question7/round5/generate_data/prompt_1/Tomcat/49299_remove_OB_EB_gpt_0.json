Despite setting a custom cookie name, the default 'jsessionid' is still used for URL rewriting.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a custom cookie name is set, it should be used for URL rewriting instead of the default 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue: \n1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file\n2. Access the application using the URL: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/"}
