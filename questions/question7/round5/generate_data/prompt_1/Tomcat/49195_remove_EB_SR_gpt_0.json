That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat stops but prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nIt is just a message and does not affect the actual shutdown process. After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() function performs System.exit(1), which results in Tomcat shutdown. When the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Configure a Windows service with Tomcat. \n2. In the server.xml file, specify <Server port='1'. \n3.
