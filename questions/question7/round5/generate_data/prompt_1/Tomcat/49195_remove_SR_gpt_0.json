{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Shutdown port with value 1 in server.xml prints error message", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, Tomcat prints an error message stating that no shutdown port is configured. However, this message does not prevent Tomcat from shutting down. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() method performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await() so that it can be awakened by a notifyAll() call or interrupted using interrupt() method.", "OB": "When using a shutdown port value of 1 in server.xml, Tomcat prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Regardless of this message, Tomcat stops properly. It should be noted that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the 'Catalina server' is not null.", "EB": "Even when using a shutdown port value of 1, Tomcat should not print an error message stating that no shutdown port is configured. Instead, it should gracefully shutdown without any error messages.", "SR": "1. Open the Tomcat configuration file (server.xml)\n2. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the file\n3. Start Tomcat\n4. Check the catalina.20100427.log file and confirm that the error message 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' is printed\n5. Verify that Tomcat shuts down properly despite the error message"}
