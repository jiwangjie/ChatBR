That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried. ", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, it works but prints an error message. The error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file and states: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, the server actually stops despite this message. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() function performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server object is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling the Catalina.stop() function."}
