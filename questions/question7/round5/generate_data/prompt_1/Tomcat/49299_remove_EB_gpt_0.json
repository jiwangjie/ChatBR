The observed behavior shows that the custom cookie name mentioned in the specification is not actually used for URL rewriting. The provided attachment cookiename.war is a reproduction case. ", "OB": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled). However, the actual result observed is that the page sets the cookie with a different name, MYSESSIONCOOKIE, and the URL for the Reload link uses the default name 'jsessionid'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that if a custom name for session tracking cookies is configured, it should also be used as the name of the URI parameter when session id is encoded in the URL, assuming URL rewriting is enabled.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Deploy the provided cookiename.war file 2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/3/. Verify that the custom cookie name is not used in the URL rewriting process."}
