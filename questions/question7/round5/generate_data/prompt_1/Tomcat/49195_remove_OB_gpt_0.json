However, an error message is printed. There could be improvements in the way Tomcat is stopped, such as using wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in the StandardServer.await() method and using notifyAll() or interrupt() to wake the thread.", "OB": "When starting and stopping the Tomcat service with port 1 specified as the shutdown port in the server.xml file, the service functions properly. However, an error message is displayed during the shutdown process.", "EB": "During the shutdown process of the Tomcat service with port 1 specified as the shutdown port, no error message should be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server using an OS signal or by calling the Catalina.stop() method."}
