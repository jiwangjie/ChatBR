{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml file of Tomcat, the Windows service stops successfully but prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat actually stops as expected.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.\n\nThere could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat, as currently, the System.exit(0) command is used regardless of the server's state. This behavior could also be observed when using jsvc, although this has not been tested.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, Tomcat stops successfully but prints the error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' in the catalina.20100427.log file.", "EB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, Tomcat should stop successfully without printing any error message in the catalina.20100427.log file.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Attempt to shut down the server through an OS signal or by calling the 'Catalina.stop()' method."}
