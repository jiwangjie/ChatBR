{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, this bug affects version 7.0.0 of Tomcat as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented by having separate methods Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start(). However, in the current implementation, the fix for BZ 48625 is broken. When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (80). The issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that was applied in r957960. The first instance starts successfully, but the second instance fails unexpectedly. The connector does not try to bind to the port and only binds when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "When running the second instance of Tomcat with jsvc, the connector does not attempt to bind to the port and the startup sequence fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connector should attempt to bind to the port when starting the second instance of Tomcat with jsvc, and the startup sequence should not fail in Server.await().", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully.\n2. Start the second instance of Tomcat with jsvc.\n3. Observe that the connector does not attempt to bind to the port and the startup sequence fails in Server.await()."}
