{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I observed this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.\n3. Actual behaviour: The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "I would expect that in StandardServiceinitInternal() the connector.init() call fails, because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() is caught there and, if EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown, then caught in Catalinaload() and then rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.", "SR": "1.
