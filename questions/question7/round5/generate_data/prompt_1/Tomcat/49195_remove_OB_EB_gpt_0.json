Additionally, there could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat, as currently System.exit(0) works regardless of the differentiation. It is possible that jsvc may exhibit the same behavior, but this has not been verified.", "OB": "When installing Tomcat as a service on Windows and starting the service, then stopping the service, an error message is printed.", "EB": "When installing Tomcat as a service on Windows and starting the service, then stopping the service, no error message should be printed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\t1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n\t2. Start the service.\n\t3. Stop the service.\n\t4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as by calling Catalina.stop()."}
