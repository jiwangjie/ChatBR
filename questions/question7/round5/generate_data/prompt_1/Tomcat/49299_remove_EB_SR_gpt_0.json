{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1: Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual behavior does not match the expected behavior.", "OB": "When testing with the attached application (cookiename.war), the page sends a cookie with the following value:\nSet-Cookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. \n\nExpected Behavior: The URL generated by the 'Reload' link on the page should include the custom cookie name as the parameter name instead of 'jsessionid'.\n\n", "EB": "The custom cookie name should be used as the name of the URI parameter when the session ID is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting has been enabled).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' application.\n2. Access the application using a web browser.\n3. Observe the value of the 'Set-Cookie' header in the HTTP response.\n4. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page.\n5. Examine the URL and check if the session ID parameter uses the custom cookie name instead of 'jsessionid'.\n"}
