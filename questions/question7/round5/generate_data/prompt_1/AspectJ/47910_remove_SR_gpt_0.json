{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc with the 'outjar' option to create a jar file, the resulting file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, even though there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside the source directory.", "OB": "I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' option set to '<mydir>', the 'outjar' option set to '<my.jar>', and an output file is created with a .jar extension. However, when I inspect this file, I find that it is not a valid jar file because it is missing the MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "If the 'outjar' option is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file, meaning it should include the MANIFEST.MF file from the source directory.", "SR": "1. Set up a source directory with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.\n2. Use ajc with the 'sourceroots' option set to the directory from step 1, the 'outjar' option set to a desired jar file name, and any other necessary parameters.\n3. Verify that the resulting jar file contains the MANIFEST.MF file from the source directory."}
