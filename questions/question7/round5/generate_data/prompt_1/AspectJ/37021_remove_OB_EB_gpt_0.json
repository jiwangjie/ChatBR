The issue can be reproduced by running the code in the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. Please note that the tests have limitations and may result in false positives due to the lack of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. It was observed that when the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "When declaring warning messages for targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.'", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class.'", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, declare a warning message targeting a .class file. Check the source path listed in the warning message and ensure it is in the form 'app/Main'."}
