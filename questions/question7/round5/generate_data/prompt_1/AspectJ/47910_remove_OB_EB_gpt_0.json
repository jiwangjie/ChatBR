{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When I use the ajc command to compile a source code with the `sourceroots` option and create an output jar file using the `outjar` option, the resulting jar file does not include a `MANIFEST.MF` file. This issue is reproducible regardless of whether there is a `METAINF/MANIFEST.MF` file inside the source code directory or not.", "OB": "When I call `ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>`, an output file is created with a `.jar` extension.", "EB": "The output file created should be a valid jar file that includes a `MANIFEST.MF` file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Use the `ajc` command with the `sourceroots` option to specify the source code directory. 2. Use the `outjar` option to create an output jar file. 3. Verify that the resulting jar file does not include a `MANIFEST.MF` file."}
