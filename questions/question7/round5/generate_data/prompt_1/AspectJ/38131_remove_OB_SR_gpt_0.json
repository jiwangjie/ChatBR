This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. \n\nTo reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n         System.out.println('Hello');\n      }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc -d subpackage Test.java\n\nExpected Result:\nThe compilation should generate the class file in the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nObserved Result:\nA new 'subpackage' directory is created inside the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "OB": "The observed behavior is a new 'subpackage' directory is created inside the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the compilation should generate the class file in the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "SR": "1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d subpackage Test.java"}
