To reproduce the problem, please follow the steps below:\n1. Open the test code located in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.\n2. Run the code to observe the problem.\n\nLimitations of the tests: These tests may produce false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, if the filename does not make sense, it may be omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. I have also encountered cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that specific problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "1. Open the test code located in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.\n2. Run the code to observe the issue with the source path being listed incorrectly in the declare warning messages."}
