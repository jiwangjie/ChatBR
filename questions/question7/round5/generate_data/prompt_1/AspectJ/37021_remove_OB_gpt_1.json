To reproduce the problem, please run the code provided in tests/new/binaryWarnings/. It is important to note that these tests may produce false positives when detecting this error due to the absence of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. AJDT may omit the filename if it does not make sense within its context.", "OB": "The observed behavior is not specified in the bug report.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Compile a Java or AspecJ file into a binary (.class) file.\n2. Trigger a declare warning on the binary file.\n3. Observe that the source path in the warning message is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
