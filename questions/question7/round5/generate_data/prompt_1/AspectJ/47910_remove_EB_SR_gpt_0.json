The documentation for ajc suggests that the outjar parameter should create a zip file, but it does not.", "OB": "When I call ajc with sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, a .jar file is created, but it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "When I call ajc with sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, a valid jar file should be created that includes a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "1. Configure a directory <mydir with some source files.\n2. Run ajc with the parameters sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar.\n3. Check the contents of the generated <my.jar file to verify that it includes a MANIFEST.MF file."}
