{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The current bug is related to the ajc outjar functionality. When using the outjar option, it is expected that the resulting file should be a valid JAR file with a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file inside. However, the current behavior does not include the MANIFEST.MF file in the generated JAR file.", "OB": "When I use the 'ajc' command with the options 'sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar', an output file is created with the .jar extension.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the generated JAR file should contain a valid META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a terminal and navigate to <mydir>.\n2. Run the 'ajc' command with the options 'sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar'.\n3. Check the generated <my.jar> file and verify that it contains the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file."}
