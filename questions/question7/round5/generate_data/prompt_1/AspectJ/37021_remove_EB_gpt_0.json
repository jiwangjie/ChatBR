To reproduce the issue, please follow the steps below:\n1. Navigate to tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory.\n2. Run the provided code to observe the problem.\n\nIt is important to note that these tests have limitations. They may return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it is observed that if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, it simply omits it.", "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There have also been cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that particular problem.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1.
