{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. However, when using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, but I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "When accessing the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed.
