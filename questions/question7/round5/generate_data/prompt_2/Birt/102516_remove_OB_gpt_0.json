The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait. This eventually leads to the message: 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. \n\nBug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will prevent the need to load the entire schema at once.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the data set editor. \n2. Observe the entire schema being queried and the user having to wait. \n3. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed."}
