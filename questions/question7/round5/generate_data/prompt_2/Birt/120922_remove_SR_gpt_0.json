When editing XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that changes need to be saved. However, the error message is not clear and leaves the user uncertain of what action to take. The error message is titled 'Source page is dirty' (including the quotes). Additionally, the user is presented with the options to save or discard changes: 'Yes' to save the changes, 'No' to discard the changes, and 'Cancel' to do nothing and remain on the Source page. This dialog should provide a better title, without quotes. The following alternative behavior is suggested:XML Report Design has been modified.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will receive an error message stating that the 'Source page is dirty' (including the quotes).
