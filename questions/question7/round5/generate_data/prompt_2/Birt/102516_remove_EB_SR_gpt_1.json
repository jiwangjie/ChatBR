{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. The current code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but the warning message still appears on load since the tree is being populated upon load.", "OB": "When opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed.  Despite the inclusion of a schema filter in the code from 6/30/05, a warning message still appears upon loading the page as the tree is being populated with the table and column information.", "EB": "When opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control should initially load only the schema filter and not populate all the tables and columns. The table and column information should be loaded on demand, after applying the schema filter or when expanding each schema individually.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Observe that the tree control shows every schema and all the tables and columns in the data source on load, resulting in a warning message.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Observe that the tree control initially shows only the schema filter.\n3. Apply the desired schema filter.\n4. Expand each schema individually to load and display the tables and columns on demand."}
