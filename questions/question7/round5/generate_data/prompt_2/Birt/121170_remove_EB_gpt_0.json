{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170: getColumnLabel() returns null rather than user recognizable strings from meta data object", "description": "When calling IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction, the labels returned are null. However, after data extraction, the labels returned are recognizable strings.", "OB": "When calling IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction, the labels returned are null.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that IMetaData.getColumnLabel() should return recognizable strings for the column labels, both before and after data extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction.\n2. Note that the labels returned are null.\n3. Extract the data.\n4. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() again after data extraction.\n5. Observe that the labels returned are recognizable strings."}
