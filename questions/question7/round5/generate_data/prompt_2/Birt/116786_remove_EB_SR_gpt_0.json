{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When I view the report design, I noticed that the property 'fileName' is storing an absolute path. It would be more convenient if it saved the relative path instead. Here are the specific details:", "OB": "In the property element <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>", "EB": "The property element <property name='fileName' value='../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/> should store the relative path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the report design. \n2. Check the value of the 'fileName' property in the property element. \n3. Verify that it is storing an absolute path instead of a relative path. \n\nExpected result: \n- The 'fileName' property should store a relative path. For example: <property name='fileName' value='../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>"}
