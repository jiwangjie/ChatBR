{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Despite the schema filter present in the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the tree is still being fully populated on load, resulting in a warning message.", "OB": "When using the code from CVS dated 6/30/05 on the iSeries platform with JTOpenJDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows a warning message on load due to the tree control being fully populated with every schema (catalog) on the system.", "EB": "The load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user either expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
