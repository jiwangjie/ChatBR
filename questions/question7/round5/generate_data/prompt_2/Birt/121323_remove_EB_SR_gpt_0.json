{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not save the filter information correctly. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to the .rptdesign file, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can potentially cause a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' for the column mapping and saving the filter information in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and not stored in the filterInfo HashMap. When leaving the dialog and reopening it, the saved filter information is missing.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should correctly store and persist the filter information, including any XPath expressions with selection parts. When reopening the dialog, the saved filter information should be displayed.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, e.g. 'section[@id='left']', for the column mapping.\n3. Save the filter information.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n6. Verify that the previously entered filter information, including the XPath expression with the selection part, is displayed correctly."}
