{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "The current behavior of the getcolumnlabel method does not return labels that are easily understandable by the user. This is problematic because the labels are displayed to the end user before the extraction process. Therefore, the getcolumnlabel method should return the same labels as after extraction.", "OB": "When using the getcolumnlabel method with a meta data object, it does not return user recognizable strings.", "EB": "The getcolumnlabel method should return user recognizable strings when used with a meta data object.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Obtain a meta data object. 2. Use the getcolumnlabel method on the meta data object. Note that the returned strings are not easily understandable by the user."}
