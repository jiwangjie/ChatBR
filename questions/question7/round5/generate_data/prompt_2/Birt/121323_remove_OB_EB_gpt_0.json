{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. This behavior is inconsistent and may lead to issues.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part in the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information contained in the filterInfo HashMap when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left'].\n3. Leave the dialog.\n\nExpected result: The filter information should be persisted and not lost."}
