{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient sorting logic required for disk sorting with border value for row", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk with 40000 rows, and limiting the program to process less than 40000 rows, the observed behavior is as follows: 1. The file is saved as a temporary file. 2. The file is loaded into memory. 3. Sorting is performed on the data. 4. The sorted data is saved to a temporary file.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Configure the program to process less than 40000 rows. 3. Observe the following operations: a) Save the file as a temporary file. b) Load the file into memory. c) Perform sorting on the data. d) Save the sorted data to a temporary file."}
