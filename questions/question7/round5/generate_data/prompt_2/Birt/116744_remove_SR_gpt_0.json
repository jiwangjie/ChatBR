However, the expected behavior is different for each content type.\n\nExpected results:\n\n- For Plain, I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed.\n- For Auto, I expect content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags.\n- For HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 to appear literally with RTF tags.\n\nThe attached report demonstrates the issue.", "OB": "When setting the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML, the report displays the same results, regardless of the chosen content type.", "EB": "- When setting the Content Type to Plain, the literal content (tags and all) should be displayed.\n- When setting the Content Type to Auto, the report should display content 1, 2, and 3 properly without any HTML or RTF tags.\n- When setting the Content Type to HTML, content 1 and 2 should appear properly without any HTML tags, and content 3 should appear literally with RTF tags.\n\nOverall, the report should reflect the different content types correctly according to the expected behavior.", "SR": "1.
