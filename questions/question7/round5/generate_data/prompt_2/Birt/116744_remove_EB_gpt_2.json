It does not render HTML text within <html> tags properly, HTML fragments not within <html> tags are not displayed correctly, and text with RTF tags is also not rendered correctly.", "EB": "The dynamic text element should accurately display all types of content in the db field. It should properly render HTML text within <html> tags, display HTML fragments correctly even if they are not within <html> tags, and correctly render text with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a db field with three types of content: \n   - HTML text within <html> tags\n   - HTML fragments not within <html> tags\n   - Text with RTF tags\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field.\n3. Observe that the dynamic text element is not displaying the content accurately for each of the three types of content."}
