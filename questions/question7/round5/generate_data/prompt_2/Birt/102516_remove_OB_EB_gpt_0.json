Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, resulting in a long wait time. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed. Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> requests the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and a long wait time is experienced. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, only a portion of the schema should be queried and displayed initially. The tables and columns should load on demand as the user navigates through the tree control.", "SR": "1. Open the data set editor for a SQL Query.\n2.
