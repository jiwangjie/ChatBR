{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. The current code from CVS as of 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, there is a delay while the entire schema is queried, and eventually the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The data set editor should load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema at once.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: <br>1. Open the data set editor. <br>2. Observe the delay and the warning message. <br>3. Note that the entire schema is queried instead of loading tables and columns on demand. <br>4. Refer to Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a>, which asks for the ability to filter based on schema."}
