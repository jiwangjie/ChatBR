{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Currently, with the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, although there is a schema filter, a warning message is still shown on load because the tree is being populated. ", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page displays every schema on the system, resulting in a large number of tables being loaded on each page load. This causes a warning message to be displayed. ", "EB": "The tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should only load tables and columns when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This would eliminate the warning message that is currently shown on page load. ", "SR": ""}
