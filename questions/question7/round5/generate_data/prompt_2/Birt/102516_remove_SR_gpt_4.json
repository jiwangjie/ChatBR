{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query contains a tree control that displays the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Despite the presence of a schema filter in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, there is still a warning message displayed during the page load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "When using the JTOpenJDBC drivers on the iSeries platform, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor displays every schema, resulting in a large number of tables being shown. Despite the schema filter, a warning message is displayed during page load.", "EB": "The loading of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
