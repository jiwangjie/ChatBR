{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get_column_label from metadata object returns null labels before extraction", "description": "When calling the get_column_label method on a metadata object before extraction, the labels returned are null. After extraction, the labels returned are user recognizable strings.", "OB": "The labels returned before extraction are null, while the ones after extraction are recognizable strings.", "EB": "The get_column_label method should return user recognizable strings for the labels before extraction as well.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a metadata object. 2. Call the get_column_label method on the metadata object before extraction. 3. Observe that the labels returned are null. 4. Perform the extraction. 5. Call the get_column_label method again on the metadata object after extraction. 6. Observe that the labels returned are now user recognizable strings."}
