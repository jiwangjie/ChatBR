{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return recognizable strings", "description": "The current behavior is that the labels returned before extraction are null, while the ones after extraction are recognizable strings. However, since the labels need to be displayed to the end user before doing the extraction, the `getcolumnlabel` function before extraction should also return the same recognizable labels as after extraction.", "OB": "Currently, the labels returned by the `getcolumnlabel` function before extraction are null.", "EB": "After the bug is fixed, the `getcolumnlabel` function before extraction should return the same recognizable labels as after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Call the `getcolumnlabel` function on a meta data object before extraction. \n2. Check the returned label value, it should be null. \n3. Perform an extraction on the same meta data object. \n4. Call the `getcolumnlabel` function on the extracted meta data object. \n5. Check the returned label value, it should be a recognizable string."}
