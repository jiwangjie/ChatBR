{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic needed for disk sorting when there is a border value for row value", "description": "When dealing with disk sorting, the current logic is not efficient enough, especially when there is a border value for the row value. The current approach involves copying the file to the destination folder. However, a more efficient logic should be implemented to directly sort the data in memory and then write it to the file.", "OB": "N/A", "EB": "The current logic for disk sorting is not efficient when there is a border value for the row value.

Generate a dataset that contains a border value for the row value.\n2. Apply the current disk sorting logic.\n3. Observe the performance and check if the sorting is accurate.\n4. Implement a new logic to directly sort the data in memory and write it to the file.\n5. Repeat step 2 and observe the performance and accuracy of the sorting.\n6. Compare the performance and accuracy of the current and new logic."}
