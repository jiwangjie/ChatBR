(including the quotes).\n- The user is prompted with the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' to save, discard, or do nothing with the changes, respectively.\n\nThe observed problem is that it is unclear to the user how to save or discard the changes and the error message is not very informative.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The dialog box should have a more informative title, without the quotes.\n- The error message should provide clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes.\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Switch to the 'source' view.\n3. Make some changes to the XML.\n4. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n\nThe 'Dirty Page' behavior and error message should be improved to provide clear instructions to the user on how to save or discard changes.", "OB": "When attempting to switch from the 'source' view to the Layout view after making changes to the XML, an error dialog box with the title 'Error' (including the quotes) is displayed.
