The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, the tree is loaded immediately when the page is opened, regardless of whether or not the user intends to interact with it. This can cause performance issues and slow down the overall user experience. It would be more efficient if the tree could be loaded on demand, i.e., when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "Currently, when opening the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query, the tree control listing the tables and columns is immediately loaded, even if it is not being used.", "EB": "The tree control listing the tables and columns should only be loaded when it is needed, i.e., when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the tree control listing the tables and columns is immediately loaded.\n3. Try expanding the tree or applying a filter and observe the performance and responsiveness of the page."}
