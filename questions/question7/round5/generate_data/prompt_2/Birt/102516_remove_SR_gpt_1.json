{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor loads all tables and columns on page load instead of on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which is easily several hundred tables. Even with the schema filter implemented in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, there is still a warning message upon page load because the tree is being populated at that time.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in hundreds of tables being loaded on page load.
