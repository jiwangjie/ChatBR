Currently, when the user makes changes to the XML Report Design, a dialog box pops up with the message 'Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved.' (including the quotes). The user then needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes). A better and more typical approach would be for the dialog to say 'XML Report Design has been changed.' The dialog should not have quotes in the title.", "OB": "The 'Dirty Page' behavior in the XML Report Designer editor is not user-friendly. When making changes to the XML Report Design, a dialog with the message 'Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved.' appears, along with a title 'Error'.", "EB": "The 'Dirty Page' behavior in the XML Report Designer editor should be improved.
