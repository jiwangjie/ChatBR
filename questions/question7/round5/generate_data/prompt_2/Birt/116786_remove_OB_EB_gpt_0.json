{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path correctly. Currently, when including a library from a different folder, the absolute path is being saved instead of the relative path.", "OB": "The BIRT designer is saving the absolute path of the library instead of the relative path.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should save the relative path of the library when including it in a report design.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open a report design in the BIRT designer. \n2. Include a library from a different folder using the 'Include Library' option. \n3. Save the report design. \n4. Check the saved path of the included library to see if it is the absolute path or the relative path."}
