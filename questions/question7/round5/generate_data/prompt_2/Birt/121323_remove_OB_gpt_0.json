{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not save the filter information when leaving the dialog, resulting in the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap to be lost. The suggested solution is to allow the use of plain XPath expressions for column mapping and store the filter information separately for those who need it.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not save the filter information when leaving the dialog.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should save the filter information when leaving the dialog, ensuring that it is persisted in the .rptdesign file. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'].\n3. Note that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Check the .rptdesign file to see that the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
