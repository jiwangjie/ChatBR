{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer currently stores the absolute path. This should be changed to store the relative path instead.", "OB": "Currently, I can see that the report design stores the absolute path of the library as <propertyname='fileName'/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The report design should store the relative path of the library instead of the absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Create a report design in the folder $project/test.\n2. Include a library from the folder $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary in the report design.\n3. Check the properties of the included library and verify that it is storing the relative path correctly."}
