{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The data entered in the filterInfo HashMap should persist when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' for the column mapping.\n3. Click 'OK' or 'Apply' to leave the dialog.\n4. Check if the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is still present and persisted in the .rptdesign file."}
