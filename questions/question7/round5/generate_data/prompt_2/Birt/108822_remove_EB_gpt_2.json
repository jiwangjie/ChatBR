The program saves the file as a temporary file.\n2. The program loads the file into memory.\n3. Sorting is performed on the data in memory.\n4. The sorted data is saved back to the temporary file.\n", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk.\n2. Set the program to process only the data less than 40000.\n3. Observe the following operations being performed:\n   a. The program saves the file as a temporary file.\n   b. The program loads the file into memory.\n   c. Sorting is performed on the data in memory.\n   d. The sorted data is saved back to the temporary file.\n"}
