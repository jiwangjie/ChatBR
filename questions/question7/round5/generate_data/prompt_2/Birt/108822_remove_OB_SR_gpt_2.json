Instead of sorting the data in memory and then writing it to the file, the sorting process is inefficient and not accurate.", "EB": "A more efficient logic should be implemented for disk sorting when there is a border value for row value. The data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Copy the file to the destination folder.\n2. Observe the incorrect sorting of the data.\nExpected result: The data should be sorted correctly in the file."}
