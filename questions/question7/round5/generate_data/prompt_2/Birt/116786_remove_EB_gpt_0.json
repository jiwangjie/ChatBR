{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When I open the report design, I can see that the file path for the included library is stored as an absolute path. For example, <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'></property>.", "EB": "", "SR": "To resolve this issue, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path for the included library. For example, if my report design is located at $project/test and I include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the BIRT designer should save the relative path instead of the absolute path."}
