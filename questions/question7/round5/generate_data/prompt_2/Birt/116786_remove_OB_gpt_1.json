{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. Currently, when including a library in a report design, the absolute path is being used instead of the relative path. This causes issues when the report design is moved or shared with others. The expected behavior is for the BIRT designer to automatically generate and save the relative path when including a library.\n\nExample:\n$project/test contains my report design. Now include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "OB": "Currently, when a library is included in a report design, the absolute path such as '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' is being stored instead of the relative path.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. For example, if the report design is located at '$project/test' and a library is included from '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary', the BIRT designer should store the relative path '../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' instead of the absolute path.", "SR": "1.
