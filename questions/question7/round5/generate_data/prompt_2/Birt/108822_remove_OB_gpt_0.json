A better logic should be implemented where the data is sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort the data on disk using the program\n2. Make sure the program processes less than 40000 rows of data\n3. Observe the following operations: \n   a. The file is saved as a temp file\n   b. The file is loaded into memory\n   c. The data is sorted\n   d. The sorted file is saved as a temp file"}
