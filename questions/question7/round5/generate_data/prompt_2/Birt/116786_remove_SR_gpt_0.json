{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer is currently storing the absolute path instead of the relative path. This bug report aims to address this issue and ensure that the BIRT designer generates and saves the correct relative path for library inclusion.", "OB": "Currently, I observed that the report design is storing the absolute path for library inclusion. For example, in the <property name=\"fileName\"> property, the absolute path is being used: E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>. This is causing issues as the path should be relative.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test, the relative path should be used: $project/test/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Check the <property name=\"fileName\"> property of the library include and ensure it contains the correct relative path."}
