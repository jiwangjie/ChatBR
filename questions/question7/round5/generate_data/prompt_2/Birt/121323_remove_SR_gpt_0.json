{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression includes a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog should be persisted along with the RelationInformation when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping that includes a selection part, such as section[@id='left']. 3. Add any additional information as necessary. 4. Leave the dialog and observe that the filter information entered is lost."}
