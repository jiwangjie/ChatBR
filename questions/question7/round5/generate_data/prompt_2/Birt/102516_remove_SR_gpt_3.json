The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Despite the presence of a schema filter in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, I still encounter a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in a large number of tables being shown.
