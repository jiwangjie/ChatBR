{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient disk sorting logic needed for handling border values in row values", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for processing disk sorting when there is a border value for row value is not efficient.", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to be implemented for processing disk sorting when there is a border value for row value. Instead of saving the file as a temp file and then calling it to memory for sorting, the data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort 40,000 rows of data on disk. \n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40,000. \n3. Observe the following operations: \n  a. Save the file as a temp file. \n  b. Call the file to memory. \n  c. Sort the data. \n  d. Save the file to temp file."}
