", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor displays incorrectly in the property sheet. It does not adjust its width to match the column width in the property sheet.", "EB": "I would expect the ComboBoxCellEditor to always match the width of the property sheet column. Currently, it is not resizing correctly. Note that the DialogCellEditor with a visible button behaves correctly. It needs further investigation to determine if this issue is within our code or related to the SWT framework.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Edit a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly to match the column width in the property sheet."}
