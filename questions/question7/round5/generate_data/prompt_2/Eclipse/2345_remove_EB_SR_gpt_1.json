Create a new basic project\n2. Create a new file named test.xml\n3. The editor used is the scripted resource editor example, which does not consider the XML file content\n4. In the Navigator, select test.xml\n5. Choose 'Open With...' and select 'Default Text Editor'\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter selecting 'Default Text Editor', nothing happens. The scripted resource editor is still active and the file test.xml is not opened in the text editor.\n\nNOTES: Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types. It should open a new editor on the file because the editor type is different.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
