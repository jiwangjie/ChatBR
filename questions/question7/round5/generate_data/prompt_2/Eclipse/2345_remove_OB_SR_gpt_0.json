{"id": "2345", "title": "Bug 2345 - Opening a file with a different editor has no effect if the file is already open", "description": "When attempting to open a file with a different type of editor, the file remains unchanged if it is already open in the editor. This bug was observed in version 1GEWMSQ.", "OB": "I attempted to open a file (test.xml) with a different editor (Default Text Editor) via the 'Open With...' option in the Navigator. However, nothing happened and the file remained in the existing editor (scripted resource editor example).", "EB": "Reproduce the bug by following these steps:\n1. Open the editor (scripted resource editor example) in a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml'.\n3. Open the file 'test.xml' in the Navigator.\n4. Right-click on 'test.xml' and choose 'Open With...' > 'Default Text Editor'.\n5. Expectation: The file 'test.xml' should open in a new editor (Default Text Editor), disregarding its content or the type of the current editor.\n\nNOTE: This bug should be fixed to ensure that searching for an existing open file also considers the editor type. When attempting to open a file with a different editor, it should always open a new editor regardless of its current editor type.", "SR": "1.
