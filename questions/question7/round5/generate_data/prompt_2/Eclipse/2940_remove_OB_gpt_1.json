{"id": "2940", "title": "Bug 2940: Export Zip - Updating of checkboxes does not show busy cursor", "description": "When updating the checkboxes in the Export Zip feature, the busy cursor should be displayed. Currently, it takes a long time (approximately 30 seconds in my case) to update the checked state of the table, but there is no indication that the system is busy. The expected behavior is for a busy cursor to be shown during this process.", "OB": "When updating the checkboxes in the Export Zip feature, no busy cursor is displayed.", "EB": "During the update of checkboxes in the Export Zip feature, a busy cursor should be shown to indicate that the system is busy.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1.
