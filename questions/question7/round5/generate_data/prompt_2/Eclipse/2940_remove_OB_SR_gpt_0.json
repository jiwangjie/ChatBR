A busy cursor should be shown during the update process.", "OB": "Currently, there is no indication that the update is happening, and it takes a long time for the checked state of the table to be updated.", "EB": "A busy cursor should be shown during the update process, providing a visual indication and feedback to the user.

Check some checkboxes in the table and observe the lack of a busy cursor. 3. Wait for the table to update and notice that it takes a long time. 4. Add a busy cursor to the update process and verify that it is shown during the update."}
