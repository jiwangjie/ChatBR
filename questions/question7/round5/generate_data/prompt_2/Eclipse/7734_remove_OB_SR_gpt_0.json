{"id": "7734", "title": "System can be shut down without save file warnings", "description": "When shutting down the system, the application does not prompt the user to save their files before proceeding with the shutdown. This can result in unsaved work being lost.", "OB": "Currently, when attempting to shut down the system, there is no notification or prompt to save the user's files.", "EB": "The application should display a dialog box asking the user if they want to save their file before proceeding with the shutdown. The dialog box should provide options for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' (which will halt the shutdown).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open any file in the application. 2. Try to shut down the system without saving the file. 3. Observe that there is no prompt to save the file before the shutdown. The system shuts down without any warning."}
