", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer, the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. If any of the strings in the drop-down list are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The issue is that the drop-down button may now be too far to the right and off the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped.\n\nFrom a user's perspective, they can no longer see the drop-down button unless they make the property sheet view wider.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size correctly in the property sheet, taking into account the width of the drop-down list and ensuring that the drop-down button remains visible within the property sheet.", "SR": "How to reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object that uses ComboBoxCellEditor for a property.\n3. Ensure that the strings in the drop-down list are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box grows to accommodate the width of the widest item.\n5. Verify that the drop-down button is no longer visible within the property sheet due to being clipped.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe ComboBoxCellEditor should size correctly in the property sheet, ensuring that the drop-down button remains visible even when the width of the drop-down list exceeds the width of the property sheet column."}
