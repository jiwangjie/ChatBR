However, this is not always what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preferences) to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should be: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse.\n2. Create a new file.\n3.
