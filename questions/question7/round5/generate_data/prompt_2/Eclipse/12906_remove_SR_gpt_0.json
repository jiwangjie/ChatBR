However, currently, no warning message is displayed.", "OB": "1. Close all open files.\n2. Go to the Java Perspective.\n3. Double-click on a Java file to open it in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the same Java file.\n5. Select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n6. Observe that nothing happens.\n\nThe workbench should display a warning message indicating that there may be unsaved changes and asking if the user wants to proceed.\n\nWe believe it is a safety feature implemented in WSAD to prevent external editing while a file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "However, when attempting to open a file in a different editor while it is already opened in one editor, a warning message should be displayed indicating that there may be unsaved changes and asking if the user wants to proceed.", "SR": "1.
