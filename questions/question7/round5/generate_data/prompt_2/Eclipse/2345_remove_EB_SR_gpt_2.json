Open a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named test.xml.\n3. By default, the scripted resource editor example is used to open the XML files.\n4. Select test.xml in the Navigator.\n5. Choose 'Open With...' and select 'Default Text Editor'.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nNothing happens and the scripted resource editor example remains active, ignoring the XML file content.\n\nSearching for an existing open file should also consider the editor types.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nInstead of reactivating the scripted resource editor example, a new editor should be opened for the file because the editor type is different.\n\nNOTES:", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
