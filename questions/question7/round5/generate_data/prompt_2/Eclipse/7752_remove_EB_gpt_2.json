{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752: Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g. 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' -> 'Export' and then select 'Zip File' to export\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (e.g. 'test.zip') and begin the export to a zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up indicating that problems were encountered during export, and the details in the message list the file with the same name in 'Project2' as the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe export process should complete successfully without any error messages, and the zip file should contain all the files from both projects with the same file name under different directories.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g. 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' -> 'Export' and then select 'Zip File' to export\n4.
