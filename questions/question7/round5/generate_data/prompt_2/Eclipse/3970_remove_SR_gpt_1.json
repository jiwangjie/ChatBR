The Windows workstations are being used as X terminals and to run Eclipse, as they are cheaper than Unix boxes.", "OB": "When creating a new file, the line delimiter used is based on the value returned by System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is meant for Unix. A UI (Preferences) should be provided by the Workbench to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values should include: DOS/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins.", "SR": ""}
