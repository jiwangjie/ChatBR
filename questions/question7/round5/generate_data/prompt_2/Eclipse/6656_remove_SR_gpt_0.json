{"id": "6656", "title": "Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "When resizing the view on Linux OS (build 20011127), the tool items such as the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) move below the label. This behavior is not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000. This could potentially confuse users as they are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner. This should be considered as a usability problem.", "OB": "On Linux, when resizing the view, the pulldown menu icon and the close icon move below the label.", "EB": "The pulldown menu icon and the close icon should stay on the same line as the label no matter how small the view gets.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n3. Observe the position of the pulldown menu icon and the close icon in relation to the label."}
