Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g. 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select File > Export and choose 'Zip File' to export\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier, provide a name for the zip file (e.g. 'test.zip'), and start the export to zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box appears, stating that problems were encountered during the export. The details of the error message specify the file with the same name in 'project2' as the issue.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nBoth files with the same name should be successfully exported to the zip file, preserving their directory structure.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nPlease follow the steps mentioned in the 'Steps to reproduce' section above."}
