{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows editing of objects using name-value pairs in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the create cell editor method of IPropertyDescriptor to create editors with ComboBoxCellEditor. The constructor of ComboBoxCellEditor can be given an array of strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet and the drop down button appears at the right edge of the column. The problem occurs when any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. The combo box grows to the width of the largest item, causing the drop down button to be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in it being clipped. Users cannot see the combo drop down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The combo box grows to the width of the largest item when any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. As a result, the drop down button is positioned too far right and is clipped off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always have the same width as the property sheet column. This would ensure that the drop down button is always visible. The behavior should be similar to the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object with ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n3. Make one of the strings wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box grows to the width of the largest item.\n5. Notice that the drop down button is positioned too far right and is clipped off the visible area of the property sheet.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe combo box should always have the same width as the property sheet column. This would ensure that the drop down button is always visible."}
