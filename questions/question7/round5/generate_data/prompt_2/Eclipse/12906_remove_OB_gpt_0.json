{"id": "12906", "title": "Bug 12906 - Cannot open a file in another editor if it is already opened in one editor (should display a warning message)", "description": "When a file is already opened in one editor, it should not be possible to open the same file in another editor. Currently, there is no warning message displayed when attempting to do so.", "OB": "Currently, it is possible to open a file in multiple editors simultaneously.", "EB": "However, when attempting to open a file that is already opened in one editor, a warning message should be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' and then 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will open with the Java file.\n3. Close the Notepad or WordPad window.\n4. In the Java Perspective, double click on the same Java file to open it again in the workbench.\n5. Right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' and then 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nA warning message should be displayed in the workbench indicating that opening the file in another editor may overwrite changes. The message should prompt the user to confirm if they want to continue or show an error message that the file cannot be opened in another editor until all instances are closed.\n\nWe believe this is a safety feature where the IDE doesn't allow external editing of files that are already opened in the IDE."}
