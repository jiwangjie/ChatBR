Create a new basic project. \n2. Create a new file named test.xml. \n3. The editor used is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content. \n4. In the Navigator, select test.xml. \n5. Choose 'Open With...' / 'Default Text Editor'. \n6. Nothing happens; the scripted resource editor example is reactivated. \n\nSearching for an existing open file should also consider the editor types. It should open a new editor on the file because the editor type is different.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
