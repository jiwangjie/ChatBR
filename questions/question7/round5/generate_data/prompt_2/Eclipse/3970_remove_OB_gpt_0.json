{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970: UI needed to define default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Bug 3970: The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse, since they are cheaper than Unix boxes. Currently, when a new file is created on Windows, it does not have Unix line delimiters. It should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. Therefore, there should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for line delimiters should include: DOS/Windows, Mac, and Unix default platform line delimiters. This UI should be provided by the Workbench so that all plugins can use the same line delimiter for new files.", "OB": "Currently, when a new file is created on Windows, it does not have Unix line delimiters.", "EB": "When a new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow this scenario: 1. Use Unix and Windows workstations to develop a Unix product/program."}
