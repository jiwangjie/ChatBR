{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows editing of objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs displayed in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the IPropertyDescriptor method to create a cell editor, specifically the ComboBoxCellEditor constructor which can be given a list of strings. The editor is displayed in column two of the property sheet, with the drop-down button appearing at the right edge of the column.\n\nHowever, if any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box expands to the width of the widest item. The problem is that the drop-down button may now be too far to the right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in it being clipped. As a result, users are unable to see the drop-down button without expanding the property sheet view until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "When a ComboBoxCellEditor is used in column two of the property sheet and any of the strings in the drop-down list is wider than the column, the combo box expands to the width of the widest item. As a result, the drop-down button may move outside the visible area of the property sheet and becomes clipped.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should size correctly, so that the drop-down button always remains within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the strings in the drop-down list. ", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the property sheet viewer.\n2. Edit an object using a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n3. Ensure that at least one string in the ComboBoxCellEditor drop-down list is wider than the column width.\n4. Observe that the combo box expands to the width of the widest string, causing the drop-down button to move outside the visible area of the property sheet and becoming clipped."}
