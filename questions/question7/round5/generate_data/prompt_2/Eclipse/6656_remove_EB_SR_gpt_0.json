{"id": "6656", "title": "Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "On Linux, when running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000), if a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label. This behavior may confuse users.", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down.", "EB": "The pulldown menu icon and the close icon should not move down when the view is resized smaller. They should remain in their original position above the label.", "SR": "1. Launch the application.\n2. Open a view like the Navigator.\n3. Resize the view smaller.\n4. Observe the position of the pulldown menu icon and the close icon.\n\nExpected result: The pulldown menu icon and the close icon should remain in their original position above the label even when the view is resized smaller.\n\nActual result: The pulldown menu icon and the close icon move down when the view is resized smaller."}
