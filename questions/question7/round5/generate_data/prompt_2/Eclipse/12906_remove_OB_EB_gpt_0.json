Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, stating that all files need to be closed first before opening the file in another editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective, open a different java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n5. Observe that nothing happens and no warning message is displayed. Expected behavior is that a warning message or error message should be displayed as described in the 'EB' section."}
