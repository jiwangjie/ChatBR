{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "The close button and the label are not staying on the same line when the view is resized smaller. This can cause a usability problem as users expect the close button to be on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "OB": "When the view is resized smaller, the close button moves down and is no longer on the same line as the label.", "EB": "The close button and the label should remain on the same line even when the view is resized smaller.", "SR": "1. Open the view. 2. Resize the view to make it smaller. 3. Observe that the close button moves down and is not on the same line as the label."}
