{"id": "7752", "title": "Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select File > Export and choose 'Zip File' to export\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (e.g., 'test.zip'), and begin exporting to a zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up indicating that there were problems encountered during the export process. The error details list the file with the same name in 'project2' as the cause of the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe export process should complete successfully without any errors. All the files with the same names under different directories should be included in the zip file.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nPlease refer to the 'Steps to reproduce' section."}
