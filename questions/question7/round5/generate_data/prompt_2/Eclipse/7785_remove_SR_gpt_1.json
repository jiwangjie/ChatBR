A dialog will come up. \n4) Browse for a valid container location. \n5) Type the filename, but ignore the extension, which isn't requested. \n6) Click Ok. \n\nObserved Behavior: The Navigator has added the file in the specified location, but no file extension is shown.\n\n", "EB": "The file is saved as a generic file, as opening it will show that the file is opened as plain text.\n\nExpected Behavior: The file should be saved with the same extension as the original, unless explicitly changed.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1) Open an existing java file.\n2) Make some changes to the file.\n3) Click on the 'Save As' icon located next to the Save icon.\n4) In the dialog that appears, browse for a valid location to save the file.\n5) Type the desired filename, but do not include the file extension.\n6) Click the 'OK' button.\n\nExpected Result: The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file, unless a different extension is explicitly specified in the file name during the 'Save As' process."}
