However, this does not always align with the user's preference.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. A UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values for line delimiters should be: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins to ensure uniformity in line delimiters for new files.", "SR": ""}
