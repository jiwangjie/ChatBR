In my opinion, the refiltering should only happen when closing the working set selection dialog, not during the manipulation. Additionally, I believe that pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to working sets, including the removal of the working set.", "OB": "The package view is immediately refiltered when a working set is deleted.", "EB": "The package view should only be refiltered when the working set selection dialog is closed, not during the manipulation.

Observe that the package view is filtered.\n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set. Delete the first working set."}
