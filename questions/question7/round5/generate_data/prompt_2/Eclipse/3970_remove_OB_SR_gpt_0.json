Instead, it uses the line delimiters specific to Windows. This is problematic because the end product is a Unix product.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters instead of the Windows line delimiters. There should be a UI (Preference) within Eclipse to define the line delimiters for new files. The possible values for line delimiters should include: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be available within the Workbench to ensure consistency across all plugins in terms of line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows machine.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter of the new file to confirm it is using Windows line delimiters instead of Unix line delimiters."}
