", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. The width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column. It is not working the same as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box in the ComboBoxCellEditor to always be the width of the property sheet column, just like the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. This needs to be investigated further to determine if the issue is with our application or with SWT.", "SR": "1. Open the property sheet in the application.\n2. Enable editing a property that uses a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Compare this behavior to the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible and the width of the combo box matches the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Investigate if the issue lies with our application or with SWT."}
