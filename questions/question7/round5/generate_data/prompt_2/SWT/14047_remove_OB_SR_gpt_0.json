{"id": "14047", "title": "StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap", "description": "When changing the text in a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled, the widget is redrawing more times than necessary. This causes inefficiency and slows down the performance of the application.", "OB": "Currently, when changing the text in a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled, the widget is redrawing multiple times for each visible line, resulting in a significant number of unnecessary redraw operations.", "EB": "This issue should be addressed by limiting the redraw operations to a maximum of one per visible line when changing the text in a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled. This will improve the performance and efficiency of the application.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled.\n2. Add a long text that exceeds the widget's width.\n3. Change the content of the StyledText widget.\n4. Observe the number of redraw operations that occur during the text change process."}
