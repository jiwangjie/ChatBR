{"id": "12398", "title": "Bug 12398: Accessibility problems", "description": "When launching the Help view, I need to first click on one of the interactive areas (such as the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame) before it starts working properly. This is an issue because the Help view should be accessible via keyboard navigation without requiring an initial click.", "OB": "When I launch the Help view, the tab key does not have any effect.", "EB": "The Help view should start in a way that can be immediately navigated using the keyboard.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Help view on a Windows 2000 machine (on March 26, 2002).\n2. Attempt to navigate using the tab key and observe that it does not have any effect."}
