Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page display automatic borders, making them appear as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these text fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Select a Project. \n2. Right click and select 'Properties'. \n3. On the subsequent Info page, observe that the readonly fields (such as Path, Type, etc.) are displayed as text fields."}
