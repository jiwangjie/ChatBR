{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is slower than close and reopen in Java editor", "description": "When comparing the performance of the 'Revert' option with that of 'Close and Reopen' in the Java editor, it is observed that 'Revert' takes more time.", "OB": "The time taken to perform 'Revert' is significantly longer than the time taken to perform 'Close and Reopen'.", "EB": "This behavior is unexpected because the action of reverting should not take more time than simply closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1. Open the Java editor for the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' located in the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' within the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2. Mark the file as dirty by adding a space character at the end of the first line.\n3. On a fast machine, it takes approximately 8 seconds to perform the following steps:\n   a. Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n   b. Choose 'No' in the dialog prompt asking to save changes.\n   c. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n4. However, when repeating steps 1 and 2, and instead selecting the 'Revert' option from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original."}
