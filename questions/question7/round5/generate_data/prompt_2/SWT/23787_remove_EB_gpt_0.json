Integration build 09/17. The text fields used in the Project Properties Info page look fine on Windows, but on motif platforms (Solaris/AIX/HPUX), these text fields have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms (Solaris/AIX/HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out much worse.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: Select a Project, right-click and select Properties. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (such as Path, Type, etc.) and notice the presence of automatic borders and different colored backgrounds on motif platforms (Solaris/AIX/HPUX) that make them stand out as user input targets."}
