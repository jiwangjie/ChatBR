The issue is observed in the integration build 09/17. The text fields in the Project Properties Info page appear differently on motif platforms compared to Windows. On motif platforms, these text fields get automatic borders, which make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds that make them stand out even more. This is not desirable as it looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets.

This change would help ensure that their values can be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": ""}
