Integration build 09/17. The text fields in the Info page of the Project Properties dialog look bad on all motif platforms. On motif platforms, these text fields have automatic borders, which make it look like they are user input targets. In addition, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds that make them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Info page of the Project Properties dialog have automatic borders that make them look like user input targets.
