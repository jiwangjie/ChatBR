Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, making the constructor private will prevent people from instantiating the class when it is not needed. This will not add any size because the compiler automatically adds a public constructor.", "SR": "To implement the suggested change, replace the line 'static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);' with 'static Callback callback = new Callback(BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);'. This change should have the same effect on functionality."}
