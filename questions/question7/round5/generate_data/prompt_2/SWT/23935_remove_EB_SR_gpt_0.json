{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree should not get focus. On Linux, the text widget should lose focus when you click on the tree. The text widget should not be a child of the tree. This should not cause platform UI bug 2470.", "SR": "1. Open the application on a Linux system.\n2. Navigate to the page where the Tree widget and Text widget are present.\n3. Click anywhere in the Tree widget.\n4. Verify that the Tree widget gains focus.\n5. Verify that the Text widget does not lose focus.\n6. Verify that the Text widget is a child of the Tree widget.\n7. Confirm that the platform UI bug 2470 is present."}
