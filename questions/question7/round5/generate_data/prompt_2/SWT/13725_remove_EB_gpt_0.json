{"id": "13725", "title": "Bug 13725 - Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "description": "I have observed that the 'Revert' functionality in the java editor is significantly slower than the 'Close and Reopen' approach. When I select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes about 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original. However, if I close the editor and reopen it, it only takes about 8 seconds. This behavior seems problematic and needs investigation.", "OB": "When I perform the following steps:\n1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and insert a space character to mark the file as dirty.\nThen, on my fast machine, it takes about 8 seconds to:\n- Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n- Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n- Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.", "EB": "I expect the 'Revert' functionality to be as fast as the 'Close and Reopen' approach, taking around 8 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "SR": "1) Open the editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and insert a space character.\n3) Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n4) When prompted, choose 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n5) Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n6) Observe the time it takes for the contents of the window to be replaced with the original.\n7) Repeat steps 1) and 2).\n8) Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n9) Observe the time it takes for the contents of the window to be replaced with the original."}
