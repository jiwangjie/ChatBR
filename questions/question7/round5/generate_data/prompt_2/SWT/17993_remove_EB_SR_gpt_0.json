{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the feature searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds a matching entry, it replaces what was typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, causing the case of the typed entry to be changed to match the value in the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. It would be better if what is typed is not automatically replaced with a value from the history, and a full 'autocomplete' feature could be considered in the future.", "OB": "In the Find/Replace dialog accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace..., when typing in either the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history if a matching entry is found. The case of the typed entry may also be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "When typing in the Find/Replace dialog, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history. The case of the typed entry should remain unchanged.", "SR": "1. Launch the F1 build of the application.\n2. Go to Edit -> Find/Replace...\n3. Type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.\n4. Observe if the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history and if the case of the entry is changed to match the value in the history."}
