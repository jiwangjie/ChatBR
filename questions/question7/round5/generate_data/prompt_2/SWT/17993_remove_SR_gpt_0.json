{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build has a behavior where what is typed in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields gets replaced with a value from the history of recent searches. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. The behavior also changes the case of what is typed to match the case of the value in the history. It would be better if the Find/Replace feature allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed without modifying the case of what the user types.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...), if a previous search entry is found in the history when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the value from the history is automatically replacing what is being typed. The search of the history is case insensitive, so the case of what is typed may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. It should allow the user to perform find and replace operations without modifying the case of what is typed. The feature could be enhanced in the future to include a full 'autocomplete' feature. Until then, the behavior of replacing the typed entry should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document. 2. Go to Edit -> Find/Replace... and open the Find/Replace dialog. 3. Start typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields. Observe that if a previous search entry is found in the history, it automatically gets replaced, and the case of what is typed may change to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior prevents performing find and replace operations effectively."}
