{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search.", "EB": "The behavior should be changed to something more simple which allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a document so that 'Edit' > 'Find/Replace...' becomes available.\n2. Choose 'Edit' > 'Find/Replace...'\n3. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n4. Click 'Find'.\n5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."}
