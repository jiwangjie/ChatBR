{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the feature searches for entries from a previous search. If a matching entry is found in the history, what has been typed is replaced with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, resulting in the case of what has been typed being changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior can prevent find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the feature searches for entries from a previous search and replaces what has been typed with the value from the history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the feature should not replace what has been typed with the value from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the application and go to the Edit menu. \n2. Choose 'Find/Replace...'. \n3. In the 'Find' field, type 'a'. \n4. Click on 'Find'. \n5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field, but observe that it is automatically replaced with the value from the history."}
