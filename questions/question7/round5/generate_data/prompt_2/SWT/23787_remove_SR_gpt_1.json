Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page displays text fields with automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. On Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these text fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields should be displayed as readonly labels instead of input fields. This way, their values can still be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": ""}
