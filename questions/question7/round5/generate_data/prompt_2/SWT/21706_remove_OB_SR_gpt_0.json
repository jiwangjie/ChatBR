Since there are no non-static methods in this class, it would be a good practice to prevent people from instantiating the class when there is no need to. This modification will not increase the size of the class, as the compiler automatically adds a free public constructor. Instead, it will make the constructor private instead of public.", "SR": "1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 module.\n2. Add a private constructor to the class.\n3. Verify that the class no longer contains the usage of Class.forName()."}
