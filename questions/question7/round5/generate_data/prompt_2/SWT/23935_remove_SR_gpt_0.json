{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When running the attached code on build 20020920, the left tree and text behave as they should on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run the attached code on build 20020920.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gets focus and the text does not lose focus on Linux.\n4. Compare the behavior with the left tree and text on both Windows and Linux."}
