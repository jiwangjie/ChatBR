This issue is noticeable on all motif platforms. On Windows, the appearance is fine.\n\nOn motif platforms, the text fields have automatic borders, which make them appear as user input targets. Furthermore, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these text fields have different background colors, making them stand out even more.", "OB": "On motif platforms (ex. Solaris/AIX/HPUX), the Project Properties Info page incorrectly displays text fields with automatic borders, giving the perception that they can be edited by the user. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, the text fields have different colored backgrounds, further emphasizing their presence.", "EB": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. Instead, a different UI element should be implemented to display the required information without giving the impression that the fields can be edited.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the application on a motif platform (ex. Solaris/AIX/HPUX).\n2. Navigate to the Project Properties Info page.\n3. Observe the presence of text fields with automatic borders and different colored backgrounds.\n\nExpected result:\nThe Project Properties Info page should not use text fields and should display the required information using a different UI element."}
