{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 version contains a line that uses Class.forName() which causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT. This can cause issues when using jxeLink or similar tools. It would be ideal to remove the reflection and replace it with a private constructor. Currently, the class does not have any nonstatic methods, so there is no need to instantiate it. Making the constructor private will prevent unnecessary instantiation without adding any size to the class.", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 version has a line that uses Class.forName() which throws a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "The BidiUtil class should be modified to remove the usage of Class.forName() and add a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instantiation.", "SR": "1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 version of SWT.\n2. Locate the line with the usage of Class.forName().\n3. Remove this line and replace it with a private constructor.\n4. Save the changes and test using the CLDC version of SWT."}
