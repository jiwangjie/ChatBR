{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example are enabled, but they don't have any effect. This is misleading, especially when opening a small image like an icon, as the scrollbars don't do anything.", "OB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example are enabled, but they don't have any effect. They can be moved around, but there is no change in the displayed image.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled. They should not be able to move and should not be present in the user interface.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect on the displayed image.\n4. Open a small image, such as an icon, and observe that the scrollbars are misleading as they do not do anything."}
