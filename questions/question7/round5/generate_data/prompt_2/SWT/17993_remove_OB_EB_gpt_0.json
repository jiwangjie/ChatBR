{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace field replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "Currently, when typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the input is being replaced with a value from the search history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, but it might be better to prevent the replacement of typed entries with values from the history. In the future, a complete autocomplete feature could be added.", "OB": "When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the input is replaced with a value from the search history.", "EB": "When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the search history.", "SR": "1. Open the Edit menu and select Find/Replace...\n2. In the Find field, type 'a' and click 'Find'.\n3. Try to type 'A' into the Find field. The typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the search history."}
