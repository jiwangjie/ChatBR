Integration build 09/17. Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms (such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX), the Project Properties Info page displays text fields instead of labels. These text fields have automatic borders which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, these text fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields on the Project Properties Info page should be changed to readonly labels instead. This will eliminate the automatic borders and the different colored backgrounds. I believe this change is necessary so that users can select and copy the values from these fields.", "SR": ""}
