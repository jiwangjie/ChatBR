Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which further emphasizes them.", "EB": "Instead of using text fields, the Project Properties Info page should use readonly labels. This will make the page look consistent across platforms and make it clear that the information displayed cannot be edited. I assume that the text fields were used to allow users to select and copy their values.", "SR": ""}
