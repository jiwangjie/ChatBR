{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when you click on the tree, even on Linux.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to a screen where a Tree widget and a Text widget are present as children of the Shell.\n3. Click anywhere on the Tree widget.\n4. Check if the Tree widget gains focus, and the Text widget loses focus."}
