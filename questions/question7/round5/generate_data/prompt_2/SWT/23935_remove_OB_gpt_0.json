{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "Currently, when clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus and does not release focus when clicked outside of the tree.", "EB": "In build 20020920, running the attached code, the left tree and text behave correctly on both Windows and Linux platforms.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, click anywhere in the tree. Observe that the tree gains focus and does not lose focus when clicking outside of the tree."}
