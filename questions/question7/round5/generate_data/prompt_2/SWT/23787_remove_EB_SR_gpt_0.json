The appearance of the text fields on Motif platforms is not consistent with the expected design. When viewing the properties dialog on Motif platforms, the text fields have automatic borders, which make them appear as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "OB": "On Motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders and do not match the expected design.
