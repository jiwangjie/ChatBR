{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace function, the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "When using the Find/Replace function, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. It should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed and should respect the case of the user's input.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Navigate to Edit -> Find/Replace...\n3. Observe that the typed entry in the Find field is replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Perform the desired find and replace operations.\n5. Observe that the behavior is not respecting the case of the user's input.\n6. Repeat the same steps for the Replace With field to observe a similar behavior."}
