The source path in the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\". This issue can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. Please note that these tests may produce false positives as filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. Additionally, in some cases, the filenames may not appear at all.", "OB": "The source path in the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\".
