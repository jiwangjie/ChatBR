To reproduce the problem, please run the code in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'. Note that the tests have some limitations: they may give false positives because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. Additionally, AJDT may omit the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath listed in the declare warning messages appears in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that filenames sometimes do not appear at all, although this problem is not reproduced by the provided tests.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
