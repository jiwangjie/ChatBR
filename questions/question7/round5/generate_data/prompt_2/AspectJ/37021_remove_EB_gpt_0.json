The current code in the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory demonstrates the problem. Note that there are some limitations with these tests, as they may produce false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in the harness verification of messages. I observed this issue in AJDT, where the filename seemed to be omitted when it didn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "In declare warning messages that target .class files from injars, the sourcepath is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes, the filenames don't appear at all, although these particular tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run declare warning messages that target .class files from injars. Note that the sourcepath is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
