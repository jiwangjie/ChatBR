The problem can be observed by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. The current tests have limitations and may produce false positives because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it seems that the filename is simply omitted when it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, create declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars. The source path should be listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
