This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nOB: The Test.class file is then put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory. This means running the java command results in the following error:\n   Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nEB: It will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.\n\nSR: To fix the problem, run ajc with the -d option, like this:\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java"}
