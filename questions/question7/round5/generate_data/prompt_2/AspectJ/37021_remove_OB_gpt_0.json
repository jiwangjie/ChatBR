See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the issue. These tests have limitations and may provide false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, if the filename doesn't make sense, AJDT may simply omit it.", "OB": "This bug report does not provide the observed behavior.", "EB": "In declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the format 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code from tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Observe the declare warning messages and note that the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
