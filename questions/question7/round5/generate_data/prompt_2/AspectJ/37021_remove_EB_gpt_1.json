{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path in declare warning messages incorrect for binary files", "description": "When declaring warning messages for binary files (.class files) using the 'declare warning' feature, the source path is displayed incorrectly. It is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that in some cases, the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that particular issue.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for binary files is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Additionally, in some cases, the filenames do not appear at all.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Run a test case involving the use of 'declare warning' targeting .class files from injars.\n2. Observe the source path listed in the warning message.\n3. Verify that it is displayed in the correct form 'app/Main' and not 'app.Main.class'.\n4. If possible, also check for cases where the filenames do not appear in the warning messages."}
