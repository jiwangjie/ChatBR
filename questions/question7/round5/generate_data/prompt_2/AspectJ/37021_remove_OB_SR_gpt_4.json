When running the tests in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory, the problem can be observed. It should be noted that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. This issue was identified in AJDT, where it seems that if the filename is nonsensical to AJDT, it is omitted.", "OB": "No observed behavior statement provided.", "EB": "In declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is incorrectly listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "SR": "1. Navigate to the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory.\n2. Run the code in this directory.\n3. Observe the declare warning messages.\n4. Note that the source paths listed for .class files from injars are in the wrong format."}
