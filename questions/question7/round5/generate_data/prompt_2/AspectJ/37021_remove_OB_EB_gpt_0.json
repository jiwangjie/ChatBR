{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When using declare warning on binary files in [java|aj], the source path is incorrect. To reproduce the issue, refer to the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. Limitations of the test: When harness verification of messages is performed, filename checking is not enabled, which may result in false positives. It seems that AJDT might omit the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "No observed behavior is mentioned in the bug report.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Compile a .class file from the 'app.Main' class.\n2. Use declare warning on the binary file.\n3. Observe that the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.'"}
