{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The issue occurs when using the 'ajc' command with the 'outjar' parameter to create a jar file. The resulting jar file does not include a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I call 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>', it creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, this file is not a valid jar because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. I noticed that the 'ajc' documentation states: 'outjar <file> Put output classes in zip file <file>', which suggests that it should create a zip file. However, having a parameter named 'outjar' that creates a zip file seems contradictory.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'ajc' command with the 'outjar' parameter creates a valid jar file, which includes a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>'. Verify that the output file is created with a .jar extension, but does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
