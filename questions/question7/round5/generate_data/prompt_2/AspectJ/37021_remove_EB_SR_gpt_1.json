To reproduce this issue, navigate to tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory and run the code provided to observe the problem. Please note that these tests may generate false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in the harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it appears that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it may be omitted. ", "OB": "In declare warning messages that target .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Additionally, there are cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these particular tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
