I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nA directory named \"subpackage\" is created within the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe compiled class file should be placed in the existing \"subpackage\" directory, without creating a nested subdirectory.\n\nNote: This behavior differs from the behavior of the javac compiler.\n\n", "OB": "A directory named \"subpackage\" is created within the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "The compiled class file should be placed in the existing \"subpackage\" directory, without creating a nested subdirectory.", "SR": "1.
