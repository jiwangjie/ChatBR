{"id": "47910", "title": "ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc with the outjar option, the resulting jarfile does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc suggests that the outjar option should create a zip file, but a jar file without a manifest is not a valid jar file.", "OB": "I called ajc with the sourceroots option, specifying the source directory, and the outjar option, specifying the output jar file. The command completed successfully and created an output file with a .jar extension. However, when I inspected the file, I noticed that it did not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The resulting file created when using the outjar option should be a valid jar file, which includes a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run ajc with the sourceroots option, specifying the directory containing the source files.\n2. Include the outjar option, specifying the output jar file.\n3. Inspect the resulting jarfile and verify that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
