This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage:\n\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior: The command creates a directory \"subpackage\" within the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\nExpected Behavior: The command should create the directory structure corresponding to the package hierarchy.\n\nThis behavior deviates from javac where the command does not create an additional directory.\n\nIt would be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "OB": "The ajc command creates a directory \"subpackage\" within the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "The ajc command should create the directory structure corresponding to the package hierarchy.", "SR": "Use the -d option when compiling classes from a subpackage."}
