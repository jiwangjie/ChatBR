To reproduce the issue, refer to the code located in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'. Please note that these tests may produce false positives as filename checking is disabled during harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it seems that if the filename does not make sense, AJDT simply omits it.", "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Occasionally, the filenames may not appear at all although these tests do not replicate that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run the code located in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' that triggers the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.\n2. Observe that the sourcepath is listed as 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main' in the declare warning messages."}
