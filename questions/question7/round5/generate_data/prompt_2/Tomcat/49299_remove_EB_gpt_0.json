{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Incorrect behavior with custom session tracking cookie name", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL, assuming URL rewriting is enabled. However, this is not true in the current trunk version. The default 'jsessionid' parameter is used instead. The attached war file demonstrates this issue.", "OB": "When accessing the page at http://localhost:8080/cookiename/, the following cookie is set: SetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. However, the 'Reload' link on the page uses the parameter 'jsessionid': http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "The reload link should use the custom cookie name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' instead of 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Deploy the attached war file named 'cookiename.war'. \n2. Access the page at http://localhost:8080/cookiename/."}
