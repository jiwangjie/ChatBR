There could be improvements made to how Tomcat is stopped, as using System.exit(0) should work regardless of the shutdown port setting. It is possible that jsvc may exhibit the same behavior, but this has not been tested.", "OB": "When the Tomcat service is started and stopped, an error message is printed when using port 1 as the shutdown port.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when using port 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat service.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service, and then stop the service. \n3. Shutdown the server through the OS signal by calling Catalina.stop()."}
