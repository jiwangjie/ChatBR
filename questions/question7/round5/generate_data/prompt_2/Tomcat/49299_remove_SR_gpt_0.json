{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Custom cookie name not affecting URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf document, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled). However, the observed behavior is different. The webpage sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' as the parameter name in the URL instead of the custom name.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nHowever, the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' in the URL: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "Expected behavior is that the 'Reload' link should use the custom cookie name as specified in section 7.1.1 of the documentation.
