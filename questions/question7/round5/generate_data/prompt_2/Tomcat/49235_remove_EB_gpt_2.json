Currently, the output is \"MySomeAnn\", but it should be \"MySomeClass\". This issue is not yet addressed in the Servlet 3.0 specification. My code works fine on Glassfish 3.0.

Build Tomcat 7.0.0 from SVN r939221.\n2. Use the following code:\n\n@MySomeAnn\npublic class MySomeClass{\n...}\n\n@HandlesTypes(MySomeAnn.class)\npublic class ModuleInitializer implements ServletContainerInitializer{\n    @Override\n    public void onStartup(Set<Class<?>> classSet, ServletContext ctx) throws ServletException{\n        for (Class<?> targetClass : classSet){\n            System.out.println(targetClass.getName());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n3. Execute the code and observe that the output is \"MySomeAnn\" instead of \"MySomeClass\"."}
