{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g. port 80). This issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await(). To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully. 2. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. 3. Actual behavior: The exception does not occur because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It only binds when start() is called. 4. Expected behavior: In StandardService.initInternal(), the connector.init() call should fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, rethrown. Then it should be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports.", "EB": "In StandardService.initInternal(), the connector.init() call should fail because it cannot bind to the port.", "SR": "1.
