{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Error message printed when using port 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3, the Tomcat server works as expected. However, an error message is printed. It would be better to improve the shutdown process of Tomcat by using wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken up by a notifyAll() call or use interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread). This behavior may also be observed with jsvc, but it has not been tested yet.", "OB": "When using port 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, an error message is printed.", "EB": "When using port 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, no error message should be printed.", "SR": "1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3.\n2. Run the Tomcat server as a Windows service.\n3. Observe the error message printed when stopping the Tomcat server."}
