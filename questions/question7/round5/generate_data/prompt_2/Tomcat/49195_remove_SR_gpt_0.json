That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat is still successfully stopped despite this message. After printing the message, Catalina.stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. When the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await() method, so that it could be woken up by a notifyAll() call, or use an interrupt() call to wake it up if we know the thread.", "SR": ""}
