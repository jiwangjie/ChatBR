{"id": "49195", "title": "Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "When specifying a shutdown port of 1 in server.xml, Tomcat still stops successfully but prints an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message is: 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, this message does not affect the server shutdown process, as Tomcat still stops regardless of it. The Catalina stopServer() method performs a System.exit(1) after printing the message, resulting in a shutdown. It should be noted that the behavior regarding jsvc is not known as it has not been tested.", "OB": "The catalina.20100427.log file prints the following error message: 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Try to shut down the server through an OS signal by calling Catalina.stop()."}
