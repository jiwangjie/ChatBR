Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this issue supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate methods Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstart.start() [1]. This issue essentially breaks the fix for BZ 48625. \n\nTo reproduce:\n1.
