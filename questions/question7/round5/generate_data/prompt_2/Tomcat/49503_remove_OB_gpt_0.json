{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, this bug affects Tomcat 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. This bug breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "Currently, it is observed that Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start().", "EB": "Expected behavior: I would expect that in StandardService.initInternal() the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug, please add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true. Then start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
