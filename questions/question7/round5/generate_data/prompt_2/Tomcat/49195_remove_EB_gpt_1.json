That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using the port number 1 as the shutdown port for Tomcat running as a Windows service, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat stops regardless of this error message. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() function performs System.exit(1), which results in Tomcat shutdown. It is worth noting that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal (e.g., by calling Catalina.stop())."}
