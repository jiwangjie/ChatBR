{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the observed behavior is that the Reload link on the page still uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name. An attachment named 'cookiename.war' is provided for reference.", "OB": "When visiting the page, the following cookie is sent:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nHowever, the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid'.\n\nURL: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4", "EB": "Expected behavior: If the phrase in 7.1.1 is to be followed, the Reload link should be:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": ""}
