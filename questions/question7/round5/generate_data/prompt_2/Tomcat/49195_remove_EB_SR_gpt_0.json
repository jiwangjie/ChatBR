There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.

Server not shut down. It is only a message and does not actually prevent Tomcat from stopping. After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It appears that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "The error message 'No shutdown port configured.
