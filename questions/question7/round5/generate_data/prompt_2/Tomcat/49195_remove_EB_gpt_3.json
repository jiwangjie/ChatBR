{"id": "49195", "title": "Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "When running a Tomcat server as a Windows service and specifying the shutdown port as '1' in the server.xml configuration file, Tomcat stops successfully but prints an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message is as follows: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServerSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this message, Tomcat is actually stopped because the Catalina.stopServer() method calls System.exit(1) after printing the message. It should be noted that when stopping Tomcat through the service launcher, the Catalina server object is not null.", "OB": "When running Tomcat as a Windows service and using '1' as the shutdown port, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file saying that there is no shutdown port configured and the server was not shut down. However, Tomcat actually stops successfully despite this error message.", "EB": "When running Tomcat as a Windows service and using '1' as the shutdown port, the error message about the missing shutdown port configuration should not be printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. Tomcat should still stop successfully.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling the Catalina.stop() method."}
