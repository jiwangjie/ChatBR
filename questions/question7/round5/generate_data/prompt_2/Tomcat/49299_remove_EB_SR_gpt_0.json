The actual behavior observed is that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' but the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name.", "EB": "The web application should use the custom name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' as the name of the URI parameter for session id encoding in the URL when URL rewriting is enabled.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Enable URL rewriting in the web application.\n2. Configure a custom name for the session tracking cookies.\n3. Access the web application and navigate to a page.\n4. Observe the cookie name sent by the page and the name used in the Reload link URL."}
