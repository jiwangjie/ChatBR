{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message displayed when using port 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, it is possible to differentiate between two use cases. However, when stopping Tomcat, an error message is displayed. It would be better to improve the shutdown process by using wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it can be woken up by a notifyAll() call or using the interrupt() method to wake up the specific thread. This behavior may also be exhibited by jsvc, but I have not tested it.", "OB": "Upon stopping the Tomcat service with port 1 specified in server.xml, an error message is displayed.", "EB": "When stopping the Tomcat service with port 1 specified in server.xml, no error message should be displayed.", "SR": "To replicate the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Shut down the server using an OS signal, e.g., call Catalina.stop() from the command line."}
