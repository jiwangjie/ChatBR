However, the exception list eventually comes up, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The process of adding an exception breakpoint should honor the cancellation request. The progress dialog should not close immediately when cancellation is requested. Alternatively, the cancel button should be disabled during the process. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run method, the `canceleable` parameter should be set to `false`.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the application\n2. Navigate to the breakpoints section\n3. Add a new exception breakpoint\n4. Attempt to cancel the process\n\nExpected result:\n- The process of adding an exception breakpoint should be cancelled, and the progress dialog should not close immediately.\n\nActual result:\n- The progress dialog closes immediately, and the exception list eventually comes up, ignoring the cancellation request."}
