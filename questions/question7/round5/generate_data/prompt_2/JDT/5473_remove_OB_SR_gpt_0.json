{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "When using ShiftLeft with intermixed tabs and spaces, there is an issue with the behavior. Build 200110251.", "OB": "When a line starts with a tab character and another line starts with spaces, executing the ShiftLeft command does not produce the expected result. Instead of shifting both lines left, only the second line is shifted left while the first line remains unchanged.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that both lines should be shifted left when executing the ShiftLeft command. To achieve this, the tab character in the first line should be replaced with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same way. Additionally, if there is a stray space, it should be removed during the indentation process to avoid confusion.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document with a line starting with a tab character and another line starting with spaces.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n3. Observe that only the second line is shifted left, while the first line remains unchanged."}
