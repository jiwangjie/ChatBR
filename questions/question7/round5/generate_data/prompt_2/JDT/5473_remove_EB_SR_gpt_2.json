", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, executing the ShiftLeft command in the text editor results in the text moving unexpectedly. It is not clear how the behavior is specified, but in the first scenario it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Regardless, it is confusing if there is a stray space, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After executing the ShiftLeft command, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should also be shifted left until reaching the space character, removing any tabs or stray spaces.", "SR": "1. Open a text editor.\n2. Enter two lines of text, where the first line starts with a tab character and the second line starts with spaces.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n4. Observe the results and ensure the second line is shifted left and the first line has been shifted left until reaching the space character, removing any tabs or stray spaces."}
