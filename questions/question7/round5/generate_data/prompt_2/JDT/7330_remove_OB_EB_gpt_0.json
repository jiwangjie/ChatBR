{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions available on text selection seem to be distributed based on personal preference. This makes it unclear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view just to access certain actions. We need to make all actions reachable from the editor, for example, through the Edit menu.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available when selecting text in the editor.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be available when selecting text in the editor.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the Edit menu or context menu (right-click menu)."}
