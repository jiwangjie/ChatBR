As a result, when the output location is set first, it creates an illegal state.", "OB": "When clicking 'Ok' after setting the output location to /xy and classpath to /xy/src, the following error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "Upon clicking 'Ok', the output location and classpath should be set in one operation without causing an illegal state.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Change the source folder setting to use the project as the source folder.\n4. Change the output location setting to use the project as the output location."}
