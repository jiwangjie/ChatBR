{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When setting the output location and classpath in an IDE, currently these two operations are separate. However, this creates an illegal state. The error message displayed is: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "OB": "After pressing 'Ok' in the dialog, the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src' is displayed.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, the setting of the classpath and output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process. Additionally, the error message displayed should be revised to 'Cannot nest /xy/src inside /xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, follow these steps: \n1. Open the IDE. \n2. Go to the settings or preferences menu. \n3. Look for the options to set the classpath and output location. \n4. Set the classpath and output location separately. \n5. Press 'Ok' to apply the changes. \n6. Observe the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
