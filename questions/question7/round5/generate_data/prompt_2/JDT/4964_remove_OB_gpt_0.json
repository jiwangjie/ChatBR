{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with `button.DISPOSED` which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a `(` and that this matches `dispose()` far better than `DISPOSED`. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When writing SWT code, I type `button.dispose`.", "EB": "The code assist should suggest `dispose()` instead of `DISPOSED`.", "SR": "1. Open the SWT code editor.\n2. Type `button.dispose` without looking at the code assist options."}
