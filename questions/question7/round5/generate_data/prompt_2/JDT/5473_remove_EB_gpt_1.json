{"id": "5474", "title": "ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "The ShiftLeft behavior is incorrect when there are intermixed tabs and spaces in the text. In Build 200110251, when the first line has a tab character and the second line has spaces, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text as expected. It is unclear how the behavior is specified, but in this scenario, it should shift the second line left and remove the tab from the first line, at least until the first space character. The current behavior is confusing, as it gives no indication of why the text doesn't shift when there is a stray space.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n   Note: Replace <space> with a space character and <tab> with a tab character.\n3. Highlight the two lines.\n4. Execute ShiftLeft and observe that nothing moves.", "OB": "The text does not shift when executing ShiftLeft with intermixed tabs and spaces.", "EB": "When executing ShiftLeft with intermixed tabs and spaces, the second line should be shifted left and the tab should be removed from the first line.", "SR": "1.
