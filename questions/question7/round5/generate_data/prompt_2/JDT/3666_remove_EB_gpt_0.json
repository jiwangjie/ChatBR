In the given example class, the programmer needs to add a parameter to the `baz` call in `bar` to make the program correct.", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\n```java\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n```I would rather it gave me\n\n```java\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n```public class X {\n  void bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo());\n  }\n\n  int foo() {\n    return 5;\n  }\n\n  void baz(int i, int j) {\n  }\n}", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Change the `baz` call to\n\n```java\nbaz(x.x.foo())\n```\n\n2. Place the cursor after the first \"x.\" in the modified `baz` call.\n3. Press `Ctrl + Space` to bring up code assist.\n4. Type \"f\" to filter the list.\n5. Select \"foo()\" from the code assist list.\n6. Observe the behavior."}
