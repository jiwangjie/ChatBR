I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference, which is confusing for users. It is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view in order to access certain actions.", "OB": "When I selected text, the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' was not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the context menu when I selected text.", "SR": "1. Open the editor and select some text. 2. Right-click to open the context menu and verify if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available."}
