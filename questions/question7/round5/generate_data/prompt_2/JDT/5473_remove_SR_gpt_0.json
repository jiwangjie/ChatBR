It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). It is confusing when there is a stray space because it is not clear why the text does not shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually align the two lines, executing the ShiftLeft command should shift the text left. In the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). It should be ensured that any stray space does not interfere with the expected behavior, as it is currently confusing when the text does not shift.", "SR": "1.

It is recommended to specify the expected behavior for this scenario to avoid confusion."}
