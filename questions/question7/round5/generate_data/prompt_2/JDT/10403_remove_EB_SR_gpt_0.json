{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should check if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. Currently, we don't have this check and users can select a bin directory as the output folder.", "EB": "After selecting an existing directory structure for a project, the system should confirm if the selected output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. If the directory contains important files other than .class files that cannot be recreated from available .java files, an error message should be displayed prompting the user to select a different output directory before proceeding with the project creation.", "SR": "1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Select an existing directory structure.\n3. Enter a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n5. Verify that a confirmation message is displayed indicating that the selected output directory can be deleted and rebuilt.\n6. If the selected directory contains important non-recreatable files, an error message should be displayed instead of the confirmation message."}
