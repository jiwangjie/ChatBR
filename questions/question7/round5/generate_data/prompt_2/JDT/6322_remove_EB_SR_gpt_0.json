{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322 - All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "When using JDK 1.4, the Open Type dialog displays obfuscated classes (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') alongside other classes.", "OB": "The obfuscated classes appear prominently in the Open Type dialog.", "EB": "The Open Type dialog should not display obfuscated classes, and should only show relevant and non-obfuscated classes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Open Type dialog.\n2. Observe the presence of obfuscated classes (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') in the list.\n3. Expectedly, only non-obfuscated and relevant classes should be shown in the list."}
