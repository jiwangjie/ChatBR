The buttons in the dialog are too small. b. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled. c. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off. d. The dialog comes up very large for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "The buttons in the dialog should be larger. When the dialog comes up, a table entry should be selected. Only the move buttons relevant to the selected table entry should be enabled.

Open the parameter modification dialog. 2. Try changing the name of a parameter to something very long. 3. Observe that the preview of the parameter name is cut off."}
