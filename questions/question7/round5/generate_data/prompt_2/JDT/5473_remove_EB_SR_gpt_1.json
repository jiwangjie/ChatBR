Specifically, when there is a tab character in the first line and spaces in the second line, if I replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, and then execute the ShiftLeft command, the text does not move as expected. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in this scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab. However, it is confusing when there is a stray space, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
