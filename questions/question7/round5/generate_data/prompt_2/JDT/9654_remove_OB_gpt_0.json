{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters: Dialog details", "description": "When modifying parameters in the dialog, the following issues were observed:\ni. Duplicated name validation is not performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second column in the dialog are not properly merged.\n\nThe expected behavior is as follows:\n\na. The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog.\n\nb. The table should have a label so it can be assigned a mnemonic.\n\nc. Multiple selection should be allowed in the list, as move up / down functionality can be applied to more than one item.\n\nd. The signature preview must be a label that wraps text. It would be nice if the signature preview has the same background color as a hover effect.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Open the dialog to modify parameters.\n2. Try changing a parameter name to something very long and observe that the preview is cut off.", "OB": "Duplicated name validation is not performed on the first page.\nThe first and second column in the dialog are not properly merged.", "EB": "The marking between the button and list is too large.
