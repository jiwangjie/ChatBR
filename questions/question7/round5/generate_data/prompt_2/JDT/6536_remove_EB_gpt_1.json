{"id": "6536", "title": "Bug 6536: Add Javadoc on field in Type Hierarchy does nothing", "description": "When attempting to add Javadoc to a field in the Type Hierarchy view, selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu does not have any effect. The expected behavior is that this action should add Javadoc to the selected field. It is recommended that either the 'Add Javadoc' option be removed from the context menu, or that the action be fixed to properly add Javadoc to the fields.", "OB": "When I select a field in the Type Hierarchy view and choose the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu, nothing happens.", "EB": "After selecting a field in the Type Hierarchy view and choosing the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu, the Javadoc should be successfully added to the selected field.", "SR": "1. Open the Type Hierarchy view\n2. Select a field in the view\n3. Right-click on the selected field\n4. From the context menu, choose the 'Add Javadoc' option"}
