{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When attempting to set the output location and classpath simultaneously, an error message is displayed stating 'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This occurs because setting the output location and classpath are currently separate operations, and setting the output location first causes an illegal state.", "OB": "When pressing Ok, the error message 'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src' is displayed.", "EB": "When setting the classpath and output location, the two operations should be combined into one cohesive action, preventing the creation of an illegal state.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the project settings. \n2. Set the output location to /xy. \n3. Set the classpath to /xy/src. \n4. Press Ok. \n5. Observe the error message 'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
