{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters Dialog Details", "description": "The Modify Parameters dialog details need to be modified. Specifically:\n- The duplicated name validation should be performed on the first page.\n- The first and second columns should be merged.\n\nCurrently, the following issues are observed:\n- The buttons are too small.\n- When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n- When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n- The dialog comes up as huge for methods with many parameters.", "OB": "1. The buttons are too small.\n2. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n3. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n4. The dialog comes up as huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "1. The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\n2. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n3. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up/down can be applied on more than one item.\n4. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": ""}
