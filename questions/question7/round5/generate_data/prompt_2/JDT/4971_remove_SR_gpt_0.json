{"id": "4971", "title": "Strange 'copy package' behavior", "description": "When performing a 'copy package' operation in the 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui' plugin in jdt.ui, the destination package is not being copied correctly. Instead of copying the entire package 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui', only the last part 'ui' is copied. This behavior is observed when selecting 'xxx' as the destination package.", "OB": "As a result of the 'copy package' operation, the package 'ui' is present in the destination package 'xx'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the entire package 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui' should be copied to the destination package 'xx'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui' plugin in jdt.ui. 2. Perform a 'copy package' operation. 3. Select 'xxx' as the destination package. 4. Verify that only the package 'ui' is copied to the destination package 'xx' instead of 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui'."}
