There is a duplicated name validation that could be performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second column in the dialog are not merged properly.\n\n", "OB": "1. There is a large gap between the button and the list.\n2. The top button in the dialog is not aligned with the top of the dialog.\n3. The table in the dialog does not have a label, so it cannot contain a mnemonic.\n4. Multiple selection is not allowed in the list. Move up / down can only be applied to one item at a time.\n5. The signature preview is not displayed properly. It should be a label that wraps the text.\n6. The signature preview does not have the same background color as a hover effect.\n", "EB": "1.
