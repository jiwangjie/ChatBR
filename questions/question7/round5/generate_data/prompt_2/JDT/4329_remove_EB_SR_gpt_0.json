However, this search does not return any results. It should first try to retrieve the Java element and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name. It is worth noting that search via context menu in the packages view works without any issues.", "EB": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog, the search should return relevant results by trying to retrieve the Java element first and falling back to displaying the element name if retrieving the Java element fails.", "SR": "1. Open the Package view.\n2. Right-click on a package.\n3. Select 'Search' from the context menu.\n4. In the search dialog that appears, ensure that the fully qualified name is displayed.\n5. Enter a search term and press Enter.\n6. Verify that the search returns the relevant results based on the entered search term. If no results are shown, confirm that the search also tries to retrieve the Java element and falls back to displaying the element name if necessary."}
