It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab). It is confusing if there is a stray space because it makes it unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n  <space>\n  <tab>some text\n  <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n- Notice that nothing moves."}
