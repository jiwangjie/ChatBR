At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose().

Notice that the code assist list appears, but do not actively look at it\n4. Type '('\n5. Observe that the code assist automatically inserts incorrect code"}
