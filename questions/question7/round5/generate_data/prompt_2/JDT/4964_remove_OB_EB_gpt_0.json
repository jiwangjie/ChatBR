Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose", "EB": "When I type 'button.dispose' and the code assist list is up, I expect the code assist to suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Open the specific build 204 of the application.\n2. Write SWT code that includes 'button.dispose' in it.\n3. Observe the code assist suggest 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()' when the code assist list is up."}
