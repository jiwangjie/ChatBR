{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the program is eating too much code. For example, in the given class, to make the program correct, a parameter needs to be added to the 'baz' call in 'bar'. However, when using code assist, it is adding too much code instead of just the necessary parameter. The code is changed to:\n\n```java\nvoid bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo().foo());\n}\n\nint foo() {\n    return 5;\n}\n\nvoid baz(int i, int j) {\n}\n```\n\nThis is not the expected behavior. The expected behavior is that code assist should only add the necessary parameter to the 'baz' call, like this:\n\n```java\nvoid bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.x.foo());\n}\n```", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\n```java\nvoid bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo().foo());\n}\n```", "EB": "The code should be changed to:\n\n```java\nvoid bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.x.foo());\n}\n```", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n\n1. Change the 'baz' call to 'baz(x.x.foo())'\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list\n5. Select 'foo()'"}
