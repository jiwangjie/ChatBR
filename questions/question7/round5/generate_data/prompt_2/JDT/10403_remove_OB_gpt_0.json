{"id": "10403", "title": "Project creation does not confirm that the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When creating a new project for an existing directory structure, the confirmation process does not check if the output directory(bin) can be deleted and rebuilt. This issue is causing some users to create projects and select the output folder as a bin directory which contains more than just .class files and cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "Currently, when creating a project for an existing directory structure and selecting a bin directory as the output folder, there is no confirmation or warning message displayed.", "EB": "When creating a project for an existing directory structure and selecting a bin directory as the output folder, a confirmation prompt should appear to verify that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the project creation wizard.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure as the project location.\n3. Select a bin directory that contains additional files besides .class files as the output folder.\n4. Continue with the project creation process and observe that no confirmation prompt is displayed."}
