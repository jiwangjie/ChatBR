Currently, I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. I think the actions are distributed based on personal taste, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "When I select text in the editor, the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available when I selected text.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Select some text in the editor. 2. Check the Edit menu for the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action."}
