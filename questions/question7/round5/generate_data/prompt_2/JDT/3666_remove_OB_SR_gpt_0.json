{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Bug 3666: Code Completion Hungry code assist (1GDRYW5) \n\n Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the UI eats too much code. This can be observed when working with the enclosed class.\n\n As a programmer, when I add a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method, the code produced by the code assist is incorrect.\n\n Steps to Reproduce:\n\n 1. Open the UI and enable the code assist feature.\n 2. Edit the 'bar' method in the enclosed class by adding another parameter to the 'baz' call.\n 3. Observe that the code assist adds the parameter in the wrong place, causing a compilation error.\n\n Expected Behavior:\n\n The code assist should produce the following code: \n\n baz(x.foo().foo()) \n\n With this correction, the resulting class should be as follows:\n\npublic class X {\n\tvoid bar(X x) {\n\t\tbaz(x.foo().foo());\n\t}\n\tint foo() {\n\t\treturn 5;\n\t}\n\tvoid baz(int i, int j) {\n\t}\n}", "OB": "The code assist currently produces: \n\n baz(x.foo()) \n\n This is incorrect because it is missing the second 'foo()' method call in the 'baz' parameter.", "EB": "The code is changed to: \n\n baz(x.foo().foo()) \n\n This correction ensures that the code is valid and will compile successfully.", "SR": "1.
