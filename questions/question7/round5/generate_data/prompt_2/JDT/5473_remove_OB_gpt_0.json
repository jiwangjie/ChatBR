When executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). It is currently confusing because the presence of a stray space prevents the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nNote that nothing moves as expected."}
