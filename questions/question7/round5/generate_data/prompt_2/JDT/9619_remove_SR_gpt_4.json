Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes). 2. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. 3. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. 4. Destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'. 2.
