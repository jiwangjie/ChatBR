{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "The bug report describes the issue correctly.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the IDE should display a confirmation dialog. This dialog should inform the user that the output directory will be deleted and rebuilt. The dialog should also mention that if the output folder is pointing to a bin directory, it should only contain .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the IDE.\n2. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n3. Set the output folder to a bin directory that contains files other than .class.\n4. Check if the IDE displays a confirmation dialog mentioning that the output directory will be deleted and rebuilt and warns about non-.class files in the bin directory."}
