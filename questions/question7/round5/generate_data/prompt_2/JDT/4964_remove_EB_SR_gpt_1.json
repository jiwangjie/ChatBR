{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist not considering context", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type '(', the automatic code assist inserts whatever is selected. Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I end up with 'button.DISPOSED', which isn't what I want. I have to delete it and start over, paying closer attention to the code assist list. Code assist should notice that I have typed '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' much better than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "Build 204", "EB": "When I type 'button.dispose(' followed by '(', the automatic code assist should insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Open a new SWT project in Build 204.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. At this point, do not actively look at the code assist list.\n4. Type '('.\n5. Observe that the automatic code assist inserts 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'."}
