When adding a parameter to the baz call in the bar method, the code assist replaces more code than necessary. \n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the enclosed class.\n2. In the bar method, add a parameter to the baz call.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe code should only replace the necessary code for the parameter addition.\n\nObserved behavior:\nThe code assist replaces more code than necessary. The code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me\n\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n   void bar(X x) {\n      baz(x.foo());\n   }\n   int foo() {\n      return 5;\n   }\n   void baz(int i, int j) {\n   }\n}\n", "OB": "The code is changed to: baz(x.foo().foo())\nI would rather it gave me: baz(x.foo()x.foo())", "EB": "The code should only replace the necessary code for the parameter addition.\n\nThe code is changed to: baz(x.foo().foo())\nI would rather it gave me: baz(x.foo()x.foo())", "SR": "1.
