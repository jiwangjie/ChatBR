{"id": "6322", "title": "All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "When using JDK 1.4, the All types dialog in the code editor is displaying obfuscated class names such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc. This makes it difficult to identify and select the desired classes.", "OB": "The All types dialog is showing obfuscated class names.", "EB": "The All types dialog should only display meaningful and non-obfuscated class names.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the code editor.\n2. Open the All types dialog.\n3. Observe the list of class names and notice the presence of obfuscated class names.\n\nTo fix the issue:\n1. Sort the class names in the All types dialog so that lower case class names are placed after the ones that start with a capital letter.\nOR\n2. Implement a filter to exclude obfuscated class names completely from the All types dialog."}
