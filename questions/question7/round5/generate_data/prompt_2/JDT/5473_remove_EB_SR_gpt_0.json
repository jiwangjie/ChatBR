It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab character). However, it is confusing if there is a stray space because it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
