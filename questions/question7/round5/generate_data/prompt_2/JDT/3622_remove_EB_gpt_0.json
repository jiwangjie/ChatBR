{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622: New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "The New Package Wizard displays a confusing message when the package name field is empty. The message states 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even though the package name field is empty. This message is unclear and it is not clear if it is an error or a warning. The user is unsure how to create a default package since it cannot be created by the user, as it is always there.", "OB": "When invoking the New Package Wizard and leaving the package name field empty, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "1. When invoking the New Package Wizard and leaving the package name field empty, no message should be displayed.\n2. If it is necessary to display a message, make sure it is clear and accurate.\n3. If it is a warning, consider displaying it in a more noticeable way (e.g., using red color and an error icon).\n4. Provide clear instructions on how to create a default package if it cannot be created by the user.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new Java Project.\n2. Select the project.\n3. Invoke the New Package Wizard.\n4. Leave the package name field empty."}
