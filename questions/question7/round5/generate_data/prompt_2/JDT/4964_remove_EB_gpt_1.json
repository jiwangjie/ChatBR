{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose(). I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type '(' then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "OB": "When typing 'button.dispose', code assist inserts the item 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.", "EB": "When typing 'button.dispose', code assist should notice that I have typed '(', and therefore, it should insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Observe that automatic code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.\n4. Type '(' after 'button.dispose'.\n5. Observe that automatic code assist inserts whatever is selected."}
