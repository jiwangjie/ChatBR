The issue occurs because setting the output location and classpath are currently two separate operations, creating an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location at once, both settings should be performed together. Additionally, the error message should be clearer and state: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
