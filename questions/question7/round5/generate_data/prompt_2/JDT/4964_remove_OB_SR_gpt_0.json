{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "When using the code assist feature, if I type a '(' after a variable name, the code assist should suggest the appropriate method based on the context. However, in my case, when I typed '(' after a variable called 'button', the code assist selected 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. This resulted in incorrect code being inserted, and I had to manually delete it and start again. \n\nTo resolve this, the code assist feature should be more intelligent and consider the context of the code being written. It should notice that I have typed a '(' and suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED', which is not even relevant in this context. Additionally, the code assist feature should also consider case sensitivity when automatically inserting code snippets.", "OB": "When I used the code assist feature to insert code after typing 'button.' and then '(' on the line below, the code assist suggested 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()', leading to incorrect code being inserted.", "EB": "The code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' based on the context of the code being written.
