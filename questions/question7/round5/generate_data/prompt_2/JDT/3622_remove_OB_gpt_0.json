{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a confusing message appears at the top even if the package name field is empty. The message states 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message does not provide clarity on its meaning and may be mistaken for an error. It should be clarified or removed. Additionally, there is a suggestion to have a default package created by the user, since it is always there but cannot be created manually.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard with an empty package name field, a message stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard with an empty package name field, no message should be displayed at the top.", "SR": "1. Create a new Java Project. 2. Select the project. 3. Invoke the New Java Package wizard."}
