{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately and the exception list still comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. The cancel button should either stop the process or disable the cancel button itself. This can be achieved by passing the parameter 'false' to the 'canceleable' parameter when calling 'ProgressMonitorDialog.run'.", "OB": "When trying to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately.", "EB": "The progress dialog should stay open and the process of adding the exception breakpoint should be cancelled.", "SR": "1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the J! button to add an exception. 3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
