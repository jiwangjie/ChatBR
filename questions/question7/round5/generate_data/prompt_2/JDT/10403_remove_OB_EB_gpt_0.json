{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Confirmation should be added when creating a project in an existing directory structure", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, no confirmation message is displayed.", "EB": "A confirmation message should be displayed when creating a project in an existing directory structure, informing the user that the output directory will be deleted and rebuilt. This is necessary because some users are pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains other files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure that contains a bin folder.\n3. Set the bin folder as the output directory.\n4. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n\nExpected result:\nA confirmation message should be displayed, informing the user that the output directory will be deleted and rebuilt.\n\nObserved result:\nNo confirmation message is displayed and the project is created without any indication that the output directory will be scrubbed."}
