{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When adding an exception breakpoint in the breakpoints pane of the debug perspective, cancelling the operation does not have any effect. The progress dialog closes immediately and eventually, the exception list comes up regardless of the cancellation request. The desired behavior is for the cancellation request to be honored, and either the operation should be cancelled or the cancel button should be disabled. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancellable parameter.", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint and clicking cancel in the progress dialog, the cancellation request is ignored and the progress dialog closes immediately.
