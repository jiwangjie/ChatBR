It does not have a private constructor.", "EB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 should have a private constructor. As there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it is unnecessary for it to be instantiated. Making the constructor private will prevent people from mistakenly instantiating the class. This change will not contribute any additional size to the code, as the compiler automatically provides a public constructor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the BidiUtil class in the win32 folder and check for the usage of Class.forName(). Additionally, verify that the class does not have a private constructor."}
