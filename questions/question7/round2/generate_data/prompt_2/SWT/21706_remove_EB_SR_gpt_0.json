However, this causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT, as the CLDC class libraries do not include this error class. The problem only occurs when using jxeLink or a similar tool, as the compiler assumes that the NoClassDefFoundError class is available. This bug report requests a modification to the code to remove the reflection and fix the issue.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
