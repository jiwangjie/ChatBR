{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When running the attached code with build 20020920, the left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux.", "SR": "1. Open the attached code with build 20020920.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gets focus and the text widget does not lose focus on Linux."}
