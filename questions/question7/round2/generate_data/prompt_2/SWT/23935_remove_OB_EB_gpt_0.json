{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus but the text widget does not lose focus.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when clicking anywhere in the tree.", "SR": "1. Open the application with the text widget and tree as children of the shell.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Verify that the tree gets focus and the text widget loses focus."}
