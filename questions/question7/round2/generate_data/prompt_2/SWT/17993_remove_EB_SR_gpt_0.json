{"id": "17993", "title": "Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous search entry is found in the history, it replaces the typed entry with that value. This behavior is similar to autocomplete commonly used in browsers. However, there should be an option to disable this behavior or provide a full autocomplete feature in the future.", "OB": "When I use the Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...), the search for entries from previous searches is case-insensitive. This means that if I type something in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it automatically searches for a matching entry in the history and replaces what I typed with the value from the history. Additionally, the case of what I typed may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace dialog should not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history. It should only suggest matching entries from the history, but leave the typed entry unchanged. The case sensitivity of the search should also be improved to accurately match the case of what is typed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the F1 build. \n2. Go to Edit > Find/Replace... \n3. In the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field, type a value that is not present in the search history. \n4. Click on 'Find' or 'Replace' button. \n5. Note that the typed entry is not replaced with any value from the history. \n6. Repeat steps 3-4 but this time type a value that is present in the search history. \n7. Observe that the typed entry is replaced with the matching value from the history."}
