{"id": "21834", "title": "Bug 21834 - Coolbar deleting items corrupts layout", "description": "In build 2002071610021, when pressing the Delete button, the first item on the second row is deleted. However, instead of the Launch item staying on the second row, it is moved to the first row. This results in the corrupting of the layout. The expected behavior is that when the delete occurs, the second row should remain with the Launch item staying on the second row.", "OB": "Press the Delete button. This will delete the first item on the second row. Notice that the Launch item is moved to the first row when the delete occurs. The Launch item should stay on the second row.", "EB": "Press the Delete button. This will delete the first item on the second row. Notice that the second row is removed when the delete occurs.
