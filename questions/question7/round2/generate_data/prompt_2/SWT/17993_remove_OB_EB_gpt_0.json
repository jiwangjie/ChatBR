{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "Currently, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. However, it would be better if the application doesn't replace what I type with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application automatically replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the application. 2. Choose Edit > Find/Replace... 3. In the 'Find' field, type 'a'. 4. Click 'Find'. 5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. Ensure that the application does not replace the typed entry with a value from the history."}
