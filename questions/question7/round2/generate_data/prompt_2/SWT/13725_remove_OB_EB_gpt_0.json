Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2. Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3. Perform the following steps:\n   a. Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n   b. Choose 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n   c. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n\nNote: The above steps should take approximately 8 seconds to complete. However, when selecting 'Revert' from the popup menu in the editor after replicating steps 1 and 2, it takes around 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file content."}
