{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the current behavior is to replace the typed entry with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers, but it may not be desirable in all cases. It is suggested to change the behavior to allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. In the meantime, it is recommended to remove this feature. ", "OB": "Currently, when I type in the Find or Replace With fields, the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history. This behavior limits the ability to perform find and replace operations, especially when the case needs to be preserved. ", "EB": "The behavior of Find/Replace should be modified so that the typed entry in the Find or Replace With fields is not replaced with a value from the history. This will allow for a more flexible range of find and replace operations, while still respecting the case of what the user types. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document to make the Edit > Find/Replace... option available. 2. Click on Edit > Find/Replace... to open the Find/Replace dialog. 3. In the Find field, type 'a' and click 'Find'. 4. Try to type 'A' in the Find field. Notice that it is not possible to enter a different case for the search term. "}
