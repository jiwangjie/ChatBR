We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the attached code in build 20020920 on Windows, the text widget does not lose focus when interacting with the Tree parent. This issue does not occur on Linux.", "EB": "When running the attached code in build 20020920, the text widget should lose focus when interacting with the Tree parent on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "1. Open the attached code in build 20020920.\n2. Interact with the Tree widget using various actions.\n3. Observe if the focus is properly transferred to the text widget."}
