This causes an issue in the CLDC version of SWT. The problem can be observed when using jxeLink or similar tools. The Eclipse compiler and Sun's compiler do not raise any compiler errors for this issue.", "EB": "The usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class on win32 should be changed to remove the reflection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code on win32 with the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Verify or use jxeLink or similar tools.\n3. Observe that a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown due to the usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe code should not throw a NoClassDefFoundError when using Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class on win32."}
