{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature is replacing what I type with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete but it is causing difficulties in performing find and replace operations. It would be better if the feature respected the case of what the user types and allowed the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. Until then, the feature should be removed to avoid confusion.", "OB": "When using the F1 build and accessing the Find/Replace dialog through Edit > Find/Replace..., the history of recent searches is displayed. Typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields triggers a search in the history. If a matching entry is found, what I have typed is replaced with the value from the history. The search in the history is case-insensitive, meaning that the case of what I have typed may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "The current behavior of Find/Replace, where it replaces the typed entry with a value from the history, should be changed. The feature should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. In the meantime, until this behavior is improved, I suggest removing the feature completely. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document so that Edit > Find/Replace... is accessible. \n2. Type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.\n3. Observe that the typed entry gets replaced with a value from the history, making it impossible to perform find or replace operations. \n\nThe same behavior applies to the 'Replace With' field."}
