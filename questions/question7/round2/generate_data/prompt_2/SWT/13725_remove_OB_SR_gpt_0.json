{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in Java editor", "description": "When using the Java editor, reverting the file contents is significantly slower than closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "Currently, when I try to revert the file contents in the Java editor, it takes much longer compared to just closing and reopening the file.", "EB": "This behavior is unexpected because reverting the file contents should not take more time than closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a Java file in the Java editor.\n2. Make some changes to the file.\n3. Try to revert the file contents using the appropriate option.\n4. Note the time it takes for the file to be reverted.\n5. Close the file.\n6. Reopen the file.\n7. Note the time it takes for the file to be reopened.\nCompare the time taken in step 4 and step 7 to observe the significant difference in speed."}
