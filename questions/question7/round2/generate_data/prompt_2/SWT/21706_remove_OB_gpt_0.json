This is necessary because there are no nonstatic methods in this class. Additionally, making the constructor private does not increase the size of the class.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), 'windowProc', 4). Though it has not been tested, it is expected to perform the same function."}
