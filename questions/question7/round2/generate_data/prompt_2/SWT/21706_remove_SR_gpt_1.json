This line throws a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC class libraries, causing a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. This problem is only visible if jxeLink or a similar tool is used. The Eclipse compiler and Sun's compiler do not produce any compiler errors related to this issue.", "EB": "To address this problem, a private constructor should be added to BidiUtil. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, making the constructor private is a good practice. This change does not add any size because the compiler automatically generates a public constructor.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 version. 2. Look for the line that initializes the static Callback object using Class.forName()."}
