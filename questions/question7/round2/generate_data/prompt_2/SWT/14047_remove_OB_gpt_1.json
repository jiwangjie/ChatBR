This leads to performance degradation and unnecessary rendering. The issue can be reproduced by running the provided test case.", "OB": "When changing the text in StyledText with word wrap, the redraw process is inefficient, resulting in multiple redraws for each visible line.", "EB": "The redraw process should be optimized so that there is at most one redraw for each visible line during text change with word wrap in StyledText.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, add the following line to the performPaint method in StyledText class:\nSystem.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);"}
