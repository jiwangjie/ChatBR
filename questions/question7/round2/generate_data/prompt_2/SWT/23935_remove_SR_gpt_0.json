{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. This behavior causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When running the attached code using build 20020920, the left tree and text should behave as they do on Windows and Linux, losing focus correctly when clicking on the tree.", "SR": ""}
