Integration build 09/17. The text fields in the Project Properties Info page look bad on all motif platforms. On motif platforms, these text fields have automatic borders, which make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which make them stand out worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders and on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, they have different colored backgrounds.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Select a Project. \n2. Right-click and select Properties. \n3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (e.g., values for Path, Type, etc.)."}
