This is causing the page to look bad on all motif platforms. It is expected that the fields are created as readonly labels instead of text fields. It is assumed that their values should be selectable and copyable by the user. This issue is observed in the integration build dated 09/17.", "OB": "On the Project Properties Info page, the fields for Path, Type, etc. are displayed as editable text fields.", "EB": "On the Project Properties Info page, the fields for Path, Type, etc. should be displayed as readonly labels.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Select a Project. 2. Right-click on the project and select Properties. 3. On the subsequent Info page, observe that the fields for Path, Type, etc. are editable text fields instead of readonly labels."}
