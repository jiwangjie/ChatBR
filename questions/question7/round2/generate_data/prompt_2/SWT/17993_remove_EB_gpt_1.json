{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog currently replaces what is manually typed in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete functionality commonly found in browsers. However, it would be more preferable if the user's manual input is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. It may be beneficial to consider implementing a full autocomplete feature in the future.", "OB": "I am using the F1 build. In the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit->Find/Replace...), there is a history of recent searches. When I type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the system searches for entries from previous searches. If it finds a matching entry, it replaces my manually typed input with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, so the case of my typed input may be modified to match the value in the history. This behavior sometimes makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "The behavior should be such that what I manually type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. The system should only suggest or show the history as options, but not replace my input without my consent.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by choosing Edit->Find/Replace... 2. Notice the history of recent searches. 3. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field. 4. Click 'Find'. 5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. The system should not replace the manually typed input with a value from the history."}
