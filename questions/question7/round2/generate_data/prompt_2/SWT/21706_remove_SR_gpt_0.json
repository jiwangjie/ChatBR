This error is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This causes an issue in the CLDC version of SWT. This problem can only be observed if jxeLink or something similar is verified or used, as the compiler assumes that NoClassDefFoundError is available. As a result, there are no compiler errors from the eclipse compiler or Sun's compiler.", "EB": "To address this issue, it is suggested to add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, having a private constructor would prevent unnecessary instantiation. This change would not add any additional size because the compiler automatically generates a free public constructor. It only modifies the constructor's visibility from public to private.", "SR": ""}
