Looks bad on all motif platforms. ", "OB": "On Windows, the project properties info page appears fine. However, on motif platforms (such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX), the text fields in the info page display automatic borders, indicating them as user input targets. Furthermore, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these text fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The text fields in the project properties info page should be changed to readonly labels. This would prevent them from receiving user input. It appears that the current usage of text fields in this page is to allow users to select and copy the field values.", "SR": ""}
