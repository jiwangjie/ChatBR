{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace should not replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is common in browsers. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided. For me, it is very common to perform operations like this. I think the current behavior should be changed to something simpler that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "When using the Find/Replace feature, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document so that the Edit > Find/Replace... command becomes available.\n2. Type a value in the Find field.\n3. Observe that the typed entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history.\n4. This behavior can also be observed in the Replace With field."}
