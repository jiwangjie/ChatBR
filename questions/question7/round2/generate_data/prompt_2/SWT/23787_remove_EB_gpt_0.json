The current implementation of the Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog is not suitable for Motif platforms. On Motif platforms, these text fields have automatic borders, which makes them look like user input targets. Moreover, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "OB": "On Motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders and on Solaris/AIX/HPUX they have different colored backgrounds.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Select a Project.\n2. Right-click and select Properties.\n3. In the subsequent Info page, observe the fields that display values for Path, Type, etc. These fields should not appear as text fields, but instead, they should have a different visual representation to indicate that they are read-only."}
