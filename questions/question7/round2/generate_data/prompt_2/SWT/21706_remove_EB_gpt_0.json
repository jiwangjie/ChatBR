This usage of Class.forName(\"org...BidiUtil\") may cause a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This issue is only visible when using jxeLink or a similar tool, as the compiler automatically assumes that NoClassDefFoundError is available.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, the line above should be changed to: static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4). This change eliminates the use of reflection and should have the same effect as before.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, verify or use jxeLink with the existing code, and observe the NoClassDefFoundError. After making the suggested change, test the code again to ensure that the issue no longer occurs."}
