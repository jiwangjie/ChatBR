The Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog currently uses text fields, which is causing visual issues on motif platforms. On Windows, the page looks fine, but on motif platforms (such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX), the text fields have automatically applied borders that identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more.", "OB": "On motif platforms (Solaris, AIX, HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatically applied borders that indicate they are user input targets.
