{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when clicking on the tree, regardless of the operating system. The text widget should not be a child of the tree.", "SR": "1. Create a shell with a Tree widget and a Text widget as children.\n2. Click anywhere in the Tree widget.\n3. Check if the Tree widget gains focus.\n4. Click on the Tree widget again.\n5. Check if the Text widget loses focus.\n6. Verify that the Text widget is not a child of the Tree widget."}
