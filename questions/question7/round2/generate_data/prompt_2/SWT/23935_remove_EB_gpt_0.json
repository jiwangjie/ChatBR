{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This behavior causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree should gain focus, and the text widget should lose focus as expected. On Linux, the text widget should lose focus when you click on the tree like on Windows. The text widget should not be a child of the tree.", "SR": "1. Launch the application.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gains focus, but the text widget does not lose focus on Linux."}
