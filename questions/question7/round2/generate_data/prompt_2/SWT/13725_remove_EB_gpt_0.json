{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in Java editor", "description": "When performing the 'Revert' operation in the Java editor, it takes significantly longer compared to the 'Close' and 'Reopen' operations. This issue occurs when the user answers 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog and then double clicks on the file in the navigator to reopen it. The contents of the window take approximately 15 seconds to be replaced with the original contents. However, if the user repeats the steps of opening the file and marking it dirty, and then selects 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to perform the operation.", "OB": "Selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the Java editor after answering 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog and double clicking on the file in the navigator takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original contents.", "EB": "The 'Revert' operation should take a similar amount of time as the 'Close' and 'Reopen' operations, completing within a reasonable timeframe.", "SR": "1) Open the Java editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. 2) Select the end of the first line and press the space bar to mark the file as dirty. 3) Close the editor by clicking on the close box in the editor tab. 4) When prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, answer 'no'. 5) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. 6) Observe that it takes approximately 15 seconds for the contents of the window to be replaced with the original contents. 7) Repeat steps 1) and 2) to mark the file dirty again. 8) Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor. 9) Observe that it takes approximately 15 seconds to perform the 'Revert' operation."}
