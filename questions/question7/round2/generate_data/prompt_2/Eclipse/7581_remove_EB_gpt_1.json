{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com>:\n\nJoe reports that when using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects in a property sheet, the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item. However, the drop-down button may now be too far to the right and is clipped off, making it inaccessible to users without expanding the property sheet width.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly when any of the strings in the editor are wider than the property sheet column. The drop-down button may be clipped off and become inaccessible to users.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer with objects that have ComboBoxCellEditor.\n2. Ensure that at least one of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the property sheet column.\n3. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor grows to accommodate the widest item, but the drop-down button is clipped and becomes invisible.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe ComboBoxCellEditor should size correctly in the property sheet, ensuring that the drop-down button is always visible and accessible to users."}
