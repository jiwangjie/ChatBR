{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows me to edit objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor.\nI use the method in IPropertyDescriptor to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include the ComboBoxCellEditor, which can be given strings.\nThe editor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column.\nA problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\nIt seems that the combo box grows to the width of the largest item.\nThe problem is that the drop-down button may now be too far to the right and off the visible area of the property sheet, so it is clipped.\nFrom a user experience perspective, they can no longer see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The combo box does not size correctly in the property sheet.\nThe combo box grows to the width of the largest item, causing the drop-down button to be off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped.\nAs a result, users cannot see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column.\nIn this case, the drop-down button should be visible within the property sheet.", "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object with a property sheet containing ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n3. Ensure that one of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box grows to fit the width of the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped.\nExpected Behavior:\nThe combo box should always be the width of the property sheet column.\nThe drop-down button should be visible within the property sheet without the need to resize the view."}
