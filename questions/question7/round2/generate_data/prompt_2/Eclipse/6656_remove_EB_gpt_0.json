{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the close button and pulldown menu icon move below the label. This behavior is observed on Linux, running build 20011127, but does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000. The close button and pulldown menu icon should not move down when the view is resized smaller to avoid confusing the users.", "OB": "On Linux, running build 20011127, when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down.", "EB": "On Linux, running build 20011127, when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items should stay aligned with the label.
