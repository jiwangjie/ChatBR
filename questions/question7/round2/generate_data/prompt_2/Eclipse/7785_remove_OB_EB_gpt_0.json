{"id": "7785", "title": "Bug 7785 - SaveAs Forgets the file type", "description": "The SaveAs function is forgetting the file type and displaying a generic file icon instead of the parent Java file icon.", "OB": "When I open an existing Java file and modify it (for example, by moving a class) and then click the SaveAs icon next to the Save Icon, a dialog box appears. I browse for a valid container location and type the filename but ignore the extension as it is not requested. After clicking Ok, I observe that the Navigator has added the file in the specified location but without displaying the file extension.", "EB": "When I perform the SaveAs operation, the file should retain its file type and the icon should be consistent with the parent Java file icon.", "SR": "1) Open an existing Java file\n2) Make modifications to the file\n3) Click the SaveAs icon next to the Save Icon\n4) In the dialog box, browse for a valid container location\n5) Enter the filename without the file extension\n6) Click Ok"}
