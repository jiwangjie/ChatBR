{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects with a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns, and each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor, I create cell editors using the method provided by IPropertyDescriptor. I use this method to create editors that include the ComboBoxCellEditor, which can be given a list of strings. The editors appear in column two of the property sheet and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column. If any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the widest item. The problem with this is that the drop-down button may now be too far to the right and go off the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped. As a result, users cannot see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size itself correctly in the property sheet so that the drop-down button is always visible within the visible area of the column, even when there are wider strings.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Create a PropertySheetViewer that allows editing of objects.\n2. Add rows to the viewer with name-value pairs.\n3. Define an IPropertyDescriptor for each column and use the createCellEditor method to create a ComboBoxCellEditor for column two, providing it with a list of strings.\n4. Ensure that one of the strings in the list is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Open the property sheet and observe that the combo box grows to the width of the widest string, causing the drop-down button to be clipped if it goes beyond the visible area of the property sheet.\n6. Try to view the drop-down button by making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area."}
