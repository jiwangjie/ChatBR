There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The UI should have options for Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be available to all plugins to ensure consistent line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use a Unix and Windows workstation to develop a Unix product/program. Create a new file using Eclipse on Windows and observe that it does not have Unix line delimiters."}
