The workbench should display a warning message stating that opening the file may overwrite changes and asking if the user wants to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, indicating that the user should close all open files first. We believe this behavior is a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Close any open files in the workbench. 2. Go to the Java Perspective. 3. Double-click on a Java file to open it. 4. Right-click on the same Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. Expected behavior: A warning message should be displayed, informing the user that opening the file may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, indicating that all open files must be closed before opening the file in another editor."}
