", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not resize correctly in the property sheet. Specifically, the width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would expect the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Similar to the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this issue is caused by us or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet. \n2. Edit a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor. \n3. Observe that the width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column."}
