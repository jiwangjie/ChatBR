{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120MRU File List is not persisted between sessions (1GE71Z0)", "description": "The bug report describes an issue where the MRU (Most Recently Used) file list is not being persisted between sessions. The File menu's MRU list should retain the previously accessed files even after the application is closed and reopened. The note mentions that the implementation should not directly access the underlying resource and that the IEditorInput may not necessarily be a resource.", "OB": "The MRU file list is not persisted between sessions. When files are accessed and appear in the File menu's MRU list during one session, they no longer appear in the MRU list when the application is reopened for a new session.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Launch the application.\n2. Access some files and verify that they appear in the MRU list in the File menu.\n3. Close the application.\n4. Reopen the application and check if the previously accessed files still remain in the MRU list of the File menu."}
