When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, users will get confused.", "OB": "The close button moves down when the view is resized smaller.", "EB": "The close button should stay in its original position when the view is resized smaller.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n3. Observe the position of the close button as the view is being resized."}
