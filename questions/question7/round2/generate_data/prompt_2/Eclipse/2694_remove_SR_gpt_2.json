Currently, multiple selection is not enabled. The default entry in the associated editors list is not marked as '(default)' like in other perspectives. Some suggestions for improvement:\n- Enable multiple selection.\n- Mark the default entry in the associated editors list as '(default)'.\n\nAdditionally, the dialog lacks a width hint. When the File editors Preference page is selected, it grows in height whereas other pages do not. Fixes have been made for items a, c, and f. Release is needed.", "OB": "When no selection is made, the 'OK' button is still enabled.", "EB": "When 'Add' is clicked, it should not add a hidden entry. Entries that already exist in the associated editors should not be available for selection.", "SR": ""}
