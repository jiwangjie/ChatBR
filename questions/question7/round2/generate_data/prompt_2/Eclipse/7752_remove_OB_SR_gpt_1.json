{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752: Export multiple files with the same filename under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Export multiple files with the same filename under different directories to a zip file. Example: a. Project 1: has a file named 'foo.txt' in directory 'dir1'. b. Project 2: also has a file named 'foo.txt' in directory 'dir2'. 2. Observe the behavior of the zip file.", "OB": "When exporting the files to a zip file, only one file with the same name is included. In this example, only 'foo.txt' from project 1 (dir1) is included in the zip file, while the file 'foo.txt' from project 2 (dir2) is excluded.", "EB": "The zip file should include both files with the same name ('foo.txt') from different directories ('dir1' and 'dir2').", "SR": "1. Create two projects, each with a file named 'foo.txt' located in different directories. 2. Export the files to a zip file. 3. Verify that both files are included in the zip file under their respective directories. "}
