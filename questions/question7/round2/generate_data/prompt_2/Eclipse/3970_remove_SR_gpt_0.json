{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Bug 3970 - The Windows workstations used as X terminals and to run Eclipse do not always have the desired line delimiters for new files. Currently, the line delimiter for new files is determined based on the system properties. However, this does not always align with user preferences. An option is needed in the UI Preferences to define the line delimiter for new files. This is important because the end product is a Unix product, therefore new files should have Unix line delimiters even if they are created on Windows. The UI should be provided by the Workbench so that all plugins can use the same line delimiter for new files.", "OB": "When creating a new file, the line delimiter used is determined by System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\").", "EB": "When creating a new file, there should be an option in the UI Preferences to define the line delimiter. The default line delimiter should be Unix, regardless of the platform used. Possible values for the line delimiter should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Go to the Preferences menu.\n3. Look for the option to define the line delimiter for new files.\n4. Check that the default line delimiter is set to Unix.\n5. Create a new file.\n6. Check that the line delimiter for the new file is Unix, regardless of the platform used."}
