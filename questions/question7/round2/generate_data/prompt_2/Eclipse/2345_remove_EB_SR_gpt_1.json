Create a new basic project\n2. Create a new file named test.xml\n3. The default editor used for test.xml is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content\n4. In the Navigator, select test.xml\n5. Choose 'Open With...' option\n6. Select 'Default Text Editor'\n\nThe expected behavior is that a new editor should open for the file, since the editor type is different\n\nHowever, the observed behavior is that nothing happens when I select 'Default Text Editor'. Instead, it reactivates the scripted resource editor example\n\nAdditionally, when searching for an existing open file, the search should also consider the editor types", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
