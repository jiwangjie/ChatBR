", "OB": "When using ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet, the combo box does not size correctly. It does not match the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the same width as the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this problem is caused by our software or SWT library.", "SR": "1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Select a cell that uses ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column."}
