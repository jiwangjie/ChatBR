When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "OB": "When the Navigator view is resized smaller on Linux with build 20011127, the close button and pulldown menu icon move below the label.", "EB": "In previous builds (e.g., 20011116 on Nt2000), the close button and pulldown menu icon used to stay on the same line as the label no matter how small the view got. This should be the expected behavior. Having the close button and pulldown menu icon moving down can cause usability problems because users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view in the application.\n2. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n3. Observe that the close button and pulldown menu icon move below the label as the view gets smaller."}
