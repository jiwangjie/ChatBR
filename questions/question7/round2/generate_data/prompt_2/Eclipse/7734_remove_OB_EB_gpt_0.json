{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: No savefile warnings when shutting down the system", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "When a session on the WSWB (Web Standard Workbench) is open and there are unsaved changes in any opened .txt file, shutting down Windows without saving the changes will result in the loss of the unsaved changes. Steps to reproduce: 1. Start the WSWB and create a new project. 2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. 3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. 4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shut down or restart the computer. Results: There is no warning or prompt to give users an opportunity to save their changes before shutting down the computer. The computer is shut down or restarted immediately. Other Windows programs (such as Word, Outlook, etc.) provide warnings or prompts in similar situations."}
