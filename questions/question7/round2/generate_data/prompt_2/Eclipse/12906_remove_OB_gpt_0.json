There should be a warning/error message displayed.", "OB": "Currently, when trying to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor, nothing happens. No warning/error message is displayed.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning/error message displayed when attempting to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad/WordPad window will open with the Java file.\n3. Close the Notepad/WordPad window.\n4. Go back to the Java Perspective and double-click on the Java file to open it in the workbench.\n5. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe workbench should display a warning message stating that you may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue, or an error message stating that you should close all files first.\n\nWe believe that this is a safety feature where the IDE doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in the IDE."}
