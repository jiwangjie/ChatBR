Open the scripted resource editor example.\n2. Create a new basic project.\n3. Create a new file test.xml.\n4. The scripted resource editor example is used as the default editor for XML files, so it opens for test.xml.\n5. In the Navigator, select test.xml.\n6. Right-click and choose 'Open With...' / Default Text Editor.\n7. The editor does not change, the scripted resource editor example remains active.\n\nExpected:\n- The Default Text Editor should open for test.xml, replacing the scripted resource editor example.\n\nNOTES: Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types."}
