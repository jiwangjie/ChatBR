Select both projects previously created.\n3. Provide a name for the zip file (e.g. test.zip).\n4. Start exporting to the zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nWhen exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, an error message box pops up. The error message states that there were problems encountered during export, and the detail refers to the file with the same name in project 2 as the problem (e.g. foo.txt in project 2).\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the \"Export\" dialog window.\n2. Select both projects previously created.\n3. Rename the file 'foo.txt' in project 2 to 'foo2.txt'.\n4. Provide a name for the zip file (e.g. test.zip).\n5. Start exporting to the zip file."}
