Create a new basic project\n2. Create a new file named test.xml\n3. The scripted resource editor example is the default editor for XML files\n4. Open Navigator and select test.xml\n5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...'\n6. Select 'Default Text Editor'\n\nThe expected behavior is that a new editor should open for the file test.xml because the selected editor type is different. However, nothing happens and the scripted resource editor example remains active.\n\nNOTES:", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
