The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When using the SaveAs function, the file is saved with a generic file icon and no file extension shown in the Navigator panel.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original java file, unless explicitly changed during the SaveAs process. The file icon in the Navigator panel should also remain as the java file icon.", "SR": "1) Open an existing java file. \n2) Make a modification to the file (e.g. move an existing class).\n3) Click on the SaveAs icon located next to the Save Icon. A dialog box will appear.\n4) Browse for a valid container location.\n5) Type the filename without including the file extension, as it is not requested.\n6) Click Ok. \n\nExpected result: The file is saved with the same extension as the original file in the specified location. The java file icon is retained in the Navigator panel."}
