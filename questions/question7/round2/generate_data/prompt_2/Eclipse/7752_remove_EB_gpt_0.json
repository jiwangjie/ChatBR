{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752: Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Launch WSWB and create two projects. 2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt'). 3. From the main menu, select 'File' -> 'Export' and choose 'Zip File' to export. 4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects and give the zip file a name (e.g., 'test.zip'). 5. Begin the export to zip file.", "OB": "When exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file using WSWB, an error occurs. In the 'Export' dialog window, after selecting both projects and providing a zip file name, the export process fails. A popup message box appears with the error message stating that problems were encountered during export. The details provided in the error message indicate that the file with the same name in project2 is causing the problem.", "EB": "The export process should successfully generate a zip file containing all the selected projects with their respective files, even if there are multiple files with the same name under different directories.", "SR": "1.
