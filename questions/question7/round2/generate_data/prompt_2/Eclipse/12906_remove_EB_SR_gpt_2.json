There should be a warning message displayed in the workbench stating that opening the file in another editor may overwrite changes and asking if the user wants to continue. Alternatively, there should be an error message indicating that all files must be closed first before opening the file in another editor. We believe this behavior is intended for safety, as WSAD does not allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "When attempting to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor, a warning message should be displayed in the workbench.
