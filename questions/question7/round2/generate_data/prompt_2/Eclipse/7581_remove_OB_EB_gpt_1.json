{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in Property Sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, the property sheet displays a set of rows that contain name-value pairs in two columns. The columns are defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the IPropertyDescriptor's method to create a cell editor, specifically a ComboBoxCellEditor, with a constructor that accepts strings. The ComboBoxCellEditor is displayed in the second column of the property sheet. If any of the strings in the combo box are wider than the width of the column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item. However, the drop down button of the combo box is not resized accordingly and may be clipped if it extends beyond the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should resize properly in the PropertySheetViewer. When a string in the combo box is wider than the column, the combo box should expand to fit the widest item, and the drop down button should adjust its position to remain within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer in an application. \n2. Create a row with a name-value pair that has a string wider than the column width. \n3. Notice that the combo box expands to fit the widest item, but the drop down button is off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped. \n4. Adjust the property sheet view width until the drop down button is within the visible area."}
