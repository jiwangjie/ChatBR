The text moves in an unexpected way. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the given scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should also be shifted left until the space character (i.e., getting rid of the tab). However, if there is a stray space, the behavior is confusing as the text does not shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
