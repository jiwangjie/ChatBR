{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "After pressing Ok, the following error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem arises from the fact that setting the output location and classpath are treated as separate operations. Setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties and modify the settings to use the project itself as the source folder and the output location."}
