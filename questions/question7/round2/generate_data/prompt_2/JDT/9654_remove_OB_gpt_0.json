Duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\n2. The first and second column could be merged.\n\n", "OB": "The marking between the button and the list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table does not have a label, preventing it from containing a mnemonic. Multiple selection is not allowed, although the move up/down function can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview is not a label that wraps. The signature preview does not have the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "EB": "The marking between the button and the list should be reduced. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed, as the move up/down function can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, change a parameter name to something very long and observe that the preview is cut off."}
