{"id": "4964", "title": "Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type the '(', the automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected. It ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While typing 'button.dispose' and then typing '(', the automatic code assist inserts 'button.DISPOSED'.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should insert 'button.dispose()' when I type 'button.dispose('.", "SR": "1.
