{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message. The New Java Package wizard displays a message at the top saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' when the package name field is empty. This message is confusing and it is unclear why it is shown. The issue also mentions that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. It is suggested to either remove the message or provide a clearer explanation for its purpose. Additionally, there is a question about how to create a default package as it seems to always be present and cannot be created by the user.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and having an empty package name field, a message saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top.", "EB": "The message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should either be removed or clarified to provide a better understanding of its purpose.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new Java Project.\n2. Select the project.\n3. Open the New Java Package wizard without entering a package name."}
