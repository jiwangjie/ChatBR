I have to delete it all and start again. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' better than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, if I type 'button.' and then select 'DISPOSED' from the list, it inserts 'button.DISPOSED' instead of 'button.dispose()'.", "EB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, if I type 'button.' and then select 'DISPOSED' from the list, it should insert 'button.dispose()' instead of 'button.DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor. 2. Type 'button.' 3. Invoke the code assist feature. 4. Select 'DISPOSED' from the list. 5. Observe that 'button.DISPOSED' is inserted instead of 'button.dispose()'. "}
