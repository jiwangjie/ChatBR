{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 - ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473 describes an issue with the ShiftLeft behavior when tabs and spaces are intermixed. This bug was observed in Build 200110251.", "OB": "In the first line of the text, there is a tab character followed by spaces. When ShiftLeft is executed, the text does not shift properly. It is not clear how the behavior is specified, but in this scenario, what should happen is that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., replacing the tab with spaces). Having a stray space in the text makes it confusing as it prevents the shift from occurring as expected.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
