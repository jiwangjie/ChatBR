{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files and can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, the system should confirm that all files in the output directory, including non-.class files, will be deleted and the directory can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Select an existing directory structure to create the project in.\n3. Choose a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Verify that a confirmation message appears, stating that the chosen bin directory will be emptied and rebuilt.\n5. Proceed with creating the project and observe that the bin directory is deleted and rebuilt from the .java files if necessary."}
