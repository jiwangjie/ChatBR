However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works as expected.", "OB": "The Search dialog in the package view initializes with the fully qualified name of the element. However, when searching for declarations, this fully qualified name is not found. Instead, the search should first try to get the Java element and if that fails, it should display the element name and not the fully qualified name.", "EB": "When searching for declarations using the Package view selection and dialog, the expected behavior is to return the correct results based on the element's name or fully qualified name.", "SR": "1. Open the Package view.\n2. Select an element in the package.\n3. Right-click on the selected element.\n4. From the context menu, choose 'Search' option.\n5. In the Search dialog, ensure that the search term is pre-populated with the fully qualified name of the selected element.\n6. Click on the 'Search' button.\n7. Verify that the search returns the correct results based on the element's name or fully qualified name."}
