The tab character in the first line should be replaced with spaces to match the indentation of the second line. If there is a stray space in the first line, it should be removed. The ShiftLeft command should shift both lines to the left.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document with two lines of text, where the first line contains a tab character and the second line contains spaces. 2. Execute the ShiftLeft command. 3. Verify that the text does not move as expected, with the first line not matching the indentation of the second line and any stray spaces causing confusion."}
