{"id": "7330", "title": "Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal preference, which is not clear to users. Some actions are available in the context menu while others are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views in order to access certain actions. This should be changed.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu or the global menu when I select text in the editor. I had to switch to the Outline view to find the action.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available either in the context menu or the global menu when I select text. It should be easily accessible from the editor without having to switch views.", "SR": "1. Open the editor. 2. Select some text. 3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu. 4. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the menu. 5. If not, switch to the Outline view and check if the action is available in the global menu."}
