{"id": "5473", "title": "ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251. ", "OB": "When the tab character is used in the first line and spaces are used in the second line for indentation, executing ShiftLeft does not properly shift the lines. The text does not move at all. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in this case, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character, removing the tab character. The presence of a stray space makes it difficult to understand why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft should correctly shift the lines. The second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character, removing the tab character. The presence of a stray space should not affect the behavior. The text should move as expected when ShiftLeft is executed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same. \n2. Select both lines. \n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command. \n4. Verify that the text does not move properly, and the indentation is not adjusted according to expectations."}
