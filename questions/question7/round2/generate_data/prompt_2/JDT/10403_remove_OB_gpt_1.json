{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a project and sets the output folder to a bin directory, the system does not check if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "After creating a project and setting the output folder to a bin directory, the system should confirm if the bin directory can be scrubbed (deleted) and then rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the project creation interface.\n2. Specify an existing directory structure for the project.\n3. Set the output folder to a bin directory.\n4. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n5. Observe that there is no confirmation or check to verify if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
