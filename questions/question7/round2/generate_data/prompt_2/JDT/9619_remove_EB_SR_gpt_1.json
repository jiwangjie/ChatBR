Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the superclass), so it could be done. \nAt least isValidTypeName function should be implemented.\nThe label should say 'Select destination type'.\n\nBrowse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes).\nTitle is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\nOnly types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\nDestination type can be the same as the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "1.
