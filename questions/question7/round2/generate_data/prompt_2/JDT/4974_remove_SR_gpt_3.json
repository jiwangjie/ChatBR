This suggests that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. However, setting the output location first creates an illegal state, causing this error.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation. The setting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation, similar to how the validation checks the classpath and output location at once. It is also worth noting that the error message seems incorrect and should instead state: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
