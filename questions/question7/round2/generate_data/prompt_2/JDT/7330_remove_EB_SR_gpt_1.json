{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis which is not clear to users. This should be changed so that all actions are reachable from the editor, either in the context menu or in some other global menu. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu or in some other global menu within the editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a piece of text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not listed in the context menu."}
