{"id": "4329", "title": "Bug 4329: No results when searching via Package view selection and dialog", "description": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are found. The package view initializes the Search dialog with the fully qualified name, which is not found when searching for declarations. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly. The expected behavior is that Java search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name. NOTES:", "OB": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are found.", "EB": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog, the expected behavior is to display results for the searched item.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Open the Package view. \n2. Select a package. \n3. Click on the search button or use the search shortcut. \n4. Enter a search term and press Enter. \n5. Observe that no search results are displayed."}
