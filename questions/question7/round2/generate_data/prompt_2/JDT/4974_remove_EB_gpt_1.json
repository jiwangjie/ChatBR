{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "After pressing OK, the following error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. By setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the project and select 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project itself as the source folder and the project itself as the output location."}
