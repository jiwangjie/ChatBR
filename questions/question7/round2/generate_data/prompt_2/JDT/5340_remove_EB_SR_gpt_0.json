Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. The expected behavior is that either the cancellation request is honored, or the cancel button is disabled. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter.", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately.", "EB": "The progress dialog should remain open until the process of adding an exception breakpoint is complete.

When the dialog appears, click on the cancel button.\n3. Observe that the progress dialog immediately closes, and the exception list comes up.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n1. Modify the call to ProgressMonitorDialog.run and pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter.\n2. Test adding an exception breakpoint and verify that the progress dialog remains open until the process is complete.
