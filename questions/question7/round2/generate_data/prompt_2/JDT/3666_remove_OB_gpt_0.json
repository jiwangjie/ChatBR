This behavior can be observed when adding a parameter to the 'baz' method call in the 'bar' method. Currently, the code is replaced up until the end of the current identifier. The desired behavior is to replace the code until the cursor location where the code assist was triggered.\n\nThe code should be changed to:\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Change the 'baz' call to 'baz(x.x.foo())'.\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'.\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist.\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list.\n5. Select 'foo()'.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe code replacement should be limited to 'baz(x.x.foo())' when using code assist.", "OB": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature is replacing code up until the end of the current identifier instead of the cursor location where code assist was triggered when adding a parameter to the 'baz' method call.", "EB": "The code is changed to 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())'.
