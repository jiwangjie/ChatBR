{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Setting classpath and output location should be one operation", "description": "When trying to set the output location and classpath for a project, two separate operations are required. However, this causes an issue where an illegal state is created, resulting in an error message.", "OB": "After pressing 'Ok' in the project properties, an error message appears: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This occurs because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations, and by setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "The setting for classpath and output location should be combined into one operation to avoid the creation of an illegal state and the resulting error message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Go to the project properties and change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
