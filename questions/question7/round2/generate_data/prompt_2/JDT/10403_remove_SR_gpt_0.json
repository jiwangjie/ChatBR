{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project and sets the output folder to an existing bin directory, the bin directory is not scrubbed.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project and sets the output folder to an existing bin directory, the bin directory should be scrubbed, i.e., deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the project creation dialogue.\n2. Choose an existing bin directory as the output folder.\n3. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n4. Verify that the bin directory is not deleted and rebuilt."}
