{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel adding an exception breakpoint, the cancelation request is ignored and the progress dialog closes immediately. This behavior should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. When calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancelable parameter.", "OB": "The progress dialog closes immediately.", "EB": "The progress dialog should honor the cancellation request and either stop adding the exception breakpoint or disable the cancel button.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the J! button to add an exception. 3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
