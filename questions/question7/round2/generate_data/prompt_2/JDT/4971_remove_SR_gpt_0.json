{"id": "4971", "title": "Strange behavior when using 'copy package'", "description": "When using the 'copy package' functionality in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui, the package 'ui' is not properly copied. Instead of being copied as 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui', it is just copied as 'ui'.", "OB": "As a result, the destination package 'xx' contains a package named 'ui'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the destination package 'xx' should contain a package named 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the 'copy package' functionality in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.\n2. Select the package named 'xxx' as the destination package."}
