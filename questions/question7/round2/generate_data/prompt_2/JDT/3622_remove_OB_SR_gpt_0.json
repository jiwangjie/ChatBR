This message is confusing and needs clarification. There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Additionally, it is not clear how to create a default package since it always exists and cannot be created by the user.", "OB": "When invoking New Java Package, the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top, even though the package name field is empty.", "EB": "The confusing message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should not be displayed when the package name field is empty.

Observe that the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should not appear.\n4. Verify that the 'Finish' button is disabled."}
