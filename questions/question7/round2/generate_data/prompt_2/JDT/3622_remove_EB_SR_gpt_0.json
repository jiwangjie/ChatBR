{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "The New Package Wizard in the IDE displays a confusing message when invoked. The message states 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even though the package name field is empty. This is causing confusion for users who do not understand the meaning of the message. The bug report suggests that this message should be treated as an error and be displayed in red with an error icon, but the developer commented that it is only a warning. Furthermore, the bug report also mentions an issue with creating a default package. Currently, the user cannot create a default package as it is always present in the wizard. ", "OB": "When the New Package Wizard is invoked and the package name field is empty, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "When the New Package Wizard is invoked and the package name field is empty, no message related to the existence of a package should be displayed.", "SR": "1. Open the IDE. \n2. Click on 'New' to open the 'New Package' Wizard. \n3. Leave the package name field blank. \n4. Observe if any message related to the existence of a package is displayed at the top."}
