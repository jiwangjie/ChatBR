{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Even when the progress dialog closes, the exception list still comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. The expected behavior is for the cancellation request to be honored. Alternatively, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the cancelable parameter should be set to false in order to disable the cancel button.", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately.
