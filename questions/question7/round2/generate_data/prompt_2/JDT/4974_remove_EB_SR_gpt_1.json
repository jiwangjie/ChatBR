{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Setting classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When attempting to set the output location and classpath in one operation, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, which leads to an illegal state.", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok', an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "No error message should be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Navigate to the settings page for setting the classpath and output location. 2. Set the classpath and output location in one operation. 3. Click 'Ok' to apply the changes."}
