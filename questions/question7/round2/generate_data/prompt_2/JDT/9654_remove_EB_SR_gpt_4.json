The buttons are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\nd. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.\n\nTo fix this, the following changes are recommended:\n\ni. Perform duplicated name validation on the first page of the dialog.\n\nii. Merge the first and second columns in the dialog.", "OB": "a. Buttons in the 'Modify Parameters' dialog are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected.
