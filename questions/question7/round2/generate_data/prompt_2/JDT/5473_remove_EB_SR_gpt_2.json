", "OB": "When the tab character is replaced with spaces in the first line so that both lines are indented the same visually, and 'ShiftLeft' is executed, the second line moves. However, it is unclear how this behavior is specified. In the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least to the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). In any case, it is confusing when there is a stray space because it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
