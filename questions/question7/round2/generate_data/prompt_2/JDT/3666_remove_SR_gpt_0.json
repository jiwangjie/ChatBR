Consider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the baz call in bar to make the program correct.\n\nSteps:\n1. Open the code editor.\n2. Navigate to the bar method in class X.\n3. Add a parameter to the baz call.\n\nThe current behavior is that the code is changed to:\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nThe expected behavior is that it should change to:\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\npublic class X \n{\n    void bar(X x) \n    {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n\n    int foo() \n    {\n        return 5;\n    }\n\n    void baz(int i, int j) \n    {\n    }\n}\n\nKUM (5/21/01 9:02:11 AM)\n\nThe text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure. Moved to ITPJCORE.\n\nPM (9/4/2001 2:58:56 PM)\nOption was added.\n\nPM (9/25/2001 2:20:50 PM)\nRemoving option.\n\nThe choice amongst one or the other text replacement should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).
