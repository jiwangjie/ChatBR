{"id": "4971", "title": "Strange 'copy package' behavior", "description": "When performing the 'copy package' operation in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui in jdt.ui, the resulting package in the destination does not match the selected package.", "OB": "After copying a package, the destination project contains a package named 'ui' instead of the selected package.", "EB": "The copied package should have the same name and structure as the selected package.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Create a new project. 2. In the Package Explorer view, select a package to copy. For example, right-click on a package and choose Copy from the context menu. 3. Paste the copied package into another project or location."}
