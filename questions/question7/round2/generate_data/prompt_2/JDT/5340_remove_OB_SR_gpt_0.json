Eventually, the exception list appears and it ignores the cancellation request. The expected behavior is that either the cancellation request should be honored, or the cancel button should be disabled when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run and passing false for the cancellable parameter.", "OB": "When attempting to cancel add exception breakpoint process, clicking on cancel button has no effect.", "EB": "The progress dialog should not close immediately when canceling the add exception breakpoint process.
