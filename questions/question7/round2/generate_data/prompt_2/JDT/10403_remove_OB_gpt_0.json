Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the IDE \n2. Create a new project \n3. Select an existing directory structure for the project \n4. Set the output directory to a bin directory that contains extra files \n5. Confirm that a message is displayed, asking if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt. "}
