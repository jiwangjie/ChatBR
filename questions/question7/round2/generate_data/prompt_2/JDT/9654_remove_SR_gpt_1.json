The first and second column could be merged.", "OB": "a. The buttons are too small. b. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected, but both move buttons are enabled. c. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off. d. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The marking between the button and the list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. b. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. c. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied to more than one item. d. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": ""}
