", "OB": "When there is a mix of tabs and spaces in two lines of text, and the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing the ShiftLeft command does not shift the text as expected.\nThe behavior can be confusing because it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually indent both lines equally, executing the ShiftLeft command should shift the first line at least up to the space character, and the second line should also be shifted left.\nThe behavior should be specified so that it is clear how the ShiftLeft command should handle intermixed tabs and spaces.\nHaving a stray space that prevents the text from shifting is also confusing.", "SR": ""}
