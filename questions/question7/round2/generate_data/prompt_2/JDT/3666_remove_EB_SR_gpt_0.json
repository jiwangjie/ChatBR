This is causing issues for programmers as they are required to add a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method to make the program correct. The steps to reproduce this issue are as follows:\n\n1. Open the enclosed class\n2. Navigate to the 'bar' method\n3. Attempt to add a parameter to the 'baz' call by using code completion\n4. Observe that code assist is replacing more code that expected\n\nDue to this issue, the code is changed to 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())'. However, the expected behavior is that the code completion should provide 'baz(x.foo())' as the replacement.\n", "OB": "The code is changed to:\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code completion should provide 'baz(x.foo())' as the replacement.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n\n1.
