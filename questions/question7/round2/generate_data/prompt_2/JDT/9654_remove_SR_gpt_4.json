The buttons are too small.\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\ng. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The margin between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\nc. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\nd. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up/down can be applied to more than one item.\nf. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as when hovered.\nh. ", "SR": ""}
