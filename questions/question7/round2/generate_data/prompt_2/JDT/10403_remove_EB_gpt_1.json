{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation confirmation for scrubbing the bin directory", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files. This confirmation will help prevent accidental deletion or loss of important files.", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a project in an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or warning message about deleting and rebuilding the output directory.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation or warning message that asks if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This message will help prevent accidental deletion or loss of important files.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Select an existing directory structure as the project location.\n3. Ensure the output folder is set to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n4. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n\nExpected result: A confirmation or warning message should appear, asking if the user wants to delete and rebuild the output directory.\n\nActual result: Currently, no confirmation or warning message is displayed."}
