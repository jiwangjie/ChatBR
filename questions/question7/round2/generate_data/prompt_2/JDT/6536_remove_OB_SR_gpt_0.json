{"id": "6536", "title": "Bug 6536 - Add Javadoc on field in TH does nothing", "description": "When trying to add Javadoc on a field in TH, nothing happens. It is expected that selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option from the field's context menu should add Javadoc to the field. However, currently, this action does not have any effect. It is suggested that either the 'Add Javadoc' option should be removed from the menu, or preferably, selecting this option should actually add Javadoc to the field.", "OB": "When selecting 'Add Javadoc' from the context menu of a field in TH, no Javadoc is added to the field.", "EB": "Selecting 'Add Javadoc' from the context menu of a field in TH should add Javadoc to the field.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open TH\n2. Right-click on a field\n3. Select 'Add Javadoc' from the context menu\n4. Observe that no Javadoc is added to the field"}
