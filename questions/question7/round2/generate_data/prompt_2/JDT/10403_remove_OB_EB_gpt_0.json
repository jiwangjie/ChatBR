{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation fails when output directory cannot be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files. This is causing an issue as the directory cannot be scrubbed and the project creation fails.", "OB": "Project creation fails when the output directory cannot be deleted and rebuilt. Currently, no confirmation or error message is displayed to alert the user.", "EB": "When a user creates a project, a confirmation or error message should be displayed if the output directory cannot be scrubbed. This should alert the user that the project creation has failed and prompt them to select a different output directory.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Go to the project creation section.\n3. Choose an existing directory structure as the project location.\n4. Set the output directory to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n5. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n6. Verify that a confirmation or error message is displayed if the output directory cannot be scrubbed."}
