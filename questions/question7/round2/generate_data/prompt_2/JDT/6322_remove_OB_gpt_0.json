{"id": "6322", "title": "All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "When using JDK 1.4, the All types dialog displays obfuscated classes (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd'). This makes it difficult to find the relevant classes.", "OB": "The All types dialog shows obfuscated classes in the list.", "EB": "The obfuscated classes should be less prominent or excluded from the list.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the All types dialog.\n2. Observe the presence of obfuscated classes.\n\nSuggested solutions:\na) Sort lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter.\nb) Filter out the obfuscated classes completely.\n\nI suggest implementing solution a) as it would make it easier to identify the relevant classes."}
