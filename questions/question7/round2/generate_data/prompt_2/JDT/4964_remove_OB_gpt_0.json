{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'", "EB": "After typing 'button.dispose', the code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'", "SR": "1. Open Build 204\n2. Write SWT code and type 'button.dispose' without looking at the code assist list"}
