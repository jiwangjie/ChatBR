{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When trying to set the classpath and output location in the IDE, there is an error message displayed and an illegal state is created because setting these two properties are separate operations.", "OB": "When you press Ok, you get the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "To address this issue, the IDE should combine the setting of classpath and output location into one operation. Similar to the validation process, the setting of classpath and output location should be offered as a single action. Additionally, it appears that the error message displayed is not accurate. It should say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
