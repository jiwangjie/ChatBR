The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. Setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Setting classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location at once, the setting of classpath / output location should be made as a single operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
