The duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second columns could be merged.", "OB": "a. The buttons are too small.\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\nd. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The marking between the button and the list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog.\nb. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\nc. Multiple selection should be allowed, as the move up/down functionality can be applied on more than one item.\nd. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.\ne. The signature preview must have a label that warps."}
