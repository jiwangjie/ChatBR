{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "When using ShiftLeft with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text does not shift correctly. In Build 200110251.", "OB": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. In a default text editor, type in the following: \n   - First line: three spaces followed by one tab character and then 'some text' \n   - Second line: one tab character followed by 'some text2' \n2. Highlight both lines and execute the ShiftLeft command. \n   - Observe that nothing moves.", "EB": "After performing the ShiftLeft command, the expected behavior is that both lines are indented the same visually. In this case, the first line should be shifted left to match the indentation of the second line, which means removing the tab character and aligning with the space characters. It is confusing when there is a stray space, as it prevents the text from shifting correctly.", "SR": "To fix the issue: \n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually. \n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command to ensure that the first line is shifted left to the space character at least."}
