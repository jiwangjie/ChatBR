The text does not move. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). In any case, it is confusing when there is a stray space because it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
