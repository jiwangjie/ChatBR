{"id": "4974", "title": "Setting classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When attempting to set the classpath and output location at the same time in Eclipse, an error occurs stating 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This is caused by treating setting the output location and classpath as two separate operations, which creates an illegal state.", "OB": "After pressing 'Ok' in the project properties, I receive the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
