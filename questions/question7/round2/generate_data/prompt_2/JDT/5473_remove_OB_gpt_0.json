The second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab). It is also confusing when there is a stray space, as it prevents the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following lines:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nExpected result: The text should be indented consistently.\nActual result: Nothing happens and the text remains unchanged."}
