This issue occurred while searching for references to a specific field. However, the bug report does not provide details about the observed behavior (OB), expected behavior (EB), and steps to reproduce (SR). Here are the additional details:\n\nOB: When searching for references to the field 'tmpFir' in the external jar, the search results are displayed, but none of the results are being selected/highlighted.\n\nEB: After performing the search for references to the field 'tmpFir' in the external jar, the search results should be properly selected/highlighted.\n\nSR:\n1. Make sure you have JDK1.3.1 set as the default JRE in the IDE.\n2. Ensure that you have the source code for 'rt.jar' available.\n3. Open the 'java.io.File' class in the IDE.\n4. Perform a search for references to the field 'tmpFir' in the external jar.\n\nPlease update the bug report with these additional details."}
