I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, some actions are distributed on a personal taste basis, and it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. This should be changed as all actions need to be reachable from the editor, without forcing users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available on text selection. It can only be found in the Outline view.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available on text selection. It should be accessible directly from the editor, without needing to switch to the Outline view.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the context menu."}
