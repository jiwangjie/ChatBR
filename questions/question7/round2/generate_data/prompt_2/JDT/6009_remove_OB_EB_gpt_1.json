", "OB": "With a .java file open in the editor, clicking the new class button. Checking the 'Enclosing Type' field shows that it is blank.", "EB": "The 'Enclosing Type' field should default to the current type in the editor, accurately reflecting the nested class context.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open a .java file in the editor.\n2. Click the 'New class' button.\n3. Check the 'Enclosing Type' field in the wizard.\n4.
