{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When setting the classpath and output location for a project, it is currently done in separate steps. This bug report suggests that the setting of classpath and output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process. Additionally, the error message displayed when the classpath or output location is incorrect should be improved. The current error message is strange, and it is suggested to change it to: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "OB": "It is not possible to set the classpath and output location for a project in a single operation. The error message displayed when the classpath or output location is incorrect is strange and unclear.", "EB": "The classpath and output location should be set in a single operation. The error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Go to the project properties.\n3. Change the settings to use the project as both the source folder and output location."}
