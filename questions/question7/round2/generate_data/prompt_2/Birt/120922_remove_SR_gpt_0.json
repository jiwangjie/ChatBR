Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. Do you want to save the changes? - Yes, - No, - Cancel. Yes would save the changes, No would discard the changes, Cancel would do nothing and remain on the Source page. In addition, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The main problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very helpful. The error message is 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to improve the dialog title and remove the quotes. Additionally, the message should clearly state that the XML Report Design has been changed.", "SR": ""}
