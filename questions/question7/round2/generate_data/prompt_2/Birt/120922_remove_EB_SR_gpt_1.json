{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922 - 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "When working in the XML Report Designer editor, there is a 'Dirty Page' behavior that needs to be improved. Currently, if you try to switch back to the Layout view after editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, you will receive an error message stating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the error message is not clear and it doesn't provide instructions on how to save or discard the changes. Furthermore, the error dialog is titled 'Error' instead of providing a more descriptive title.\n\nTo clarify, when the error dialog pops up, it presents the following options:\n- Yes: This option would save the changes made to the XML.\n- No: This option would discard the changes made to the XML.\n- Cancel: This option would do nothing and keep the user on the Source page.\n\nIt would be beneficial to have a better error message that clearly indicates the need to save or discard the changes. Additionally, the error dialog should have a more descriptive title.", "OB": "When switching back to the Layout view from the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, an error message pops up indicating that the source page is dirty and the changes need to be saved.", "EB": "When switching back to the Layout view from the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, a clear error message should be displayed, explaining that the changes made to the XML need to be saved or discarded.
