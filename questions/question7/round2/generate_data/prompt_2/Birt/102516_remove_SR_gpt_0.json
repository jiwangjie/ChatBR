{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can easily contain several hundred tables. In the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, although there is a schema filter, I still encounter a warning message on page load because the tree is being populated immediately.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (catalog) on the system, which results in a warning message on page load due to the immediate population of the tree.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user either expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
