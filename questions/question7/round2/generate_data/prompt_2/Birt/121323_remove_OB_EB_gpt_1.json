{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part is entered for the column mapping. The selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way may lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] in the column mapping and leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information in the filterInfo HashMap, even when an XPath expression with a selection part is entered.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] in the column mapping.\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Check if the filter information is still stored in the filterInfo HashMap."}
