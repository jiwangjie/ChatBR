{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema in the data source, resulting in a large number of tables being displayed.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Verify that the tree control initially shows a large number of schemas.\n3. Verify that a warning message is displayed on load since the tree is being populated on load."}
