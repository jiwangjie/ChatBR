{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When I set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML, the report displays the same results.", "EB": "For Plain, I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed. For Auto, I expect the content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags. For HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 to appear literally with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a database field with three types of content:\n\n- HTML text within <html>...</html> tags.\n- HTML fragments not within <html> tags.\n- Text with RTF tags.\n\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field."}
