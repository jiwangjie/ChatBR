{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This is problematic as treating XPath expressions in this way can cause significant issues.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog.", "EB": "The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist and be stored in the filterInfo HashMap when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Verify that the selection is properly stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n5. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog again.\n6. Verify that the previously entered filter information is still present and stored in the filterInfo HashMap."}
