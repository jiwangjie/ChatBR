The problem is that the user is left to figure out how to save the changes or discard them, which is even more difficult. Additionally, the error message is not clear. The error message currently displayed is 'Source page is dirty'.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will receive an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The user is required to determine how to save or discard the changes, which is a challenge. The error message is not helpful as it only says 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more user-friendly approach would be to display a dialog with a clear and informative title, such as 'XML Report Design has been modified'. The dialog should not include unnecessary quotes. ", "SR": ""}
