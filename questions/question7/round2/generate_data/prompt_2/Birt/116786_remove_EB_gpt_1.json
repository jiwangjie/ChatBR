{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the report design stores the absolute path of the library include. For example, <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. For example, the relative path should be saved as <property name='fileName' value='$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open a report design in the BIRT designer.\n2. Include a library from a different location in the project.\n3. Verify that the BIRT designer generates and saves the relative path for the library include."}
