One suggestion is to sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file. This would provide better performance.", "SR": "1. Copy the file to the destination folder.\n2. Implement a new logic for disk sorting that can handle border values in rows efficiently.\n3. Test the sorting process by using data with border values in rows.\n4. Verify that the sorting is done correctly and the performance is improved.\n5. Write the sorted data to the file in the destination folder."}
