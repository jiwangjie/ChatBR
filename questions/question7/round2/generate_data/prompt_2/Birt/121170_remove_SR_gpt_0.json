{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return some user recognizable strings", "description": "When calling the 'get column label' function before extraction, the labels returned are null. However, after extraction, the labels returned are recognizable strings. This behavior should be consistent and the 'get column label' function should return the same user recognizable strings before and after extraction. This is necessary as the labels need to be displayed to the end user before doing the extraction.", "OB": "The 'get column label' function returns null labels before extraction.", "EB": "The 'get column label' function should return the same user recognizable strings before and after extraction.", "SR": "1. Call the 'get column label' function before performing any extraction. 2. Check if the labels returned are null. 3. Extract the data. 4. Call the 'get column label' function again after extraction. 5. Check if the labels returned are now recognizable strings."}
