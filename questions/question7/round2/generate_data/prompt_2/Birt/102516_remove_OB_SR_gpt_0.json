The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, the tables and columns are loaded automatically when the page is opened, causing a delay. It would be more efficient if the load of the tree is deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "Currently, the tables and columns are loaded automatically when the JDBC Data Set Editor page is opened.", "EB": "The tables and columns should be loaded only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter in the JDBC Data Set Editor page.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the tables and columns are automatically loaded.\n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter.\n4. Verify that the tables and columns are loaded on demand."}
