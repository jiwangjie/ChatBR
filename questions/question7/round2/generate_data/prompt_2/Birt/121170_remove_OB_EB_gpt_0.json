{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - getColumnLabel from metaData object returns different results before and after data extraction", "description": "The behavior of the IMetaData.getColumnLabel() method is inconsistent when called before and after data extraction. The expectation is that the method should return user recognizable strings.", "OB": "When calling IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction, it returns empty strings for some columns and non-empty string for others.", "EB": "The IMetaData.getColumnLabel() method should consistently return non-empty strings for all columns both before and after data extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a connection to the data source. \n2. Execute a query that retrieves data. \n3. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() for each column of the result set before and after data extraction. \n4. Note the differences in the returned strings for each column."}
