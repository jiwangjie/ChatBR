{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. Although there is a schema filter implemented in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, there is still a warning message shown on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control on the JDBC Data Set Editor page loads all the schemas and tables on system load. It shows several hundred tables, causing performance issues. When using the code from CVS on 6/30/05, even after applying the schema filter, a warning message is displayed on page load due to the tree being populated on load.", "EB": "The load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve performance and eliminate the warning message displayed on load.", "SR": ""}
