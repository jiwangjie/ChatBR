{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Although a schema filter has been implemented in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema (catalog) on the system instead of only the selected schema(s). The tree is being populated on load, causing a delay and eventually showing a warning message.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
