Other pages cannot be accessed until the changes are saved. Currently, the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. When prompted with the question 'Do you want to save the changes?', selecting 'Yes' saves the changes, 'No' discards the changes, and 'Cancel' does nothing and remains on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog box is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you make changes to the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you receive an error notification indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out how to save the changes or discard them, which is difficult, and the error message is not helpful. The error message says 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more intuitive approach would be to display a dialog stating that the XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog box should have a better title without the quotes.", "SR": ""}
