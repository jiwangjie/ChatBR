The problem is that the user needs to figure out how to save the changes (or discard them, which is even more difficult) and the error message is not clear.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to improve the error message and provide clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes. The dialog should have a more appropriate title and should not contain quotes.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Switch to the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor.\n3.
