{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with boundary row values", "description": "The current implementation of disk sorting is causing issues when there is a boundary value for the row. When sorting on disk, if the data contains 40000 rows and the program is configured to process less than 40000 rows, the following operations are observed:", "OB": "1. <Describe the observed behavior in more detail>", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is a boundary value for row. Rather than writing the sorted data directly to the disk, the program should sort the data in memory and then write it to the disk. This approach should be implemented to improve the sorting process.", "SR": "<Provide the steps required to reproduce the issue, if applicable>"}
