{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor shows every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables. Despite implementing a schema filter, a warning message is still displayed on load because the tree is being populated during this process.", "EB": "The load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
