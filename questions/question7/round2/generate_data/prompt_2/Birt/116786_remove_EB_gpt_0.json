{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include stores absolute path instead of relative path", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer stores the absolute path of the library. For example, the <property name=\"fileName\"/> tag in the report design XML file shows an absolute path, such as 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "", "SR": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. For instance, if the report design is located in '$project/test', and we include a library from '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary', the relative path should be used and stored."}
