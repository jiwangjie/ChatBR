{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "When calling IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before or after data extraction, the returned labels are different. These labels are displayed to the end user, so it's important that they remain consistent.", "OB": "When calling IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction, it does not return the same labels as after extraction.", "EB": "IMetaData.getColumnLabel() should return the same labels before and after data extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction. 2. Call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() after data extraction. Compare the returned labels and note the difference."}
