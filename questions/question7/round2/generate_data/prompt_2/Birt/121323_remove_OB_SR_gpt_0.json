{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not retain the filter information after closing the dialog. This means that each time the dialog is opened, the filter needs to be set again. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior.", "OB": "Currently, when the XML Edit Data Set dialog is opened, the filter field is empty, even if a filter was previously applied. The filter needs to be set each time the dialog is opened, which is time-consuming and inconvenient.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should remember the filter information after closing the dialog. When the dialog is opened again, the previously applied filter should be displayed so that users do not have to set the filter every time they access the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Apply a filter to the data set.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Re-open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n5. Verify that the previously applied filter is retained and displayed in the filter field."}
