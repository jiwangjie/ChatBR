It should optimize the steps involved in the sorting process to increase efficiency.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Sort 40,000 rows of data on disk\n2. Set the program to process less than 40,000 rows\n3. Observe the following operations being performed:\n   a. Saving the file as a temp file\n   b. Calling the file to memory\n   c. Sorting the data\n   d. Saving the file to a temp file"}
