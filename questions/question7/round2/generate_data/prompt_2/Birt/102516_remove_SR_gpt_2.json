{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The current behavior of the JDBC Data Set Editor is that it loads all tables and columns in the data source on page load. This is causing performance issues, especially on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers where there can be several hundred tables. Although there is a schema filter implemented in the code from CVS version 6/30/05, there is still a warning message displayed on page load due to the slow loading of the tree control.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor displays every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which easily includes several hundred tables. The tree control is being populated on page load.", "EB": "The loading of the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve the performance and avoid the warning message on page load.", "SR": ""}
