{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient disk sorting logic needed for border row values", "description": "When sorting data on disk, if the sort operation is performed on 40000 rows of data and the program is configured to handle only a portion of the data (less than 40000 rows), the following operations are performed:", "OB": "1. [Incomplete description]", "EB": "The current logic for disk sorting needs improvement, particularly when dealing with border row values. Instead of performing the sort operation directly on the disk, a more efficient approach would be to sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the disk. This would significantly improve the sorting performance.", "SR": "[Steps to Reproduce - Not provided in the original bug report]"}
