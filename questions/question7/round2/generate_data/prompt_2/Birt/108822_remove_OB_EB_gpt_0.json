The program is supposed to process the data less than 40000 rows, but it is not sorting the data correctly in this scenario. ", "OB": "The program saves the file as a temporary file, loads the file into memory, performs the sorting operation on the data, and saves the sorted file back to the temporary file.", "EB": "The program should accurately sort the data when the row values have border values. It should follow the steps below:  1. Save the file as a temporary file  2. Load the file into memory  3. Perform the sorting operation on the data, considering the border values for row values  4. Save the sorted file back to the temporary file", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Sort a dataset of 40000 rows on disk 2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000 rows 3. Observe the sorting logic applied to the data with border values for row values"}
