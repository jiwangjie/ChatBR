As a result, there are no children nodes listed in the data set editor page of the query tab. Closing and reopening the data set editor does not resolve the issue.", "OB": "No children node listing when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab.", "EB": "I expect to see the children nodes listed when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement.\n2. Open the data set editor and go to the data source page.\n3. Change the data source to a new one that has no database, table, or column information.\n\nExpected result:\n- The data set editor should display the children nodes with information about the databases, tables, and columns from the new data source.\n\nActual result:\n- No children nodes are listed in the data set editor page of the query tab.\n- Closing and reopening the data set editor does not resolve the issue."}
