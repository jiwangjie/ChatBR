This bug report is to address this issue and ensure that invalid date/time values are rejected.", "OB": "When attempting to store an invalid date/time string in a report design, the system does not reject the value and allows it to be saved.", "EB": "The date value should have been validated by both the UI and the Model. If an invalid date/time string is provided, the system should reject it and show an error message indicating that the value is not valid.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the report design form.\n2. Enter an invalid date/time string in any of the date/time fields.\n3. Save the form.\n\nExpected result:\n- The system should validate the date/time value and reject it, showing an error message indicating that the value is not valid."}
