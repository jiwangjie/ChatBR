{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes some time. Eventually, a message saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve the performance of the data set editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the data set editor. 2. Notice that the entire schema is queried and it takes some time. 3. Eventually, a message saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed. Refer to Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> for an additional feature request to filter based on schema."}
