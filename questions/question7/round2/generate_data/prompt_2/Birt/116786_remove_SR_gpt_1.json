{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "I observed that the report design currently stores the absolute path of the included library as shown in the property <propertyname=\"fileName\"/> tag: E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary. This absolute path should be replaced with a relative path.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save a relative path. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, the relative path should be saved as $project/test/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design or open an existing one.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Observe that the absolute path is being stored instead of a relative path.\n5. Save the report design and verify that the absolute path is still present."}
