{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When viewing the report design, I noticed that the library include path is stored as an absolute path instead of a relative path. For example, <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>. This behavior prevents the report from being easily ported to a different environment.", "EB": "The report design should store the library include path as a relative path instead of an absolute path. For example,<property name=\"fileName\" value=\"../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>. This would allow the report to be easily moved to other folders or deployed in different environments without requiring manual path updates.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Open the report design file. 2. Locate the library include path in the XML code. 3. Observe that the path is stored as an absolute path. 4. Save the report design and close it. 5. Open the report design again. 6. Observe that the library include path is still stored as an absolute path instead of a relative path."}
