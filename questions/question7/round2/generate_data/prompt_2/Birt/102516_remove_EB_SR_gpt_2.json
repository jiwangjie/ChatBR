{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Currently, in the code from CVS from 6/30/05, the schema filter is present but the tree is still being populated on load, causing a warning message to appear.", "OB": "When using the iSeries platform with the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand, causing a warning message to appear on load even though the schema filter is implemented.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, allowing for a more efficient and user-friendly interface. The warning message should not appear on load.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers.\n2. Note that the tree control in the editor is populated with all schemas on the system, including several hundred tables.\n3. Observe the warning message that appears on load.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The tree control should only load tables and columns when requested, improving performance.\n- The warning message should not appear on load."}
