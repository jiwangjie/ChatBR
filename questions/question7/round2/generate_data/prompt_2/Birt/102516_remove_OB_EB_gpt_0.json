{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "When opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query, the entire schema is queried and the tables and columns are loaded, causing long loading times. This is problematic when there are a large number of tables and columns in the data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, there is a significant waiting time while the entire schema is queried. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load the tables and columns on demand, allowing for faster loading times and avoiding the limitation of only 500 items in the available list.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the long loading time while the entire schema is queried. Additionally, verify that the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed."}
