{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border values in row data", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for processing disk sorting with border values in row data is not efficient", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to handle disk sorting when there are border values in the row data. This can be achieved by sorting the data directly in memory and then writing it to a file", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000. 3. Observe the following operations: a. Save the file as a temporary file. b. Load the file into memory. c. Sort the data. d. Save the sorted data to the temporary file."}
