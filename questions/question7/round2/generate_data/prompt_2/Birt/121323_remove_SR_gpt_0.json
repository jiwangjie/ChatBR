{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not save the entered filter information. When an XPath expression is entered for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the filterInfo data is not persisted. It is important to note that treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to trouble.", "OB": "When an XPath expression with a selection part is entered for the column mapping, the filter information is lost when leaving the dialog. The data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is not persisted.", "EB": "The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog should be saved and persisted when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part in the column mapping.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog again and check if the filter information is still present."}
