{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Even with the schema filter introduced in the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the warning message still appears on load because the entire schema is queried and populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, when opening the data set editor, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. Eventually, a warning message appears stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The data set editor should load tables and columns on demand, allowing for faster loading times. The warning message about only being able to view 500 items should not appear.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the data set editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers. 2. Observe that the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. 3. Eventually, a warning message appears stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'"}
