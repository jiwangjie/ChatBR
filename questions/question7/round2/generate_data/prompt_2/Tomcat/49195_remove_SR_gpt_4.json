It should be noted that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, an error message stating that there is no shutdown port configured is printed in catalina.20100427.log.", "EB": "It would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await() method.
