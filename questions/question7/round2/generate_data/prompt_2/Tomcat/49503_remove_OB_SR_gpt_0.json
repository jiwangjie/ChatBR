{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "Upon testing, it is observed that when starting Tomcat, the Connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method.", "EB": "I would expect that in the StandardService.initInternal() method, the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught in this method. If the EXIT_ON_INIT_FAILURE flag is set, the exception should be rethrown, and should also be caught in the Catalina.load() method. It should then be rethrown as an Error, which would abort the Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start Tomcat."}
