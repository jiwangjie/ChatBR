That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat stops successfully but prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nIt is important to note that Tomcat stops regardless of this error message. After printing the message, the method Catalina.stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Configure the Tomcat server.xml file to have <Server port=\"1\">\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service\n3. Stop the Tomcat Windows service\n4.
