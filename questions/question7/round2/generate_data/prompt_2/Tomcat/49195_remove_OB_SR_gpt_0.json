{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port='1'> in server.xml, the Windows service works but prints an error message. This bug report suggests improvements in how Tomcat is stopped. System.exit(0) should work regardless of this issue. It is also speculated that jsvc may exhibit similar behavior but has not been tested.", "OB": "The current behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the bug report.", "EB": "It is suggested to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(). This would allow the thread to be woken up by a notifyAll() call or by using the interrupt() call if the thread is known.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Specify <Server port='1'> in the server.xml file.\n2. Start the Windows service.\n3. Check for any error message printed during startup of the service."}
