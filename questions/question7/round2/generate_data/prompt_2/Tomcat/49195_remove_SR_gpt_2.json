{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "The bug report states that specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml allows for two use cases. However, when stopping Tomcat using a Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Although this message is printed, Tomcat still shuts down successfully as CatalinastopServer() performs System.exit(1) after printing the message. It is suggested that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalinaserver should not be null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'", "EB": "Instead of using sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), it would be better to use wait(10000) so that the thread could be woken up by a notifyAll() call, or use the interrupt() method to wake it up if the thread is known.", "SR": ""}
