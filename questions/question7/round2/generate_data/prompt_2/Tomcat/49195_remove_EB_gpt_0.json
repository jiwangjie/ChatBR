{"id": "49195", "title": "Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, Tomcat is able to differentiate between two different use cases. However, there is a minor issue when it comes to stopping Tomcat. The error message displayed in catalina.20100427.log is as follows: \n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServerSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\nWhile this is just a message and Tomcat still stops regardless of it, I believe there could be improvements made to this behavior. It is worth noting that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalinaserver is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, Tomcat is able to stop successfully. However, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file:\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServerSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\nThis message is printed, but it does not impact the functioning of Tomcat as it still shuts down properly.", "EB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, Tomcat should stop successfully without printing any error messages in the catalina log file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Try shutting down the server through an OS signal by calling Catalina.stop()."}
