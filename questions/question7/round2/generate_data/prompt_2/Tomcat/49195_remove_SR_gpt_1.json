{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "The bug report is about specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml and the behavior that follows. The author suggests that there could be improvements on how Tomcat is stopped, but jsvc's behavior is not mentioned. The bug report also mentions that the message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file, but Tomcat stops regardless of it.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with Windows service, Tomcat prints the following message in catalina.20100427.log: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' After printing the message, Tomcat calls Catalina.stopServer() which performs a System.exit(1), resulting in the Tomcat shutdown. The author suggests that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "If the service launcher stops Tomcat, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(). This would allow it to be woken by a notifyAll() call or use the interrupt() call to wake it up if the thread is known.", "SR": ""}
