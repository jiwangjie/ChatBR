{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Incorrect behavior with custom session tracking cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled).\n\nHowever, when testing with the attached cookiename.war file, the session tracking cookie is set with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' as the name of the URI parameter, resulting in a different behavior than expected.", "OB": "When visiting the page 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp', the following cookie is sent:\nSet-Cookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\n\nBut the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' in the URL:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'Reload' link also uses the custom cookie name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' instead of 'jsessionid' in the URL.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Deploy the attached cookiename.war file to a Servlet 3.0-compliant server.\n2. Open the web application in a web browser.\n3. Observe that the session tracking cookie is set with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE'.\n4. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page.\n5. Observe that the URL of the 'Reload' link contains 'jsessionid' instead of the expected custom cookie name."}
