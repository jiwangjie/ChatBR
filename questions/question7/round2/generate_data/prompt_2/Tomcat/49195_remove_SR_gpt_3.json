{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat still stops regardless of this message. After printing the message, Catalina.stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, the following error message is printed in catalina.20100427.log: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'", "EB": "Instead of using sleep(10000), it would be better to use wait(10000) in StandardServer.await() so that it can be woken up by a notifyAll() call, or use an interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": ""}
