{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting", "description": "The issue reported in bug 49299 is that the servlet 3.0 specification in chapter 7.1.1 states that a custom cookie name should affect URL rewriting, but this behavior is not observed. The user expects that the custom cookie name should be used in the URL rewriting process, but instead, the default 'jsessionid' cookie name is used. I have attached a war file that reproduces this issue.", "OB": "When deploying the cookiename.war file and accessing http://localhost:8080/cookiename/, the observed behavior is that the URL generated by the servlet does not include the custom cookie name. Instead, it includes the default 'jsessionid' cookie name.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the URL generated by the servlet should include the custom cookie name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' instead of the default 'jsessionid' cookie name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Deploy the attached cookiename.war file.\n2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/."}
