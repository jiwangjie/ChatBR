{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When starting Tomcat, the Connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method, but only later in the start() method. This issue was observed while testing with the trunk at revision 957942, so it likely affects version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented through separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. This issue breaks the fix for Bug 48625. To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "When running Tomcat with jsvc, it is not able to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80). While I do not use jsvc, I observed this issue when testing the fix for Bug 49030 and Bug 48625 that I applied in r957960.  The second instance fails, but not in the expected way.", "EB": "When starting the second instance, the exception does not occur because the connector does not attempt to bind to the port. The startup sequence continues and then fails in the Server.await() method.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first instance successfully."}
