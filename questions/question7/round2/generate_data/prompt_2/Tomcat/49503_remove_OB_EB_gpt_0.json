{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load()", "description": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() methods. This issue breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce:\n\n1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "The connectors do not bind to their ports during the initial loading of Tomcat.", "EB": "The connectors should bind to their ports during the initial loading of Tomcat.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties:\norg.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
