{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Custom cookie name not affecting URL rewriting", "description": "The bug report states that in Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1, it is mentioned that a custom session tracking cookie name should also be used as the name of the URI parameter when session id is encoded in the URL. However, the actual behavior is that the default 'jsessionid' parameter is used instead. This bug report includes an attached war file ('cookiename.war') that reproduces the issue.", "OB": "When accessing the page at 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/', the page sets a 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' with a value '658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F' and path '/cookiename'. However, the 'Reload' link on the page uses the 'jsessionid' parameter instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "The 'Reload' link on the page should use the custom cookie name ('MYSESSIONCOOKIE') as the name of the URI parameter, as mentioned in Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Deploy the attached war file ('cookiename.war').\n2. Access 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'.\n3. Observe that the 'Reload' link uses the 'jsessionid' parameter instead of the expected custom cookie name."}
