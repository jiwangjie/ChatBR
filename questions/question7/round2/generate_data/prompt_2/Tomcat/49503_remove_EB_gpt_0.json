{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load() but only later in start() method", "description": "When testing with trunk at revision 957942, it was observed that Connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method, but only later in the start() method. This issue is presumed to affect version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods. This issue appears to break the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce this issue: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g. 80). This issue was observed while testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 in revision 957960. The second instance fails, but not in the expected way. The exception does not occur because the connector does not attempt to bind to the port. It only binds when the start() method is called. The startup sequence then continues and fails in Server.await().", "EB": "When starting two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time, the connectors should bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method.", "SR": "To address this issue, add the following line to the conf/catalina.properties file: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true. Then, start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
