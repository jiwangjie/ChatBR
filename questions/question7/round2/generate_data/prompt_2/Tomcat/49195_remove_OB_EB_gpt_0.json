{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message when using shutdown port 1 on Windows service", "description": "When using server.xml3 to specify <Server port=\"1\", starting and stopping the Tomcat service on Windows works correctly. However, an error message is printed. It would be beneficial to improve the shutdown process in Tomcat to avoid this error. It is worth noting that using System.exit(0) to stop Tomcat works regardless of the shutdown port setting, and jsvc may exhibit similar behavior.", "OB": "When starting and stopping the Tomcat service on Windows, an error message is printed when the shutdown port is configured as 1 in server.xml3.", "EB": "When starting and stopping the Tomcat service on Windows with the shutdown port set to 1, no error message should be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling Catalina.stop()."}
