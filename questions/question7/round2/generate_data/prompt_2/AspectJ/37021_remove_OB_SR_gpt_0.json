The source path for .class files from injars is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. To reproduce the issue, please refer to the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/. It is important to note that the current tests may return false positives for this error due to the lack of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. AJDT may simply omit the filename if it makes no sense to AJDT.", "OB": "N/A", "EB": "The expected behavior is to display the source path in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class' in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.", "SR": "1. Go to the location tests/new/binaryWarnings/\n2. Run the code to observe the issue with the source path in the declare warning messages."}
