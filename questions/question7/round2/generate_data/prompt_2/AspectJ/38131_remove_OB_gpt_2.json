This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc -d subpackage subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nA directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory when compiling with ajc.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe same behavior as javac, where the compiled class is placed in the correct subpackage directory without creating an additional directory.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nUse the -d option while correctly compiling classes from a subpackage."}
