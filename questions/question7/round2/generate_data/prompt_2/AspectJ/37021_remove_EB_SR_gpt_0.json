To reproduce the issue, please run the code provided in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. folder. Please note that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It has been observed in AJDT that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it may be omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also instances where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
