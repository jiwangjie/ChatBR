This created an output file with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc command documentation mentions the use of the outjar parameter to put output classes in a zip file, but it doesn't specify that it should also include the MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a command prompt. 2. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar'. 3. Confirm that the resulting jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
