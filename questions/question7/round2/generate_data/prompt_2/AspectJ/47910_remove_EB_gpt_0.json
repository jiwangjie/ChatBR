However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation states that the outjar parameter is used to put output classes in a zip file, but it does not specify how to include the MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the parameters sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, it creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, the resulting file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "I expect that when I use the outjar parameter with ajc, the resulting .jar file should contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the following command: ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar. Then, check the resulting .jar file and confirm that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
