{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nA directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\nExpected Behavior:\nThe behavior should be the same as javac.\n\nSuggested Resolution:\nIt will be nice to have the same behavior as javac in this case.", "OB": "A directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory when compiling the class using ajc.", "EB": "The behavior should be the same as javac, where the compiled class is placed in the subpackage directory without creating another directory with the same name.", "SR": "1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile the class using the command ajc -d subpackage\\Test.java."}
