{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The current behavior of ajc when using the outjar option is that it creates a .jar file without including the METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file. This means that the generated .jar file is not valid. The documentation for ajc states that the outjar option is used to put output classes in a zip file, but it does not mention anything about including the MANIFEST.MF file. This creates confusion as to whether the outjar option is supposed to create a zip file or a .jar file.", "OB": "When I execute the command ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, an output file named my.jar is created. However, when I examine the contents of the file, I see that it does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file that should be located in the METAINF directory. This makes the generated my.jar file invalid as a .jar file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when using the outjar option, the generated .jar file should include the METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file. This ensures that the generated .jar file is valid and can be used properly.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Execute the command ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar\n2. Examine the contents of the generated my.jar file\n3. Verify that the METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file is missing"}
