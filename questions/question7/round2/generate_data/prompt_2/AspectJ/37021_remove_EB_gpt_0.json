See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the problem. These tests have limitations and may return false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it seems that if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars in declare warning messages, the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also instances where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, create declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars. Observe that the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
