The source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main' in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem. To reproduce the issue, please refer to the code in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'. However, please note that these tests may yield false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It seems that AJDT simply omits the filename if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.
