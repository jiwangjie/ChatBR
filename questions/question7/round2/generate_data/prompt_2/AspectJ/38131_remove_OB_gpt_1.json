This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\nTo reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n    package subpackage;\n    public class Test {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n        }\n    }\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nOB: The compiled class is created in a separate directory 'subpackage' under the existing 'subpackage' directory.\nEB: The compiled class should be created directly under the existing 'subpackage' directory, just like javac.\nSR: Use the '-d' option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage."}
