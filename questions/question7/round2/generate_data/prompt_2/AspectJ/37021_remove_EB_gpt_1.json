To reproduce the issue, run the code located in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. This bug report is limited by the fact that it may show false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in the harness verification of messages. It has been observed that in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also instances where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.
