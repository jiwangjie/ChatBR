The problem can be observed by running the tests located in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. However, please note that these tests may produce false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. Additionally, it seems that AJDT omits the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars is listed in the format 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main.class'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars should be listed in the format 'app/Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars and compare the displayed source path format with the expected format. Run the provided tests/new/binaryWarnings/ code to observe the issue."}
