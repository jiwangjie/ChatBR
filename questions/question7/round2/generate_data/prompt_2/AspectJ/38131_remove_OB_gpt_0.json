This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nCreate a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nObserved Behavior: \n\nExpected Behavior: But it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.\n\nSteps to Reproduce: Use the -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage."}
