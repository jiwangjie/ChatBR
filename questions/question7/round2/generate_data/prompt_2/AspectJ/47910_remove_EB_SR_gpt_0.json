However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc's outjar command states that it should put the output classes in a zip file, but naming the parameter outjar is confusing because it implies that it creates a jar file instead.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
