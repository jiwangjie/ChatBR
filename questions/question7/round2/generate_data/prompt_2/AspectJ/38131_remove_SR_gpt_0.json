{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using version 1.1rc1 of the ajc compiler. This bug seems to be a regression since rc1 and is a deviation from the behavior of javac. I suspect that it may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. \n\nTo reproduce the bug, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage. For example:\n   ```java\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n2. Compile the class using the following command: `ajc subpackage\\Test.java`\n\nObserved Behavior (OB): The `Test.class` file is placed in a directory named `subpackage` which is created inside the existing `subpackage` directory.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB): The behavior should be the same as javac, which places the `Test.class` file directly in the `subpackage` directory.\n\nSteps to Reproduce (SR): To fix the problem, run the ajc command with the `-d` option. For example: `ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java`."}
