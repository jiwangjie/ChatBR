{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files. When targeting .class files from injars in the declare warning messages, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem. The problem can be observed by running the code provided in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'. However, please note that these tests may return false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. This issue was noticed in AJDT, where AJDT omits filenames that make no sense to it.", "OB": "The source path in the declare warning messages for .class files from injars is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.
