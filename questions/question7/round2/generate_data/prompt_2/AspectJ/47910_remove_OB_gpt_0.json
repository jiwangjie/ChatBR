However, currently, if a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file is present inside the source directory, it is not included in the output jar file.", "OB": "When I call ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>, an output file is created with a .jar extension.", "EB": "The output file should be a valid jar file containing the METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file from the source directory if it exists.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use the ajc command with the sourceroots option to specify the source directory.\n2. Add a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside the source directory.\n3. Use the outjar option to specify the output jar file.\n4. Verify that the resulting jar file does not contain the METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file."}
