This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe behavior should be the same as javac.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nInclude the -d option while correctly compiling classes from a subpackage.", "OB": "You will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "The behavior should be the same as javac.", "SR": "Include the -d option while correctly compiling classes from a subpackage."}
