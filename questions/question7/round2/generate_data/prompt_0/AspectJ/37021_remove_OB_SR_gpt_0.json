See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main.'", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath should be listed in the form 'app/Main.'", "SR": "1. Open tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. code\n2. Compile and run the code\n3. Check the declare warning messages"}
