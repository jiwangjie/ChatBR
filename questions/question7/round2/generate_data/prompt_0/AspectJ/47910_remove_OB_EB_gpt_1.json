{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The current behavior of the ajc command is that it creates an output file with a .jar extension, but this file does not contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file. This is an issue when performing the specified steps with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.", "OB": "When using the ajc command with the specified source roots and output jar file, a file with a .jar extension is created. However, this file does not contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the output file, created by invoking the ajc command with the specified source roots and output jar file, should contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file. This file is necessary for the jar file to be considered valid.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the ajc command line interface.\n2. Specify the source roots using the 'sourceroots' flag followed by the directory path.\n3. Specify the output jar file using the 'outjar' flag followed by the desired jar file name.\n4. Execute the command.\n5. Look for the output file with a .jar extension.\n6. Verify that the jar file does not contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file."}
