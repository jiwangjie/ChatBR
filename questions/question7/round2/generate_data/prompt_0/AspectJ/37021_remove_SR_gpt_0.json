See 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' for code to run to reproduce the problem. Please note that these tests may give false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, the filename may be omitted if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.)", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. I have also encountered cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Navigate to the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' directory.\n2. Run the provided code.\n3. Observe the declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars to see that the source path is incorrect."}
