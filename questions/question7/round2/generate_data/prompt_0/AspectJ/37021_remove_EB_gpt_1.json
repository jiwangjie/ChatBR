{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files. The problem can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. Test limitations: These tests might return false positives when detecting the error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that issue.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'. Additionally, the filenames should always be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Run the code in the tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. directory. \n2. Observe the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars and verify that the source path is listed in the correct format and that the filenames are always displayed."}
