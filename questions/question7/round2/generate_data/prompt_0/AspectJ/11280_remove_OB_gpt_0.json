{"id": "11280", "title": "Bug 11280[View Mgmt] Switching perspectives loses view maximized state", "description": "", "OB": "When switching perspectives from Java to Resource and back to Java, the CVS repository view is no longer maximized. It reverts to its original size and position.", "EB": "The CVS repository view should stay maximized even after switching perspectives. It should retain its maximized state until explicitly minimized by the user.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the CVS repository view in the Java perspective. 2. Double click the title bar to maximize it. 3. Switch to the Resource perspective. 4. Return to the Java perspective."}
