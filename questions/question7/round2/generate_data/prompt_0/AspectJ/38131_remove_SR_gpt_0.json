This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with the change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nCreate a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. subpackage\\Test.java or javac subpackage\\Test.java\n\nNo big deal, really.", "OB": "When running the ajc command to compile Test.java in the subpackage, the resulting test.class file is put in subpackage\\subpackage directory.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to have the same behavior as javac, which would put the test.class in the subpackage directory instead of creating a subpackage\\subpackage directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile the class using the command 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java'.\n3. Note the resulting location of the compiled test.class file."}
