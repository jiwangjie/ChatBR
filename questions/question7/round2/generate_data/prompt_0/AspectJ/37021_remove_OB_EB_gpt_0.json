See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the issue. These tests produce false positives as filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (AJDT may omit filenames if they don't make sense to AJDT.)", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages targeting .class files is displayed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be displayed in the form 'app/Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Navigate to the tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. directory.\n2. Run the code found in this directory.\n3. Observe the declare warning messages and note that the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'."}
