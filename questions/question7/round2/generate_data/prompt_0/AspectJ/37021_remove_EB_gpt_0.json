The issue can be observed by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. Limitations of these tests include false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. Additionally, in AJDT, if the filename is invalid, it may be omitted.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the source path in 'declare warning' messages is displayed in the format 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that in some cases, the filenames may not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that specific issue.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Observe the source path in the 'declare warning' messages when targeting .class files from injars - it should be displayed in the format 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'."}
