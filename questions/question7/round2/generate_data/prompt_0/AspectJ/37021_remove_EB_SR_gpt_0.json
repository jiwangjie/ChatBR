See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the problem. These tests have limitations and may produce false positives when filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages.", "OB": "In declare warning messages that target .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes, the filenames do not appear at all in the warnings.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed in the form 'app/Main.class' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. \n2. Observe the declare warning messages for binary files and check the source paths."}
