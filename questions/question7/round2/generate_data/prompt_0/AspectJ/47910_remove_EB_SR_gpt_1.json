{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The ajc command is not including the MANIFEST.MF file in the generated jar file.", "OB": "When I execute the ajc command with the sourceroots option, the outjar option, and a jar file name, it creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, the generated file does not include the MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc command's documentation suggests that the outjar option is intended to create a zip file, but it does not make sense for a parameter called outjar to generate a zip file.", "EB": "The ajc command should include the MANIFEST.MF file in the generated jar file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Execute the ajc command with the sourceroots option.\n2. Specify the outjar option followed by the desired jar file name.\n3. Verify that the generated jar file includes the MANIFEST.MF file."}
