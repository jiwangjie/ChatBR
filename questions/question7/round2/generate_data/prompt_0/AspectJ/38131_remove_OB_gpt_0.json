This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");\n\n}}\n\nThen compile using the following command:\n\najc -d subpackage\\ subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nSo, the expected behavior is to have the same behavior as javac.", "OB": "When compiling a class from a subpackage using the ajc command, a new directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "But it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use the ajc command with the -d option while correctly compiling classes from a subpackage."}
