However, this file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, making it an invalid jar file.", "EB": "If the 'outjar' option is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file that includes the MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: \n1. Execute the 'ajc' command with the 'sourceroots' option, providing the necessary source roots. \n2. Specify the 'outjar' option, followed by the desired output file name and extension. \n3. Verify that the generated jar file includes the MANIFEST.MF file."}
