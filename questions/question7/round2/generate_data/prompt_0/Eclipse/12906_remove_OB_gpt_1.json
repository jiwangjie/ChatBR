No warning or error message is displayed.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning or error message displayed when attempting to open a file in another editor while it is already opened in one editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the Java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected Result: The workbench should display a warning message saying that you may overwrite changes and ask if you want to continue, or an error message stating that all files should be closed first before opening another editor. This behavior is expected as a safety feature where the tool doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in the tool."}
