{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752 - Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as \"foo.txt\").\n3. From the main menu, select File > Export and select Zip File to export.\n4. In the \"Export\" dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (such as \"test.zip\"), and begin the export to zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up: \"Problems were encountered during export,\" and the detail lists the file of the same name in project2 as the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe export process should successfully create a zip file containing all selected projects with their respective files, including files with the same name under different directories.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nFollow the steps mentioned in the description section."}
