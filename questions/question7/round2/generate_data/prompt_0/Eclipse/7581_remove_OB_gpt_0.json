{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The combo box in the property sheet does not resize correctly when the width of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column. As a result, the drop-down button may be clipped and not visible within the property sheet.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column, similar to how the DialogCellEditor (Button always visible) behaves. It should adjust its size to fit the widest string but still keep the drop-down button within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Use the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects with name-value pairs in two columns.\n2. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create a cell editor with a ComboBoxCellEditor, passing in a list of strings.\n3. Make at least one of the strings wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box grows to the width of the widest string, causing the drop-down button to be clipped off the visible area of the property sheet."}
