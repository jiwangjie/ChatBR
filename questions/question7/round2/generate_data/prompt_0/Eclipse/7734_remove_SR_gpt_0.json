Start WSWB and create a new project. \n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. \n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. \n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer. \n\nExpected Results: The 'Do you want to save your file?' dialog box should be displayed, allowing the user to choose whether to save or discard changes before proceeding with the shutdown."}
