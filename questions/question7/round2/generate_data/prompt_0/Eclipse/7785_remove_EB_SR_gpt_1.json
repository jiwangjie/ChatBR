The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When I open an existing java file and modify it by moving an existing class, then click the SaveAs icon next to the Save icon, a dialog will appear. After browsing for a valid container location and typing the filename (ignoring the extension which isn't requested), I click OK. The Navigator adds the file in the specified location, but it does not show the file extension.", "EB": "I expect the SaveAs function to remember the file type and display the file extension in the Navigator after saving the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open an existing java file.\n2. Modify the file by moving an existing class.\n3. Click the SaveAs icon next to the Save icon.\n4. In the dialog that appears, browse for a valid container location.\n5. Type the filename, but ignore the extension.\n6. Click OK.\n7. Observe that the file is added to the Navigator without displaying the file extension."}
