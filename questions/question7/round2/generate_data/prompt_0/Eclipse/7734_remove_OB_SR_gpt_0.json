{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when the system is shut down, there are no warnings or prompts displayed to the user regarding unsaved files or any indication of potential data loss.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the system to provide a dialog box with the message 'Do you want to save your file?', along with options to choose from like 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' (which would halt the shutdown process). This dialog box should be triggered when the user attempts to shut down the system while there are unsaved files or pending changes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open any application that supports file editing.\n2. Make some changes to the file but do not save them.\n3. Attempt to shut down the system.\n4. Observe the absence of any warnings or prompts related to unsaved files."}
