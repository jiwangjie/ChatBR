{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller on Linux, running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000), the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label. This behavior can confuse users.", "EB": "The tool items, including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon, should stay on the same line as the label no matter how small the view is resized. The close button should be located to the far right corner, as users are accustomed to.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Observe that the tool items (pulldown menu icon and close icon) move below the label."}
