{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly. When a string in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the width of the widest item. However, the drop down button may now be positioned too far to the right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should size itself correctly, ensuring that the drop down button is always within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object using a row of name-value pairs with two columns.\n3. Create a ComboBoxCellEditor by implementing IPropertyDescriptor and using the method to create the cell editor.\n4. Ensure that one of the ComboBoxCellEditor strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor grows to accommodate the widest item, but the drop down button may be clipped outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
