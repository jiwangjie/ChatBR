However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller on Linux, the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), are moving below the label. This behavior is not observed in build 20011116 on Nt2000.", "EB": "The close icon (X) and pulldown menu icon (triangle) should stay in their positions even when the view is resized smaller on Linux.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n3. Observe the movement of the tool items, pulldown menu icon, and the close icon."}
