", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet.", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. It needs further investigation to determine if this is caused by us or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the property sheet, select a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor, and observe that the combo box does not have the correct width. Compare it to the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible and the combo box should have the same width as the property sheet column."}
