Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel any changes made to the working sets, including cancelling the remove action.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a working set with one project and select it. This should cause the package view to be filtered.\n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set. Delete the first working set."}
