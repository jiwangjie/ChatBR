It does not match the width of the property sheet column. Instead, it is smaller than the column width, causing visual misalignment.", "EB": "I would expect the ComboBoxCellEditor to always match the width of the property sheet column. This behavior should be consistent with the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Select a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the combobox is smaller than the column width, causing visual misalignment."}
