{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On Linux, running build 20011127, when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label. This behavior is not observed in build 20011116 on Nt2000. If the icons start moving around, it can confuse users.", "EB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) should remain aligned with the label, instead of moving below it. This behavior should be consistent across different builds and platforms.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Launch the application on Linux, running build 20011127.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view to make it smaller.\n4. Observe that the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon, move below the label."}
