There should be a warning message displayed in the workbench, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be shown, instructing the user to close all instances of the file first. It is believed that this behavior is a safety feature in WSAD to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, if the user tries to open the same file in another editor by right-clicking on it and selecting 'Open With..System Editor', a warning message should be displayed in the workbench, indicating that the user may overwrite changes and asking for confirmation to proceed. If multiple instances of the file are already open, an error message should be shown, instructing the user to close all instances of the file before attempting to open it in another editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Close the file if it is already opened. \n2. Go to the Java Perspective. \n3. Open a Java file by double-clicking on it. \n4. The file is now opened in the workbench. \n5. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. \n6. Observe that nothing happens. \nExpected: A warning message should be displayed in the workbench, indicating potential changes overwrite and asking for confirmation. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, instructing the user to close all instances of the file first."}
