", "OB": "When creating a new file, the line delimiter used is currently determined by the value returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). However, this default behavior does not always meet the user's requirements.", "EB": "The software should provide a user interface that allows users to define the default line delimiters for new files. This way, users can customize the line delimiter according to their specific needs.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use a Unix and Windows workstation to develop a Unix product/program.\n2. Create a new file in the software.\n3. Observe that the line delimiter used for the new file is based on the System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\") value."}
