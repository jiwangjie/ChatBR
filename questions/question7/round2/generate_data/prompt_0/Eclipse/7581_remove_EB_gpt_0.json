{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in Property Sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the Property Sheet does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the editor's dropdown menu is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to fit the width of the widest item. However, this causes the dropdown button to be positioned too far right, outside of the visible area of the property sheet. As a result, users cannot see the dropdown button without widening the property sheet view.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object using a set of rows that are name-value pairs, with each column defined by an IPropertyDescriptor.\n3. Create a cell editor using IPropertyDescriptor's createCellEditor method, specifically a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n4. Set the ComboBoxCellEditor's dropdown menu items to include strings wider than the column's width.\n5. The ComboBoxCellEditor should appear in column two of the property sheet, with the dropdown button at the right edge of the column.\n6. Observe that the dropdown button is positioned too far right and is clipped off the visible area of the property sheet."}
