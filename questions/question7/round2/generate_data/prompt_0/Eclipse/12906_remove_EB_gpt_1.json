There is no warning message or error message displayed.", "EB": "When a java file is already opened in one editor, and the user tries to open it with another editor, the workbench should display a warning message indicating that the user may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be shown stating that all files should be closed first before opening in another editor. This behavior should be implemented as a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "SR": "1.
