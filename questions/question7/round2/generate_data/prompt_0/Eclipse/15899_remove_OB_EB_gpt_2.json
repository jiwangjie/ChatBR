No clear pattern or specific conditions for this behavior can be identified.", "EB": "The 'Close All Saved' functionality should close all open editors that have unsaved changes without exceptions. It is expected to provide a reliable and consistent experience for users, ensuring that all modified files are closed without any ambiguity.", "SR": "1. Open the application with build 20020508 and the latest UI code.\n2. Open multiple editors and make changes to some files.\n3. Select 'Close All Saved' from the file menu.\n4. Observe which editors are closed and which ones remain open. Repeat the process to check for consistency."}
