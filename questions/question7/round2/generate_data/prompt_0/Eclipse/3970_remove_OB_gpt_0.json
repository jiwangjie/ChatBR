There should be a UI in the Workbench Preferences to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for line delimiters are: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario: Use both Unix and Windows workstations to develop a Unix product / program."}
