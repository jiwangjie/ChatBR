However, when removing the working set, the package view is immediately refiltered in the background.", "EB": "At the moment of delete, the package view in the background should not refilter. Instead, the refiltering should only happen when closing the working set selection dialog, not during the manipulation of the working set. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to the working set, including canceling the remove operation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a working set with one project.\n2. Select the created working set in the package view.\n3. Delete the working set.\n4. Observe that the package view is immediately refiltered, which is unexpected."}
