However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. A UI (Preference) should be provided to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values should include Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure all plugins use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3.
