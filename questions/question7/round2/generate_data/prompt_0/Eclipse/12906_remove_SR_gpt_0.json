{"id": "12906", "title": "Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] If file is already opened in one editor, cannot open in another editor (should give error msg)", "description": "Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] If file is already opened in one editor, cannot open in another editor (should give error msg)", "OB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open it in another editor does nothing. There is no warning or error message shown to indicate that the file cannot be opened in multiple editors simultaneously. This behavior is observed in the Java Perspective.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning or error message displayed when a user tries to open a file in another editor while it is already opened in one editor. The message should inform the user that opening the file in another editor may overwrite any changes made, and prompt them to confirm if they want to continue. Alternatively, the message should warn the user to close the file in the current editor before opening it in another editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Close any opened files.  \n2. Switch to the Java Perspective.  \n3. Open a Java file by double clicking on it.  \n4. Right click on the opened Java file.  \n5. Select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.  \n   - Expected: A warning or error message should be shown to indicate that opening the file in another editor is not allowed.  \n   - Observed: Nothing happens and the file remains opened in the current editor."}
