{"id": "7734", "title": "System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with a dirty .txt file and Windows is shut down, the system immediately shuts down/reboots without warning or prompting the user to save their changes to the file.", "EB": "The system should provide a dialog box with the message 'Do you want to save your file?' and options for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' to halt the shutdown. Additionally, it would be useful to allow applications to control the shutdown/save process or to allow them to display their own windows that include an option to stop the shutdown if 'Cancel' is selected.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n\n1. Start WSWB.\n2. Create a new project.\n3. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n4. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n5. Left-click on the Windows Start menu.\n6. Select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nA warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their dirty model(s) before the computer is shut down/rebooted."}
