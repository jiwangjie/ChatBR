Then, 'Open With...' and 'Default Text Editor' options are chosen. However, nothing happens; the current editor is not changed.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when selecting a different editor type with 'Open With...', a new editor should open for the selected file, even if it is already open. This behavior should occur because the editor type is different.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the 'test.xml' file using the scripted resource editor example. 2. Open a new basic project. 3. Create a new file named 'test.xml' in the project. 4. Select the newly created 'test.xml' file in the Navigator. 5. Right-click on the file and choose 'Open With...' > 'Default Text Editor'. 6. Observe that no new editor is opened, and the existing editor remains active for the file."}
