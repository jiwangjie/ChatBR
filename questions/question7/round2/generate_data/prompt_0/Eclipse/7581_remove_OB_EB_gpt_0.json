{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in Property Sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "The combo box cell editor in the Property Sheet may not size correctly when the width of a string is wider than the column's width. The combo box grows to match the width of the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "The combo box cell editor should properly adjust its width to accommodate all the items in the drop-down list without extending beyond the visible area of the property sheet. The drop-down button should always be visible to the user.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the Property Sheet with objects containing name-value pairs in two columns.\n2. Use the IPropertyDescriptor to create a ComboBoxCellEditor for column two, providing a set of strings.\n3. Ensure that one of the strings is wider than the width of the column.\n4. Observe that the combo box extends its width to match the widest string, causing the drop-down button to be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
