{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The current behavior is that the report design stores the absolute path of the library include. For example, <property name=\"fileName\"/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the library include should store the relative path instead of the absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a report design file that includes a library.\n2. Check the property named 'fileName' for the library include.\n3. Confirm that the path is an absolute path instead of a relative path."}
