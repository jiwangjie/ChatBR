{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If an XPath expression with a selection part, like 'section[@id='left']', is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation class, which holds this information, gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to use the plain XPath expression, with the path from the data set selector prepended, and let filtering be something for those who need it.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, like 'section[@id='left']'. 3. Observe that when leaving the dialog, the filter information stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
