{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path for the included library (e.g., 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary') instead of saving the relative path. The absolute path is visible in the property elements: <property name='fileName'/> and <property name='namespace'/>.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library from a different directory.\n4. Observe that the absolute path of the library is stored in the report design.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path of the included library.\n2. Example: If the report design is located at '$project/test' and the library is located at '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary', the relative path should be used in the report design."}
