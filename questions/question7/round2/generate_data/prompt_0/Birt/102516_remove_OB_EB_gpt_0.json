The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The data set editor should load tables and columns on demand instead of querying the entire schema at once. It should also allow filtering based on the schema.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the long waiting time while the entire schema is queried. Also, note the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'"}
