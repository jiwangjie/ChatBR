{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "<Provide a clear and accurate statement describing the observed behavior>", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, and the library is included from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should reflect this location.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design located at $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Check the generated relative path for the included library and verify if it matches the expected path based on the locations of the report design and the library."}
