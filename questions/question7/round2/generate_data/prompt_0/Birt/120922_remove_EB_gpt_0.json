Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. When prompted to save the changes, selecting 'Yes' saves the changes, 'No' discards the changes, and 'Cancel' does nothing and remains on the Source page. The dialog is titled 'Error'.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating the need to save the changes. The current problem is that the user has to figure out how to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not clear. The error message specifically states 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and attempting to switch back to the Layout view, a prompt should appear asking the user if they want to save their changes. The options presented should be clear and intuitive, such as 'Save', 'Discard', and 'Cancel'. The dialog should be titled appropriately, without using quotation marks.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Switch to the 'source' view of the Layout Editor.\n3. Make changes to the XML.\n4. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n\nNote: The error message 'Source page is dirty' should be displayed, indicating the need to save or discard the changes."}
