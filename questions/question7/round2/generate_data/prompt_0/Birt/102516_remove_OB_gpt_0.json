{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. When the data set editor is opened you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. The user eventually gets the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The data set editor should defer loading the tables and columns until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve the loading time and avoid the limitation of only displaying 500 items.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the data set editor. \n2. Observe the long loading time and the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'"}
