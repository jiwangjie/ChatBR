Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. There is a dialog that asks 'Do you want to save the changes?'. It provides the options: 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, selecting 'No' would discard the changes, and selecting 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "The current behavior of the XML Report Designer editor is that other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. A dialog titled 'Error' (including the quotes) appears, asking the user if they want to save the changes. The dialog provides the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be for the dialog to have a more appropriate title and not include the quotes. The text of the dialog should inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open the XML Report Designer editor and make changes to the source. Navigate to other pages and observe that they cannot be used until the source is saved. The dialog asking to save the changes should appear when attempting to navigate away from the source page."}
