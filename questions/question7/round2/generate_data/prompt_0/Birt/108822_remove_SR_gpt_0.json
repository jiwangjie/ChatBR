{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border values", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk, if there are 40000 rows and the program is configured to process less than 40000, the following operations are performed:", "EB": "Bug 108822 - More efficient logic is expected to handle disk sorting with border values. A better approach would be to sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file. Additionally, the file should be copied to the destination folder.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Set the program configuration to process less than 40000 rows of data.\n2. Perform disk sorting on a dataset with 40000 rows.\n3. Verify the behavior during the sorting process and compare with expected behavior."}
