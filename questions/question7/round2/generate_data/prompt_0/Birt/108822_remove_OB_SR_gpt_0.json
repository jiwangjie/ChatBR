{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822: More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border values in row", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for disk sorting when there is a border value for the row does not efficiently process the disk sorting.", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to be implemented to process the disk sorting when there is a border value for the row. Instead of sorting the data on disk, it should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Copy the file to the destination folder where sorting is required. \n2. Observe that the current logic for disk sorting does not efficiently handle border values in rows. \n3. Implement a more efficient logic that sorts the data directly in memory and then writes it to the file. \n4. Verify that the data is sorted correctly and the border values in rows are properly handled."}
