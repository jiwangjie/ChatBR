For example, in the property <property name=\"fileName\">E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The report design should store the relative path of the library file instead of the absolute path. For example, it should be saved as <property name=\"fileName\">../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design in the folder $project/test.\n3. Include a library file located in the folder $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary in the report design."}
