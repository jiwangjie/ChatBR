{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The current behavior is that the report design stores the absolute path of the library file. For example: `<property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>` and `<property name='namespace' value='lib1'/>`.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path instead of the absolute path. For example, if my report design is located at `$project/test`, it should reference the library with a relative path.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Verify that the library file path stored in the report design is a relative path based on the location of the report design file."}
