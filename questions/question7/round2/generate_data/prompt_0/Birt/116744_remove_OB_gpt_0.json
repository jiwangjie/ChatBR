{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "The report displays the same results regardless of the Content Type property set for the dynamic text element. No matter if it's set to Auto, Plain, or HTML, the output remains unchanged.", "EB": "The expected behavior is as follows:\n- For Plain, the output should display the literal content including any tags.\n- For Auto, the output should display content 1, 2, and 3 correctly without any HTML or RTF tags.\n- For HTML, the output should display content 1 and 2 correctly without HTML tags, while content 3 should be displayed with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Have a database field with three types of content:\n   a) HTML text within <html>...</html> tags.\n   b) HTML fragments not within <html> tags.\n   c) Text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field."}
