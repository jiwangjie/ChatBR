Specifically, it fails to handle three types of content: 1) HTML text within <html>...</html> tags, 2) HTML fragments not within <html> tags, and 3) Text with RTF tags.", "EB": "The expected behavior is as follows:\n- For Plain, the output should display the literal content including any tags.\n- For Auto, the output should display content 1, 2, and 3 correctly without any HTML or RTF tags.\n- For HTML, the output should display content 1 and 2 correctly without HTML tags, while content 3 should be displayed with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1) Create a database field with the mentioned types of content. 2) Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of the field and observe that it does not handle the different types correctly."}
