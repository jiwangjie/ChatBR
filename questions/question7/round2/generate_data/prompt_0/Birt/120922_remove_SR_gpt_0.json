Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The options given are: Yes (to save the changes), No (to discard the changes), and Cancel (to do nothing and remain on the Source page). In addition, the dialog is titled \"Error\".\n\nIf you edit the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very clear. The error message is \"Source page is dirty\".", "OB": "When editing the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor and attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed stating that the source page needs to be saved. This error message is titled \"Source page is dirty.\".", "EB": "A more user-friendly approach would be to improve the error message text and title. The message should inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed and provide clearer instructions on how to save or discard the changes.
