{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path.", "OB": "Currently, when including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer is not saving the relative path. Instead, it is storing the absolute path of the library.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should store the relative path of the included library.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open a report design in the BIRT designer. \n2. Include a library from a different location, using a relative path. \n3. Save the report design. \n4. Close the BIRT designer. \n5. Reopen the report design and verify that the included library still has the relative path."}
