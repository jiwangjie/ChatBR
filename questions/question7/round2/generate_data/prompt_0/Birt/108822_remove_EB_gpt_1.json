{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic needed to process disk sorting with border values for row values", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk with a total of 40000 rows, the program processes only a portion of the data (less than 40000 rows). The program performs the following operations: 1. Saves the data as a temporary file. 2. Loads the temporary file into memory. 3. Performs a sorting operation on the data. 4. Saves the sorted data into another temporary file.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process less than 40000 rows of data. 3. Observe the program performing the operations mentioned above."}
