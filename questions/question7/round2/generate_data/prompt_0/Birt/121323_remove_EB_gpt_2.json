{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the relation information is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This can lead to trouble in treating XPath expressions in this way.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap to the .rptdesign file when the user leaves the dialog.",  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, for example, 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Open the .rptdesign file and check if the relation information is persisted while the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
