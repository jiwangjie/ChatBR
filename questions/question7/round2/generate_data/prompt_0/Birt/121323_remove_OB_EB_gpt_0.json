{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "If one enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], then within class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but data stored in filterInfo is lost. The expected behavior is that the filter information should persist when leaving the dialog. To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check if the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
