The file is saved as a temporary file.\n2. The file is loaded into memory.\n3. Sorting is applied to the data.\n4. The file is saved to the temporary file.", "EB": "The sorting logic for border values needs to be improved to handle the specified number of rows correctly. The sorting operations should not be affected by the number of rows being processed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set the program to sort a disk on a dataset of 40000 rows.\n2. Configure the program to process less than 40000 rows.\n3. Follow the steps mentioned in the observed behavior section."}
