The specific steps to reproduce the issue are as follows: 1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement. 2. The new data source does not have any information regarding the database, table, or column. The actual result is that there is no listing of children nodes when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab. To replicate the issue, close the data set editor and then reopen it.", "EB": "The expected result is that when changing the data source, the children nodes of the new data source should be listed out.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1.
