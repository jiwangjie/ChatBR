", "EB": "The software should have a more efficient logic for processing disk sorting with a border row value. Specifically, the software should optimize the sorting process to avoid unnecessary steps and improve performance.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process less than 40000 rows of data. 3. Observe the steps performed by the software, including saving the file as a temp file, calling the file to memory, sorting the data, and saving the file to a temp file."}
