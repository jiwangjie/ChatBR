{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'] in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior leads to trouble as XPath expressions are not properly handled.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap to the .rptdesign file when the user leaves the dialog.",  "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, including a selection part like section[@id='left']. \n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. \n4. Leave the dialog. \n5. Note that the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
