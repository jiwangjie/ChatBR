The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source.\n\nOn the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system. This can easily include several hundred tables. The code from CVS dated 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but despite this, I still encounter a warning message on load because the tree is being populated on load.\n\nCould the loading of the tree be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter?", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, when opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query, the tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source shows every schema on the system, resulting in a large number of tables being displayed. Despite the presence of a schema filter, a warning message is displayed on load due to the tree being populated during the loading process.", "EB": "The tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be loaded on demand, meaning that tables and columns should only be populated and displayed when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Access the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the tree control displays all the schemas and their tables and columns.\n3. Notice the warning message displayed on load.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe tree control should only load and display tables and columns when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. The warning message should not be displayed on load."}
