An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected.", "OB": "When creating a \"DateTime\" type report parameter in BIRT report designer, if an invalid date string, such as \"55/66/9999\", is entered in the \"default value\" field, the invalid value is accepted and is displayed in the report design as:<parameters><scalarparameter name=\"dateParam1\"><property name=\"dataType\">dateTime</property><property name=\"allowBlank\">false</property><property name=\"format\">Unformatted</property><property name=\"controlType\">textbox</property><expression name=\"defaultValue\">55/66/9999</expression></scalarparameter></parameters>. There are two problems here: (1) The model should have stored a dateTime type constant using the XML schema date/time format (yyyymmddThh:mm:ss, see [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema2/]), which is locale-independent, to ensure portability.", "EB": "(2) The date value should have been validated by both the UI and Model to reject invalid date/time strings.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the BIRT report designer.\n2. Create a new report parameter and set its type to \"DateTime\".\n3. Enter an invalid date string, such as \"55/66/9999\", in the \"default value\" field.\n4. Observe that the invalid value is accepted and is displayed in the report design as described in the observed behavior section."}
