{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter; however, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The data set editor should load the tables and columns on demand instead of populating them all at once on page load. The schema filter should work properly and the warning message should not appear.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the data set editor. \n2. Observe the loading process and the appearance of the warning message. \nNote: Bug 101372 requests the ability to filter based on schema."}
