{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path instead of an absolute path. For example, if my report design is located at $project/test and I include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved as ../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary."}
