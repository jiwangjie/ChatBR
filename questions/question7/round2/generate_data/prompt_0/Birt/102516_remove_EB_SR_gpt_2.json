On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter. However, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in a large number of tables. The schema filter is applied, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated immediately.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, rather than loading all of them on page load. This would avoid the warning message and improve the performance.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe the tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source.\n3. Notice that it shows every schema (catalog) on the iSeries platform.\n4. Add the schema filter to the control.\n5. Load the page and observe the warning message on load due to the tree being populated immediately."}
