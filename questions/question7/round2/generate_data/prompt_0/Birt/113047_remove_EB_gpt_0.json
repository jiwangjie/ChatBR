The actual result is that there are no children nodes listed after changing the data source. This issue can be reproduced by following these steps: 1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement. 2. In the data set editor, go to the data source page and change the data source. 3. The new data source has no database/table/column information. Close the data set editor and reopen it.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: 1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement. 2. In the data set editor, go to the data source page. 3. Change the data source. 4. Verify that the new data source has no database/table/column information.
