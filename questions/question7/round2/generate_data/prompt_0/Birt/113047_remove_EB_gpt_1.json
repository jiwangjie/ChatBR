After creating a new data set without an SQL statement, if the new data source does not have any database/table/column information, the expected children node listing is missing. Closing and reopening the data set editor does not resolve the issue.", "EB": "When changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab, the children node listing should be displayed correctly. Even if the new data source does not have any database/table/column information, the children node listing should still be visible.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement. 2. Open the data set editor and go to the data source page. 3. Change the data source to one that does not have any database/table/column information. 4. Notice that the children node listing is missing. 5. Close the data set editor and reopen it."}
