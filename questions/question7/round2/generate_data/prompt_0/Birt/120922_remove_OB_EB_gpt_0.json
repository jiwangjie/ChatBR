{"id": "120922", "title": "Dirty Page behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "When editing XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor in XML Report Designer, if the user tries to switch back to the Layout view without saving their changes, they receive an error message. The error message states that the 'Source page is dirty' (including the quotes) and suggests saving or discarding the changes. The user is presented with three options: 'Yes' to save the changes, 'No' to discard the changes, and 'Cancel' to do nothing and remain on the Source page. However, the error dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes). This behavior needs improvement as it requires the user to figure out how to save or discard their changes, and the error message is not very clear.", "OB": "When trying to switch from the 'source' view to the Layout view without saving changes in the XML Report Designer, an error message is displayed stating 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "The user should be prompted with an informative dialog when attempting to switch from the 'source' view to the Layout view without saving changes in the XML Report Designer.

Edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor. 3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view without saving the changes.
