Specifically, the data should be sorted directly in memory before writing it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. \n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000 rows. \n3. Observe the following operations: \n   a. Save the file as a temporary file. \n   b. Load the file into memory. \n   c. Sort the data in memory. \n   d. Save the sorted data back to the temporary file."}
