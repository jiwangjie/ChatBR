{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744 - Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "The dynamic text element fails to apply the specified content type when displaying the content of a database field. Regardless of the content type (HTML, HTML fragments, or RTF-tagged text), the output appears unchanged.", "EB": "I expect the dynamic text element to correctly interpret and display content based on its content type settings. For HTML text within <html>...</html> tags, the formatting should be rendered appropriately. For HTML fragments not within <html> tags, the content should be displayed correctly. Similarly, for text with RTF tags, the dynamic text element should interpret and render the formatting as expected.", "SR": "1. Create a database field with three types of content: \n   a) HTML text within <html>...</html> tags. \n   b) HTML fragments not within <html> tags. \n   c) Text with RTF tags.\n2. Set up a dynamic text element to display the content of this field.\n3. Observe the output and verify if the dynamic text element applies the correct content type formatting. If any discrepancy is noticed, document the details for further investigation."}
