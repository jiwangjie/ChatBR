{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog fails to persist filter information. When an XPath expression with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation class is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this manner is prone to causing various issues.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Open the .rptdesign file.\n6. Verify that the filter information stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
