{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation class, which is responsible for persistence, saves to the .rptdesign file but does not save the data stored in the filterInfo. As a result, the filter information is lost.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Verify that the data stored in the filterInfo is not persisted in the .rptdesign file."}
