{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior leads to trouble if XPath expressions are treated this way.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
