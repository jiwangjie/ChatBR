Some suggested improvements are to perform duplicated name validation on the first page, merge the first and second columns, address the issue of small buttons, ensure a table entry is selected when the dialog comes up, enable both move buttons, handle long param names without the preview being cut off, and optimize the dialog size for methods with many parameters.", "OB": "a. The buttons in the Modify Parameters dialog are too small. b. When the dialog is opened, there is no selected entry in the table. However, both move buttons are enabled. c. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off. d. The dialog appears excessively large for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The buttons in the Modify Parameters dialog should have a larger size. b. When the dialog is opened, there should be a selected entry in the table. c. The preview should display the complete name when a parameter name is very long. d. The size of the dialog should be optimized for methods with many parameters.", "SR": ""}
