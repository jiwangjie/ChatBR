It is unclear what this message means and whether it is an error. It is suggested to display the message in red with an error icon if it is indeed an error.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package option, the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should not appear when the package name field is empty. If it is necessary to display a warning message, it should be clearly distinguishable, such as by using a different color or adding an appropriate icon.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the New Package Wizard.\n2. Leave the package name field empty.\n3. Observe the message that appears at the top."}
