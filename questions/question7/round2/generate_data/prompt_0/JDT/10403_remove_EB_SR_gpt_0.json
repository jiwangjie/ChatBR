{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation does not confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation that the output directory (bin directory) can be deleted and rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files. These additional files can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a new project.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure.\n3. Point the output folder to a bin directory.\n4. Verify if there is a confirmation or validation that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
