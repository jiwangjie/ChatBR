{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation does not confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This can lead to issues if the user points the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The project creation process should include a step to confirm that the bin directory can be scrubbed and rebuilt, especially if the user wants to use an existing directory structure as the project base.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new project.\n2. When selecting the output directory, choose a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n3. Proceed with the project creation process.\n4. Observe that there is no confirmation or validation regarding the bin directory and its contents."}
