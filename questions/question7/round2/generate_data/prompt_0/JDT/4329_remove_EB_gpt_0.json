The package view initializes the Search dialog with the fully qualified name, which is not found when searching for declarations. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works as expected.", "EB": "When searching for declarations via the package view selection and dialog, the search should first try to get the Java element. If that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the package view selection and dialog. \n2. Search for declarations. \n3. Observe that no results are returned. \n\nTo verify the expected behavior: \n1. Open the packages view. \n2.
