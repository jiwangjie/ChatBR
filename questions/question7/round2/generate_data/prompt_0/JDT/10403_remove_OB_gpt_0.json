Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory.\n3. Confirm that the bin directory contains files other than .class files.\n4. Attempt to delete the output directory and rebuild it."}
