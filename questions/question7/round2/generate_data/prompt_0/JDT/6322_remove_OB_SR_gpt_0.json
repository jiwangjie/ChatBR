{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322 All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "Bug 6322 All types dialog shows obfuscated classes. JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) etc.", "OB": "The All types dialog shows obfuscated classes in a prominent manner. These classes appear alongside the normal classes and are not differentiated in any way.", "EB": "Obfuscated classes should be less prominent in the All types dialog. They should be visually differentiated from normal classes, making it easier for users to identify and distinguish them.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Launch the application.\n2. Open the All types dialog.\n3. Observe that obfuscated classes are displayed alongside the normal classes without any visual distinction."}
