However, this fully qualified name is not found in the search results. On the other hand, searching via the context menu in the packages view works as expected.", "EB": "The search functionality in the package view selection and dialog should first try to retrieve the Java element based on the fully qualified name. If retrieving the Java element fails, the search dialog should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Open the package view selection and dialog.  \n2. Search for a declaration using the fully qualified name.  \n3. Note that no search results are returned.  \n4. Alternatively, search for the same declaration using the context menu in the packages view and verify that search results are displayed correctly."}
