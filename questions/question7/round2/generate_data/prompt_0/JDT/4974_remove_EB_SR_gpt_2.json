{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok after setting the output location and classpath, an error message appears: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. By setting the output location first, it creates an illegal state.", "EB": "The software should treat setting the output location and classpath as a single operation. It should not allow to set the output location without also configuring the classpath in order to prevent illegal states.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the software and navigate to the settings menu.\n2. Set a new output location without configuring the classpath.\n3. Press Ok to save the changes.\n4. Observe the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
