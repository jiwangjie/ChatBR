{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When the user types 'button.dispose', the code assist in the IDE incorrectly suggests 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.", "EB": "The code assist should intelligently suggest 'dispose()' when the user types 'button.dispose'. It should prioritize matching the user's input rather than suggesting unrelated options.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code. \n2. Type 'button.dispose' in the editor. \n3. Observe the code assist suggestions and notice that it incorrectly suggests 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. "}
