I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions based on personal preference. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the Edit (or some other global) menu. \n2. Select some text. \n3. Check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available in the context menu. "}
