", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text. It is unclear how the behavior is specified, but in this scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Additionally, having a stray space in the first line makes it confusing why the text does not shift.", "EB": "When executing the ShiftLeft command on lines with intermixed tabs and spaces should properly shift the lines to the left.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open a default text editor and type in the following lines:\n   - <space>\n   - <tab>some text\n   - <tab>some text2\n2. Select and highlight the two lines mentioned above.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nObserve that nothing moves."}
