The file should not be marked as 'dirtied' if no changes have been made.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a Java file. 2. Place the cursor inside the leftmost parenthesis of a method call. For example, consider 'I' to be the cursor below: Object o = anotherObject.method(I); 3. Press Ctrl+Space to trigger code assist. Note the absence of code assist and the file being marked as 'dirtied' even though it remains unchanged."}
