{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to add an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog immediately closes without honoring the cancellation request. As a result, the exception list is displayed despite the cancellation request.", "EB": "The software should either honor the cancellation request and prevent the exception list from being displayed, or disable the cancel button during the process of adding exception breakpoints. To achieve the latter, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to 'false'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the exception breakpoint settings.\n3. Click on 'Add new exception breakpoint'.\n4. Upon seeing the progress dialog, attempt to cancel the operation.\n5. Notice that the progress dialog closes, but the exception list is still displayed."}
