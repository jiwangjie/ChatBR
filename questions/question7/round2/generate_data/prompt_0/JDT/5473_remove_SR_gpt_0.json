The text does not shift as expected.", "EB": "Upon replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually indent both lines equally, executing ShiftLeft should shift the second line to the left and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character, effectively removing the tab. However, it is unclear from the specification how precisely the behavior should be. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that any stray spaces do not interfere with the text shifting. The behavior should be consistent and clear to the user.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n3. Observe that the text does not shift correctly."}
