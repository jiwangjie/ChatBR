{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with:\nbutton.DISPOSED\nwhich isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time.\nCode assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the code assist feature, when I type 'button.DISPOSED', it is automatically inserted instead of 'button.dispose()', even though 'dispose()' is a closer match to what I want.", "EB": "The code assist feature should recognize the context in which it is being used and suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' in situations where it is a more appropriate match.", "SR": "1. Open the application\n2. Start writing SWT code\n3. Type 'button.dispose' and observe the code assist dropdown\n4. Note that 'DISPOSED' is suggested instead of 'dispose()'\n5. Delete the incorrect suggestion and manually type 'dispose()'"}
