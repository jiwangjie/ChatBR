Consider the enclosed class.\nAs a programmer, I must add a parameter to the baz call in bar to make the program correct.\n\nSteps:\n1. UI can decide whether it wants to use the code assist end position (until the end of the current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, so as to control the amount of source to replace.\n2. Removing code assist option.\n\nKUM (5/21/01 9:02:11 AM)\n\nThe text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure. Moved to ITPJCORE.\n\nPM (9/4/2001 2:58:56 PM)\n\nOption was added.\n\nPM (9/25/2001 2:20:50 PM)\n\nRemoving option.", "OB": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the software consumes more code than expected. In the provided class, the baz call in the bar method needs an additional parameter for the program to be correct. However, the code assist suggests replacing more code than necessary.", "EB": "The code assist feature should only suggest replacing the necessary code for the baz call in the bar method to add an additional parameter without modifying other parts of the code.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Change the baz call to baz(x.x.foo())\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'\n3. Press Ctrl + Space to invoke code assist\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list\n5. Select 'foo()'\n6. Observe the suggested code replacement by the code assist feature."}
