I don't understand it.", "OB": "When hitting F4 on a binary project selection (e.g., org.apache.ant), the system displays the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.'. There are no class hierarchies shown for the internal jars.", "EB": "When hitting F4 on a binary project selection (e.g., org.apache.ant), I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. The message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.' should not appear or should provide more context about why the hierarchies are not shown.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a binary project\n2. Select a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant)\n3. Hit F4"}
