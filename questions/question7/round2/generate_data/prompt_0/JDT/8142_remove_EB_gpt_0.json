I don't understand it.", "OB": "When I hit F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. org.apache.ant), I get the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. BTW, what does the message mean?", "EB": "When I hit F4 on a binary project selection, I should see the class hierarchies of the internal jars instead of getting the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of [package]'. I would also like a clearer explanation of the message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a binary project. 2. Select a package (e.g. org.apache.ant). 3. Hit F4."}
