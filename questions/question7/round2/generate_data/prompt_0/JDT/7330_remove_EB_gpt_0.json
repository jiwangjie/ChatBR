I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal preference, which should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "When selecting text, the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be available in the context menu when selecting text. Users should not be required to switch to the Outline view to access this action.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select text in the editor and right-click to open the context menu. Note that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not listed. The expected behavior is for the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be present in the context menu when text is selected."}
