This message is displayed even when the package name field is empty. The user is confused about the meaning of this message and whether it is an error. It is noted in the bug report that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Additionally, the bug report mentions the need to create a default package, but the user is unsure about how to do this since it always exists and cannot be created by the user.", "EB": "The message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should not be displayed when the package name field is empty. If an error occurs, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. The 'Finish' button should be disabled when the package name field is empty. A clear way to create a default package should be provided to the user.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Invoke the 'New Java Package' feature.\n2. Note that the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed at the top, even when the package name field is empty.\n3. Attempt to create a default package, if applicable, and observe the user experience and available options."}
