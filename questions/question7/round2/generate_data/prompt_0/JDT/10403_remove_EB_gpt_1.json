{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a prompt or notification to confirm the deletion and rebuilding of the output directory. This confirmation will help prevent users from mistakenly pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains files other than .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory.\n3. Verify that there is no confirmation or message to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt.\n4. Confirm that the output directory contains files other than .class files that cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files."}
