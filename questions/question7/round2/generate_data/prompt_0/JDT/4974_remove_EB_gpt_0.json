{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, an error message appears: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as separate operations, and setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "When changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, there should not be an error message regarding nesting output folders in the source folder. The system should handle the classpath and output location settings in a single operation to avoid creating an illegal state.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Go to the project properties. \n3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location. \n4. Press 'Ok' to save the changes."}
