{"id": "6536", "title": "Bug 6536 - Add Javadoc on field in TH does nothing", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to add Javadoc on a field in TH (presumably an IDE or code editor), selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu does not result in any action or behavior. Nothing happens when the option is chosen.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu should add Javadoc documentation to the selected field. Alternatively, if the functionality is not intended to be supported, the 'Add Javadoc' option should be removed from the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the TH in an IDE or code editor. 2. Right-click on a field. 3. From the context menu, select the 'Add Javadoc' option."}
