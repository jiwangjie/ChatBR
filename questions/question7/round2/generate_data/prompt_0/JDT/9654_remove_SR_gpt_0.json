The buttons are too small.\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\nd. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\nb. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\nc. Multiple selection should be allowed, as 'move up'/'move down' can be applied on more than one item.\nd. The signature preview must be a label that wraps.\ne. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\na. Open the 'Modify Parameters' dialog.\nb. Observe the size of the buttons.\nc. Note that no table entry is selected when the dialog comes up.\nd. Try changing a parameter name to a very long one and observe the preview.\ne. Test the dialog with methods that have many parameters and observe the size of the dialog.\nf. Attempt to perform multiple selections in the table.\ng. Test the 'move up' and 'move down' functionality on multiple selected items.\nh. Check the behavior of the signature preview and hover effect."}
