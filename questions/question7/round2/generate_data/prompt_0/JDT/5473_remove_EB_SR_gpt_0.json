{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character is replaced with spaces in the first line so that both lines are visually indented the same, and ShiftLeft is executed, the text moves. In this scenario, it seems that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). However, it is confusing as to why the text does not shift, especially when there is a stray space present.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when ShiftLeft is executed, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character (if present). The text should not have any stray spaces and the shift should be visually consistent with the indentation of the line.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute ShiftLeft and observe the behavior of the text shifting."}
