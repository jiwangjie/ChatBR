Nothing happens when the function is executed.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when executing ShiftLeft with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text should be shifted left. The second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). There should not be any stray space that prevents the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following lines:\n   - a space\n   - a tab\n   - some text\n   - a tab\n   - some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines mentioned above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft function.\n\nNotice that nothing happens, and the text does not shift."}
