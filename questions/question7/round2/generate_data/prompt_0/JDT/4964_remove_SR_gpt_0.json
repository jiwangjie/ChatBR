{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist list appears. However, without realizing this, I continue typing and the code assist inserts whatever is currently selected.", "EB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, it should recognize that I have typed a '(' character and prioritize the suggestion 'dispose()' over 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, the code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Start writing SWT code \n2. Type 'button.dispose' \n3. Without looking at the code assist list, continue typing '(' \n4. Observe that the code assist inserts the current selection instead of the expected suggestion 'dispose()'"}
