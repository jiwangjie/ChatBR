{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation fails to confirm the ability to scrub the bin directory", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we fail to confirm that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This issue is particularly problematic when users point the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files. These additional files cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files and cause the project creation process to fail.", "EB": "We should add a confirmation step during project creation to ensure that the output directory can be successfully deleted and rebuilt. This step should account for cases where the bin directory contains files that cannot be regenerated from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the application\n2. Navigate to the project creation screen\n3. Choose an existing directory structure as the project location\n4. Specify a bin directory containing non-regenerable files as the output folder\n5. Attempt to create the project\n\nExpected result:\nThe system should display a confirmation prompt verifying that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
