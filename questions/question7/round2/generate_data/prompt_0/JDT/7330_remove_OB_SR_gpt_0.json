I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not (not all need to be in the context menu but all must be reachable from the editor, e.g., it is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.)", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the Edit menu or any other global menu. It is only accessible from the Outline view.", "EB": "I expected the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" to be available in the Edit menu (or some other global menu).", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Navigate to the Edit menu or any other global menu and check if the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is available.\n4. Switch to the Outline view and check if the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is available there."}
