However, the exception list still appears even if the cancellation request was made. It should either honor the cancellation request and prevent the exception list from appearing, or disable the cancel button in the progress dialog. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to false.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the exception breakpoint settings.\n3. Click on the 'Add' button to add a new exception breakpoint.\n4. Observe that the progress dialog closes immediately.\n5.
