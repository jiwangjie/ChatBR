When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\nOnly types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\nDestination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "The browse button is too small.\nTitle is used for long text.\nWhen going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\nOnly types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\nDestination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "The browse button should be of standard size (using SWTUtil for standard button sizes).\nThe title should not be used for long text on the next page.\nWhen going to the next page, it should not display 'Type not found'.\nOnly types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\nDestination type should not be the same as the source type to avoid false refactoring warnings and pseudo changes in referencing classes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the dialog.\n2. Observe that the browse button is too small.\n3. Observe that the title is used for long text on the next page.\n4.

Validate if the destination type can be the same as the source type and if there are any refactoring warnings or pseudo changes in referencing classes."}
