{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, the software does not confirm whether the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt. As a result, some users are encountering issues because the bin directory contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The software should confirm whether the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt during project creation for an existing directory structure. This confirmation should include checking the contents of the bin directory to ensure that only .class files need to be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. When prompted, point the output folder at a bin directory.\n3. Proceed with project creation.\n4. Observe that the software does not confirm whether the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
