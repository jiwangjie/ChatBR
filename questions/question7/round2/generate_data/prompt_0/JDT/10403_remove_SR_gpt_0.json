Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project, the software should confirm that the bin directory can be scrubbed (deleted and rebuilt) as part of the project creation process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory that contains additional files besides .class files. \n3.
