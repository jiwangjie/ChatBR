{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, the selected suggestion does not match the desired code. Instead of suggesting \"dispose()\", it suggests \"DISPOSED\". This results in the inserted code being incorrect and requires manual deletion and correction.", "EB": "The automatic code assist feature should be smarter in determining the appropriate suggestions based on context. It should prioritize suggesting \"dispose()\" when a closing parenthesis is typed, instead of suggesting unrelated options like \"DISPOSED\". Additionally, the code assist should consider case sensitivity when automatically inserting code snippets.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing a method call which includes opening and closing parentheses.\n3. Observe the suggestions provided by the automatic code assist feature.\n4. Select a suggestion that is not the desired code.\n5. Note the inserted code and compare it to the expected code.\n6. Delete the incorrect code and start again."}
