In this case, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). There should not be any confusion or unexpected behavior when a stray space is present.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nThe text should not move as expected, causing confusion when a stray space is present. The expected behavior is to have the second line shifted left and the first line shifted left at least to the space character."}
