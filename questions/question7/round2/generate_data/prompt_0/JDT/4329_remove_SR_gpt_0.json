The package view initializes the Search dialog with the fully qualified name, which is not found in the search results. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works as expected.", "EB": "When searching for declarations via the package view selection and dialog, the search should first try to get the Java element. If that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the package view \n2. Select a package \n3. Open the search dialog \n4. Enter a search query for declarations \n5. Click on the search button \n6. Observe that no results are displayed"}
