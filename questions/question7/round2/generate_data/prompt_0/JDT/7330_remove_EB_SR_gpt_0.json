I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, it is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without forcing users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is missing from the context menu for text selection. It is only available when switching to the Outline view.", "EB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be available in the context menu for text selection in the Editor view.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the editor and select some text. 2. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu. Expected: The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be visible in the context menu. Actual: The action is missing from the context menu. Switching to the Outline view makes the action available."}
