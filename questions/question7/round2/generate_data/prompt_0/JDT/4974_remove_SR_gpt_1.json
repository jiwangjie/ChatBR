{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after setting the output location and classpath, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This indicates that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, leading to an illegal state.", "EB": "The validation process should be updated to check both the classpath and output location simultaneously. Additionally, the setting of the classpath and output location should be offered as one operation to prevent the creation of an illegal state. It is worth noting that the error message wording should be improved. A more appropriate message could be: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Go to the settings menu.\n3. Set the output location to '/xy' and the classpath to '/xy/src'.\n4. Click 'Ok'.\n5. Observe the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
