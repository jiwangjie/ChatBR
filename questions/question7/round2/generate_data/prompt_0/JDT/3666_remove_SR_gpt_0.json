{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: Code Completion Hungry Code Assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances code assist eats too much code.\nConsider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the baz call in bar to make the program correct.\nSteps to reproduce: \n1. Modify the class as shown in the expected behavior section.\n2. Use code assist feature to add a parameter to the baz call in the bar method.\n\nExpected behavior: \nThe code is changed to: \nbaz(x.foo().foo())\nI would rather it gave me \nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n   void bar(X x) {\n      baz(x.foo());\n   }\n\n   int foo() {\n      return 5;\n   }\n\n   void baz(int i, int j) {\n   }\n}", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me\n\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n\n   void bar(X x) {\n      baz(x.foo());\n   }\n\n   int foo() {\n      return 5;\n   }\n\n   void baz(int i, int j) {\n   }\n}", "EB": "The code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me\n\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n\n   void bar(X x) {\n      baz(x.foo());\n   }\n\n   int foo() {\n      return 5;\n   }\n\n   void baz(int i, int j) {\n   }\n}\n\nThe choice amongst one or the other should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).", "SR": "1.
