{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature eats too much code. For example, when adding a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method of the provided class, the code assist replaces more code than expected.", "OB": "The observed behavior is that the code is changed to 'baz(x.foo()x.foo())' instead of 'baz(x.foo());'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code assist should only replace the code inside the method call, without removing any other part of the line of code.", "SR": "Follow these steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the provided class.\n2. Inside the 'baz' method call in the 'bar' method, try to add a new parameter.\n3. Observe how the code assist replaces more code than expected."}
