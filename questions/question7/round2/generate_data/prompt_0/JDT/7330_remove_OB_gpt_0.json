I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available when selecting text in the editor.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the context menu or the Edit menu when selecting text in the editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Select text in the editor. \n2. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu. \n3. Look for the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' in the context menu. \n4. If it is not present, switch to the Outline view and repeat steps 1-3."}
