I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, it seems that the actions are distributed based on personal taste, and this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available on text selection. It is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not.", "EB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be available on text selection. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without the need to switch views.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the editor. 2. Select some text. 3. Open the Edit menu and look for the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action. It should not be available there. 4. Switch to the Outline view and check if the action is available there."}
