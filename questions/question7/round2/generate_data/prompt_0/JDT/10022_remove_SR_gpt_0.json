This behavior is incorrect.", "EB": "The 'Build' option should only appear in the popup menu if the build needs to be performed manually. If the user has selected the automatic build option, the 'Build' option should not be available in the popup menu.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the Java perspective.\n2. Go to the Preferences Workbench.\n3. Select 'Perform build automatically on resource modification'.\n4. Open the context-sensitive popup menu.\n5. Verify that the 'Build' option is still available in the menu, even though it should not be."}
