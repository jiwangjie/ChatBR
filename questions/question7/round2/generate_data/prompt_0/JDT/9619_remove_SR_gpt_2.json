Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g. ", "OB": "1. Browse button is too small and should use SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\n2. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\n3. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\n4. Destination type can be source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'.\n2. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the static member dialog.\n2. Navigate to the type field.\n3. Observe that there is no validation on the type field.\n4. Try entering a different type.\n5. Notice that the label does not display 'Select destination type:'.\n6. Verify that the destination type can be the same as the source type and check if the refactoring warns about errors and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes."}
