{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: 'DISPOSED' and 'int Widgetdispose() void Widget'. I then type '(', but as soon as I type the '(', the automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "OB": "Build 204 - When typing 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist inserts undesired text 'DISPOSED'.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting text.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the SWT code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Type '(' after 'dispose'.\n4. Observe the automatic code assist inserting text that does not match the expected 'dispose()'."}
