Currently, there are no non-static methods in this class, so adding a private constructor would be a good thing to ensure that the class is not instantiated unnecessarily. This change would not increase the size of the class since the compiler provides a free public constructor by default. Instead, it would make the constructor private.", "SR": "To address this issue, please modify the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), 'windowProc', 4); Although this change has not been tested, it is expected to have the same effect."}
