{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace functionality is behaving in an unexpected manner. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog, the software searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds a match, it replaces the user's typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios. The software should not automatically replace the user's typed entry with a value from the history.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. In the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...), there is a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software performs a search within the history and replaces the user's typed entry with a matching value from the history. The search is case insensitive, resulting in changes to the case of the user's typed entry. This behavior interferes with find and replace operations.", "EB": "The software should not replace the user's typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to input their desired search or replacement text without automatic changes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by selecting Edit > Find/Replace... 2. Type a specific value (e.g., 'hello') in the 'Find' field. 3. Perform a find operation by clicking 'Find'. 4. Attempt to type a different value (e.g., 'Hello') in the 'Find' field. The software should not automatically replace the user's input with a value from the history."}
