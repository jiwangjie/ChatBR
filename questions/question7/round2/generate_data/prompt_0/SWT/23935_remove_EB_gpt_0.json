{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text widget does not lose focus when clicking on the tree because the text widget is a child of the tree. This behavior causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree should gain focus. On Linux, the text widget should lose focus when clicking on the tree. This behavior should be consistent across platforms and not cause any bugs in the platform UI.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the application. 2. Click anywhere in the tree widget."}
