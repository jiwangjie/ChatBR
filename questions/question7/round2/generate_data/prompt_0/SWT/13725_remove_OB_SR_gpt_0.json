Open a file in the java editor. \n2. Make some changes to the file. \n3. Try to revert the file using the revert option. \n4. Observe that reverting the file takes longer than expected. \n5. Close the file and reopen it. \n6. Observe that closing and reopening the file is faster than reverting it."}
