{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and automatically suggests options from the search history.", "EB": "The behavior of the Find/Replace feature should be changed so that it allows users to fully perform find and replace operations without automatically replacing the typed entry with a value from the history. The feature should still respect the case sensitivity of user input. Alternatively, the feature could be temporarily removed until the desired behavior is implemented.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a document to make the 'Edit' menu visible.\n2. Choose 'Edit' followed by 'Find/Replace...'\n3. Try to type a character 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n4. Click 'Find'.\n5. Attempt to type a capital 'A' into the 'Find' field again."}
