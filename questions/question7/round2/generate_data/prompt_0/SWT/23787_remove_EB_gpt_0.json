Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not have text fields with automatic borders on motif platforms. The fields in all platforms should have consistent appearances.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Select a Project \n2. Right-click and choose Properties\n3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (e.g., Path, Type)"}
