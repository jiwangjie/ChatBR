{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete,' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace functionality, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. It should allow the user to perform a full range of find and replace operations while respecting the case of the user's input. In the meantime, the feature should be removed from the software.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Access the Edit menu and click on Find/Replace...\n3. Observe that the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Perform a find and replace operation.\n5. Note that the behavior is similar for the 'Replace With' field as well."}
