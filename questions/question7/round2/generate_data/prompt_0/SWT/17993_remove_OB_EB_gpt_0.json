{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The software should not replace what is being typed with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to type freely without interference from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Choose 'Edit' > 'Find/Replace...'\n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field\n3. Click 'Find'\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field"}
