{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature in the F1 build is replacing the typed entry with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, but it can cause issues when performing find or replace operations. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered. ", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. In the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...), the history of recent searches is being used to auto-populate the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields as you type. If a matching entry is found in the history, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow users to explicitly select a value from the history if desired. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Find/Replace dialog (Edit > Find/Replace...) 2. Observe that the 'Find' and 'Replace With' fields are auto-populated with entries from the history as you type. 3. Try to perform a find or replace operation and observe that the typed entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history, making it impossible to perform the intended operation. "}
