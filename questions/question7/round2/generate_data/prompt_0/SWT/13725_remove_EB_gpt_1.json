{"id": "13725", "title": "Bug 13725: Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "description": "Bug 13725: Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "OB": "When performing the following steps: 1) clicking on the close box in the editor tab, 2) answering 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, and 3) double-clicking on the file in the navigator to reopen it, the contents of the window are replaced with the original file. However, this process takes about 8 seconds. In the same scenario, if I select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file.", "EB": "The process of reverting a file should be as fast as or faster than closing and reopening the file in the java editor. The time taken to revert the file should not exceed 8 seconds in the described scenario.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. 2) Mark the file as dirty by selecting the end of the first line and inputting a space character. 3) Close the editor by clicking on the close box in the editor tab. 4) When prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, select 'no'. 5) Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. Observe the time taken for the contents of the window to be replaced with the original file. Repeat steps 1-5, and instead of reopening the file, right-click on the editor and select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu. Observe the time taken to revert the file."}
