However, moving them around has no effect. Even when opening a small image like an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they don't do anything.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled so that users understand that they are not functional and are not necessary for navigating small images.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.2.10 (GTK2 only). 2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example. 3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled. 4. Attempt to move the scrollbars and notice that they don't have any effect. 5. Open a small image, such as an icon, and observe that the scrollbars are misleading."}
