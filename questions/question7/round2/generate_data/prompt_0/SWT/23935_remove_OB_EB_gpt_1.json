We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When the user clicks anywhere in the tree, the tree retains the focus.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when the user clicks anywhere in the tree.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, click anywhere in the tree and observe that the tree retains the focus."}
