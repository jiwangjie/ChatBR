{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when clicking on the tree. This behavior is causing platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Launch the application with both the tree and the text widget.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gains focus, but the text widget does not lose focus."}
