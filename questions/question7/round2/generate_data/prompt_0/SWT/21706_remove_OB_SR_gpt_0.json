Since there are no non-static methods in this class, it is unnecessary to allow instantiation of the class.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the source code for the BidiUtil class in the win32 implementation.\n2. Look for the usage of Class.forName() in the code.\n3. Verify that there are no non-static methods in the class.\n4. Ensure that the constructor of the BidiUtil class is public.\n5. Modify the code to remove the usage of Class.forName() and make the constructor private.\n6. Compile and test the modified code to verify that it works as expected."}
