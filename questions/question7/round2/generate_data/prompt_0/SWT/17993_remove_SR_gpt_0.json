{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from previous searches. If a matching entry is found, it replaces the user's typed entry with the value from the history. The search is case-insensitive, which means the case of the user's input may be changed to match the value in the history. This behavior can prevent certain find or replace operations from being performed.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build, if a matching entry is found in the history, the software replaces the user's typed entry with the value from the history. This occurs even if the user's input has different case than the value in the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build should not replace the user's typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to perform all find and replace operations while respecting the case of the user's input. Until this behavior is changed, it may be preferable to remove the feature altogether.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document to make the Edit>Find/Replace... option available. 2. Open the Find/Replace dialog. 3. Type something in the 'Find' field. 4. Observe that if a matching entry is found in the history, the user's typed entry is replaced with the value from the history. The same behavior may be observed in the 'Replace With' field."}
