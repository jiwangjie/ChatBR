{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "In the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect. When opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading as they do not perform any function.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled when opening small images, such as icons, as they do not provide any useful functionality in this case.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. View a small image, such as an icon.\n3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but have no effect."}
