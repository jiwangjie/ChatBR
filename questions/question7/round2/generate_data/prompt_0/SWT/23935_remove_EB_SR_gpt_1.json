{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when clicking on the tree, regardless of the platform. The text widget should not be a child of the tree to prevent platform UI bug 2470.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Create a tree with a text widget child. 2. Click anywhere in the tree. 3. Note that the tree gets focus and the text widget does not lose focus."}
