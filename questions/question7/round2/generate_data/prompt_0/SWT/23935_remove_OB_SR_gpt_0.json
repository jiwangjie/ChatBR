{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the attached code, the text widget with tree parent does not lose focus on Windows.", "EB": "In build 20020920, the left tree and text should behave as they should on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the attached code and observe that the text widget with tree parent does not lose focus on Windows."}
