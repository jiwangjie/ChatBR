{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the tree and text widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. It is suggested that we can work around this issue by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree retains the focus and does not lose it.", "EB": "When running build 20020920, the left tree and text should behave as expected on both Windows and Linux, meaning that when clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree should not retain the focus.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run build 20020920.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree retains the focus instead of losing it."}
