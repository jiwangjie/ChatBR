This code throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. As a result, there is an issue in the CLDC version of SWT. This problem can only be observed if jxeLink or a similar tool is used, as the compiler automatically generates the call and assumes NoClassDefFoundError is available.", "EB": "The usage of `Class.forName()` in BidiUtil should be changed to remove the reflection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, verify or use jxeLink (or a similar tool) with the CLDC version of SWT."}
