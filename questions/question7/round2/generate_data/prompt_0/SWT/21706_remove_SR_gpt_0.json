The BidiUtil.class uses Class.forName('org...BidiUtil') which causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT when using jxeLink or similar verification methods. It does not produce a compiler error.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to change the code by adding a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. This change will prevent the instantiation of the class when it is unnecessary. It will not increase the size of the code since the compiler provides a default public constructor. Making the constructor private will be a good improvement.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps: \n\n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT. \n2. Compile the code that contains the line 'static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, 'windowProc', 4);'. \n3. Verify the code using jxeLink or a similar method. \n4. Observe the NoClassDefFoundError caused by the Class.forName('org...BidiUtil') usage."}
