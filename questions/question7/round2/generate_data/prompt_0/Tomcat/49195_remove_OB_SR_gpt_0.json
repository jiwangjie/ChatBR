{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port='1' in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with Windows service, the software works without any issues but prints an error message.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use the interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Specify <Server port='1' in the server.xml configuration file.\n2. Start the Windows service.\n3. Observe that the software functions correctly but shows an error message related to the shutdown port when stopping the service."}
