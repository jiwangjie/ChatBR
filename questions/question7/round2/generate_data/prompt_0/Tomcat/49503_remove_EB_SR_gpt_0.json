Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\nTo reproduce:\n1. The first instance starts successfully.\n[1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html\nDowngrading user when running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80).\nI do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.\n3. Actual behaviour:\nThe exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called.\nThe startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "The connector does not bind to the port during Catalina.load(), only when start() is called. This causes the startup sequence to continue but fail in Server.await().", "EB": "The connector should bind to the port during Catalina.load(), before the start() method is called. This will ensure proper functioning of the startup sequence and avoid failure in Server.await().", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Start the first instance of Tomcat.\n2. Run Tomcat with jsvc to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80).\n3. Test the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625.\n4. Start a second instance of Tomcat and observe the unexpected failure in the startup sequence."}
