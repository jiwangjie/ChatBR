{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 incorrect documentation on custom cookie names and URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL, provided that URL rewriting has been enabled. However, when testing this behavior by accessing a page with a custom session cookie name, the actual result is different.", "OB": "When accessing the page using the custom session cookie name, the Set-Cookie header contains the custom session cookie name followed by the session ID. However, the Reload link on the page uses the default 'jsessionid' instead of the custom session cookie name in the URL.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL, as stated in Servlet 3.0 specification.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file.\n2. Access 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'.\n3. Observe the session cookie name in the Set-Cookie header and the URL of the Reload link on the page."}
