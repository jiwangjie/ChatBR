However, the shutdown process still works. It has been observed that using System.exit(0) would work regardless of the shutdown port configuration. It is also suspected that jsvc may exhibit a similar behavior, although this has not been tested.", "OB": "When stopping the Tomcat service on Windows with port 1 specified as the shutdown port in server.xml, an error message is displayed.", "EB": "The error message should not be displayed when stopping the Tomcat service with port 1 specified as the shutdown port. The shutdown process should proceed without any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
