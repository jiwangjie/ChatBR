{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When the Tomcat server is stopped as a Windows service, it prints an error message even though it is able to shut down successfully.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service, and then stop the service. 3. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling Catalina.stop()."}
