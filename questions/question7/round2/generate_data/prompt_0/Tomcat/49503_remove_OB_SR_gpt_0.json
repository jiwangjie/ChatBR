Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "The Connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method.", "EB": "I would expect that in the StandardService.initInternal() method, the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there, and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Start an instance of Tomcat and observe that the Connectors do not bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() method."}
