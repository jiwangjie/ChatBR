{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify `<Server port=\"1\"` in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. `System.exit(0)` would work regardless of all that. I suppose that `jsvc` may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Despite this error message, Tomcat actually stops after printing it. This behavior can be observed because after printing the message, `Catalina.stopServer()` performs `System.exit(1)` which results in Tomcat shutdown. However, it is worth noting that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, `Catalina.server` is not null.", "EB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, the error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' should not be printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. The absence of a shutdown port should not prevent the server from being shut down.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal by calling `Catalina.stop()`."}
