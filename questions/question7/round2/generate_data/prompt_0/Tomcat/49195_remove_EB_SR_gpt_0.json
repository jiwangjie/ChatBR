{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message states 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite the error message, Tomcat stops successfully. After printing the error message, the Catalina stopServer() function performs System.exit(1) which results in the shutdown of Tomcat. It is worth noting that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, follow these steps:\n1. Edit the server.xml file.\n2. Add the following line: <Server port=\"1\"/>\n3. Start the Windows service for Tomcat.\n4. Check the catalina.20100427.log file for the error message stating 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'\n5. Verify that Tomcat stops despite the error message."}
