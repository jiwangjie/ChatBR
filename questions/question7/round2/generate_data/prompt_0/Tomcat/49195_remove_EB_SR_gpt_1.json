{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port='1' in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat stops successfully but prints the following error message in catalina.20100427.log: 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Despite the error message being displayed, Tomcat is still shutdown properly. After printing the error message, the Catalina stopServer() function performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat being shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Specify <Server port='1' in the server.xml configuration file.\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service.\n3. Observe the message in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'\n4. Confirm that Tomcat is still successfully shutdown despite the error message.\n5. Check if the Catalina server is not null when the service launcher stops Tomcat."}
