However, the observed behavior is that even though a custom cookie name (MYSESSIONCOOKIE) is set, the page sends a cookie with a different name (JSESSIONID).", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a custom name is configured for session tracking cookies in a web application and URL rewriting is enabled, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter in the URL.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Set a custom name for the session tracking cookies in a web application.\n2. Ensure that URL rewriting is enabled.\n3. Load the web application and access a page.\n4. Observe the name of the sent cookie and the URL used for reloading the page."}
