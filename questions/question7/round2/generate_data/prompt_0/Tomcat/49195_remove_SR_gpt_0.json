The message states 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, after printing this message, Tomcat stops successfully. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file stating 'No shutdown port configured.

Specify <Server port='1'> in the server.xml file. \n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service. \n3. Stop the Tomcat Windows service. \n4. Check the catalina.20100427.log file for the error message."}
