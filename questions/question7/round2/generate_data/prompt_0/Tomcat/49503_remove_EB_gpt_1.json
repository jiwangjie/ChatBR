{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load() but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "When starting two instances of Tomcat with the same configuration at the same time, the connector does not bind to their ports immediately in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). This issue affects the ability to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80) when running with jsvc. The second instance fails to start as expected, but not in the expected way. Instead of throwing an exception, the connector does not attempt to bind to the port. The startup sequence then continues but eventually fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load() instead of later in start(). This will allow Tomcat to successfully bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80) when running with jsvc. The second instance should throw an exception when it fails to bind to the port, rather than silently continuing the startup sequence and eventually failing in Server.await().", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties:\n   org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
