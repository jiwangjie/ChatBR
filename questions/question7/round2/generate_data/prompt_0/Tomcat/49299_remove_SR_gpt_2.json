However, when testing with the provided attachment 25442 [details]cookiename.war, the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the expected custom cookie name.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'Reload' link should use the custom cookie name in the URL, resulting in a URL like 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F'. This is in line with the statement in chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf documentation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Deploy the attachment 25442 [details]cookiename.war. \n2. Access the webpage using the provided URL. \n3. Observe that the cookie sent by the page has the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE'. \n4. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page. \n5. Observe that the URL generated for the 'Reload' link includes 'jsessionid' instead of the expected custom cookie name."}
