{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it should not search for entries from a previous search. Instead, it should only consider the text that you have typed. The search of the history should not affect the text you have entered in these fields. This will allow users to perform find or replace operations without interference from the history.", "SR": "1. Launch the F1 build.\n2. Open the Find/Replace dialog by selecting Edit > Find/Replace...\n3. Note the history of recent searches in this dialog.\n4. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n5. Click 'Find'.\n6. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."}
