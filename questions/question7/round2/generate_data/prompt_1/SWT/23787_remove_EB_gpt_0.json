Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, which make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should not have automatic borders on motif platforms. The fields should also have the same background color on all platforms.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select a Project and right-click to open the context menu. Then, click on Properties and navigate to the subsequent Info page. The readonly fields (such as Path, Type, etc.) should have text fields with automatic borders and different colored backgrounds on motif platforms."}
