{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. However, on Linux, the text never loses focus when clicking on the tree. This is because the text widget is a child of the tree, which causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When running the code (build 20020920), the left tree and text behave correctly on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the attached code.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree widget.\n3. Observe that the tree gains focus and the text does not lose focus (only on Linux).\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The tree should not gain focus when clicking on it.\n- The text should lose focus when clicking on the tree, similar to Windows behavior."}
