This transition should not take significantly longer when selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu.", "SR": "1) Start by opening an editor on the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. 2) Now, select the end of the first line, and hit a space character so that the file has been marked dirty. From this point, it should take about 8 seconds to perform the following steps: click on the close box in the editor tab, answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, and double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. However, if I repeat steps 1) and 2), and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it should not take significantly longer than 8 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original."}
