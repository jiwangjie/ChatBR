{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "description": "When attempting to revert a file in the java editor, the process is significantly slower compared to closing and reopening the file. \n\nTo reproduce this issue: \n\n1. Make changes to a file in the java editor. \n2. Select 'no' when prompted to save the changes upon closing the file. \n3. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. \n\nExpected Behavior: \n\nThe file should reopen quickly, similar to the time it takes to close and reopen the file. \n\nObserved Behavior: \n\nHowever, if the following steps are repeated: \n\n1. Make changes to a file in the java editor. \n2. Select 'no' when prompted to save the changes upon closing the file. \n3. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. \n4. Select 'Revert' from the context menu in the editor. \n\nIt takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original. This seems odd, as reverting the file contents should not take significantly longer than closing and reopening the file."}
