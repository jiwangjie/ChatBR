{"id": "23935", "title": "Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the text widget and tree widget are children of the shell. The issue occurs only on Windows. A possible workaround is to create the text editor as a sibling of the tree and move it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree widget gains focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when clicking on the tree. It should be noted that the text widget is a child of the tree, which causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the text widget should lose focus when clicking on the tree, regardless of the platform.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a shell window.\n2. Add a tree widget and a text widget as children of the shell.\n3. Click anywhere in the tree.\n4. Observe that the tree widget gains focus but the text widget does not lose focus."}
