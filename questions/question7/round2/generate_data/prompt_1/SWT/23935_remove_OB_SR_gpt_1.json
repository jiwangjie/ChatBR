{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the code with build 20020920, the text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus on Windows.", "EB": "When running the code with build 20020920, the left tree and text should behave as they do on Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Compile and run the attached code with build 20020920.\n2. Observe the behavior of the text widget with Tree parent on Windows."}
