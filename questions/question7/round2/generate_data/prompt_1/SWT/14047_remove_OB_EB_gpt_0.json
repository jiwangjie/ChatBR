Enable word wrap in the StyledText component.\n2. Perform a text change that affects multiple lines.\n3. While the text change is happening, add the following line of code to the `performPaint` method of the StyledText component: `System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);`\n4. Observe the console output to see the number of redraws occurring during the text change."}
