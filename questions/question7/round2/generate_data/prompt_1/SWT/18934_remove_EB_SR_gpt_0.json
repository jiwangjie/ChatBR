{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars enabled but non-functional in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "In Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2.10 (GTK2 only), when opening the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars appear to be enabled and movable. However, they do not have any effect when interacted with. For instance, when opening a small image such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading as they do not perform any scrolling action.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled and not movable when the image does not require scrolling.", "SR": "1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example. \n2. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved. \n3. Load a small image, such as an icon. \n4. Verify that the scrollbars do not have any effect when interacted with."}
