{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build is that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from the previous search history. If it finds a match, it replaces what was typed with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is common in browsers. However, it would be better if what is typed is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered. Currently, this behavior can make it difficult to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "OB": "When using the F1 build and accessing the Find/Replace dialog through Edit > Find/Replace..., the history of recent searches is available. Typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields triggers a search for entries from the previous search history. If a match is found, the currently typed entry is replaced with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, meaning the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "It is expected that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history. The user's input should remain as is without any alterations from the search history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:1. Open the F1 build of the software.2. Go to Edit > Find/Replace... to access the Find/Replace dialog.3. Observe the history of recent searches available.4. Type a new entry in either the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.5. Verify that the software searches for entries from the previous search history.6. If a match is found, confirm that the typed entry is automatically replaced with the value from the history, potentially changing the case of the typed entry.7. Note any scenarios where this behavior hinders the find or replace operations."}
