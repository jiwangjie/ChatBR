{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "Currently, when you click anywhere in the tree, the tree retains focus.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when you click anywhere in the tree, the tree should not retain focus.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the application where the tree and text editor are both displayed. \n2. Click anywhere in the tree. \nExpected result: The tree should lose focus."}
