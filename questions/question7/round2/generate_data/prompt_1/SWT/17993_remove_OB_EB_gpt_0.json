{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to \"autocomplete\" which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full \"autocomplete\" feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the \"Find\" or \"Replace With\" fields, entries from previous searches are displayed as suggestions.", "EB": "Entries from previous searches should not be displayed as suggestions when typing in the \"Find\" or \"Replace With\" fields.", "SR": "1. Open the application and choose Edit Find/Replace.\n2. Type \"a\" into the Find field.\n3. Click \"Find\".\n4. Try to type \"A\" into the Find field."}
