{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using Find/Replace feature, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "The behavior should be changed to not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. It should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.", "SR": "1. Open a document so that Edit -> Find/Replace... becomes available.\n2. Type some text into the 'Find' field.\n3. Observe that the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Perform various find and replace operations.\n5. Verify that the typed entry is not replaced with a value from the history and the operations can be performed successfully.\n\nThe same steps can be followed for the 'Replace With' field."}
