{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, searching for entries from a previous search appears.", "EB": "The behavior of replacing the typed entry with a value from the history should be changed to allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Alternatively, the feature can be removed. Searching for 'hello' and replacing it with 'hi', then searching for 'Hello' and replacing it with 'Hi' should be possible.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open a document so that 'Edit > Find/Replace...' becomes available.\n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field and observe that it is not possible."}
