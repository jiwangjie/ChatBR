Start with a StyledText widget in word wrap mode.\n2. Append N lines of text to the StyledText.\n3. Observe that each line append triggers a redraw of the entire client area.\n\nTo verify the fix, add the following line to StyledText's performPaint method:\nSystem.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight); Check that the printed output does not show N redraws when appending N lines of text to the StyledText in word wrap mode."}
