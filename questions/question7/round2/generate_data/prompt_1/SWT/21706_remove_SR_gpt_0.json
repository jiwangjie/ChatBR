This causes a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. This issue can only be observed if verified or used jxeLink or something similar as the compiler assumes NoClassDefFoundError is available.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, we should add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it is unnecessary for it to have a public constructor. Making the constructor private would prevent people from instantiating the class unnecessarily, without adding any additional size to the class.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue and verify the fix: \n\n1. Open the BidiUtil class in org.eclipse.swt.internal package. \n2. Locate the line with the static Callback initialization. \n3. Replace the usage of 'new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4)' with a private constructor for BidiUtil. \n4. Recompile the code and run it using CLDC version of SWT. \n5. Verify that the NoClassDefFoundError is no longer thrown."}
