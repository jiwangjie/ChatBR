Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or NotePad as the default editor for all Java files. \n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the Java file opened. Close it. \n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench. \n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. \n\nExpected Behavior: A warning message should be displayed in the workbench informing the user that making changes to the file may overwrite previous changes. The message should also ask if the user wants to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, prompting the user to close all other instances of the file."}
