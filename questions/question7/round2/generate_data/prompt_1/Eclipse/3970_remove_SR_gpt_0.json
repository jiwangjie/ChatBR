The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (as PC are cheaper than Unix boxes).", "OB": "When creating a new file, the current system property line delimiter is used, which may not always be desired by the user.", "EB": "Even if a new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. A UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins to ensure the same line delimiter is used for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check that the default line delimiter for the new file is the system's line delimiter.\n4. Open the Preferences in the Workbench UI.\n5. Locate the option to define the default line delimiter for new files.\n6. Select a line delimiter option, such as Unix.\n7. Create a new file and verify that it now has the selected line delimiter."}
