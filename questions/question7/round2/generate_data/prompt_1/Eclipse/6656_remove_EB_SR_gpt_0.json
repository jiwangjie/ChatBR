{"id": "6656", "title": "Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "On Linux, when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label. This behavior is observed in build 20011127 but not in build 20011116 on Nt2000. This movement of icons could potentially confuse users.", "OB": "The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) move down below the label when the Navigator view is resized smaller on Linux in build 20011127.", "EB": "The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) should remain aligned with the label even when the Navigator view is resized smaller on Linux.", "SR": "1. Launch the application on Linux in build 20011127. \n2. Open the Navigator view. \n3. Resize the view to make it smaller. \n4. Observe the position of the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) in relation to the label."}
