{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734 - System can be shut down without save file warnings", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "The system should provide a 'Do you want to save your file?' dialog box with options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. If 'Cancel' is selected, the shutdown process should be halted. One nice additional feature would be to allow applications to control the shutdown or pop up their own windows that would also allow the user to stop the shutdown.", "SR": ""}
