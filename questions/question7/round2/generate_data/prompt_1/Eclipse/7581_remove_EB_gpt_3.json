", "OB": "When using the ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet, the combo box grows to the width of the largest item. However, if any of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the drop-down button may be positioned too far right and get clipped off the visible area of the property sheet. This prevents the user from seeing the combo drop-down button without widening the property sheet view.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the property sheet view \n2. Use ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet \n3. Populate the combo box with strings that are wider than the column width \n4. Observe that the drop-down button gets clipped off the visible area of the property sheet"}
