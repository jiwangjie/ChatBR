For example, when two projects contain a file named \"foo.txt\", only one \"foo.txt\" file is stored in the zip file.", "EB": "The zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories. In this case, both \"foo.txt\" files from each project should be included in the zip file.", "SR": "1. Create two projects, each containing a file named \"foo.txt\"\n2.
