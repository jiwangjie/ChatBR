It should work the same as the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this is an issue with our implementation or the SWT library.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Select a cell with a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the combo box does not resize to match the width of the property sheet column."}
