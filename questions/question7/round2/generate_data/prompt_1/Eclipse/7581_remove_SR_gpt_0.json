", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet.", "EB": "I would expect the ComboBoxCellEditor to always have the same width as the column in the property sheet. It should work the same as the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. I will investigate further to determine if this is an issue with our implementation or with SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet in the application. \n2. Edit a property that uses ComboBoxCellEditor. \n3. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not have the same width as the column in the property sheet."}
