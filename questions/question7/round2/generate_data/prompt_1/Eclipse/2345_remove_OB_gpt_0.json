Create a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml'.\n3. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'.\n4. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'.\n5. Verify that a new editor for the file 'test.xml' is opened, replacing the current editor if any.\n\nNOTES: The 'scripted resource editor example' is the default editor for XML files, but it ignores the XML file content. The expected behavior is to open a new editor that respects the actual file content."}
