There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure that all plugins use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Use a Unix and Windows workstation to develop a Unix product/program."}
