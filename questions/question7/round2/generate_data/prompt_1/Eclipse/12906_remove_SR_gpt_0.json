Go to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. Nothing happens. The workbench should display a warning message indicating that attempting to open the file may overwrite changes and asks if the user wants to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, stating that the user needs to close the file first. We believe that this is a safety feature implemented in WSAD to prevent external editing while a file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning message displayed when attempting to open the file in another editor.", "SR": "1.
