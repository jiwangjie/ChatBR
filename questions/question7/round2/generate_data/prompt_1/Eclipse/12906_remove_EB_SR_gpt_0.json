Close the currently opened file. \n2. Go to the Java Perspective. \n3. Locate a Java file and double click on it to open it in the workbench. \n4. Now, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. \n5. Observe that nothing happens. \n\nExpected Behavior: \n- The workbench should display a warning message stating that opening the file in another editor may result in the loss of unsaved changes. The message should ask the user if they want to proceed. \n- Alternatively, an error message should be displayed indicating that the user should close all instances of the file before opening it in another editor. \n\nWe believe this is a safety feature in WSAD, where external editing is not allowed while a file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "When trying to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor, a warning message should be displayed informing the user about the potential loss of unsaved changes.

Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. \n5. Verify that a warning message is displayed, indicating the possibility of overwriting changes and asking if the user wants to continue, or an error message is displayed asking the user to close all instances of the file before proceeding."}
