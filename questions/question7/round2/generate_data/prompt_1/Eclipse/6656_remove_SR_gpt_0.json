{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When running build 20011127 on Linux and resizing a view like the Navigator to a smaller size, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label. This behavior is not observed in build 20011116 on Nt2000. The movement of these icons may confuse users.", "EB": "In the previous version, the tool items used to stay on the same line as the label regardless of the view size. However, in the current version, they move down when the view is resized smaller. This change in behavior is likely to cause usability problems because users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located in the far right corner.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Go to the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n4. Observe the position of the tool items (pulldown menu icon and close icon) in relation to the label."}
