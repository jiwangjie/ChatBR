{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects in a property sheet, which displays a set of rows as name-value pairs in two columns, I found that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly. This editor is created using the IPropertyDescriptor, which has a method to create the cell editor. I create editors that include the ComboBoxCellEditor, which allows me to provide a list of strings. The ComboBoxCellEditor is used in column two of the property sheet, and the drop down button is supposed to appear at the right edge of the column. However, if any of the strings provided are wider than the width of the column, the combo box grows to fit the widest string. As a result, the drop down button may be pushed off the visible area of the property sheet, making it impossible for the user to see or access the drop down options without expanding the width of the property sheet.", "OB": "The drop down button of the ComboBoxCellEditor is not visible when any of the strings provided are wider than the width of the property sheet column. The button is pushed off the visible area and clipped.", "EB": "The drop down button of the ComboBoxCellEditor should always be visible, regardless of the width of the strings. It should not be pushed off the visible area or clipped.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the property sheet with columns containing the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n2. Provide a list of strings where at least one string is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n3. Observe that the drop down button is pushed off the visible area and clipped.\n\nExpected result: The drop down button should be visible at all times, even if the width of the strings exceeds the width of the property sheet column."}
