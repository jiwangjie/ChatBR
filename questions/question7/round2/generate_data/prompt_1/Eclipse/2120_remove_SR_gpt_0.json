The observed behavior is that the files do not appear in the File menu MRU list. The expected behavior is that the files should appear in the MRU list and be persisted between sessions. The notes mention that the IPersistableElement should be used and the underlying resource should not be peeked into. It also mentions that the IEditorInput may not be a resource.", "OB": "The files do not appear in the File menu MRU list.", "EB": "The files should appear in the File menu MRU list and be persisted between sessions.", "SR": "1.
