", "OB": "The current behavior is that when creating a new file, the line delimiter used is obtained from the System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\") method. However, this is not always what the user wants.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to provide a user interface that allows users to define the default line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Eclipse.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Note that the line delimiter used is the one returned by System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\").\n4. Verify that there is no user interface option available to define the default line delimiters for new files.\n\nExpected:\n- There should be a UI option available in the preferences/settings to define the default line delimiters for new files.\n\nNote: This issue is particularly relevant for Windows workstations used as X terminals."}
