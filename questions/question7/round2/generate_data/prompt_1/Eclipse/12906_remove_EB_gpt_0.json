Go to the Java Perspective and open a java file by double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' followed by 'System Editor'. Nothing happens. The workbench should display a warning message stating that overwriting changes is not allowed and ask if the user wants to continue, or an error message should be displayed indicating that all files need to be closed first. We believe this is a safety feature where WSAD does not allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "When attempting to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor, the workbench should display an error message indicating that the file cannot be opened in another editor and should be closed first before proceeding.", "SR": "1.
