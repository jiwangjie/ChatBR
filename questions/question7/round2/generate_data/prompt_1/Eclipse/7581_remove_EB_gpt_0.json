{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects with a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns, with each column defined by an IPropertyDescriptor, an issue arises when using the ComboBoxCellEditor constructor with strings. The editor appears in the second column of the property sheet, and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column. The problem occurs when any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. The combo box grows to be the width of the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be pushed off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped. As a result, users cannot see the combo drop-down button unless they make the property sheet view wider until the button becomes visible.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Add a property with a long string value in the second column.\n3. Observe that the combo box grows to the width of the widest item.\n4. Verify that the drop-down button is clipped and not visible.\n\nExpected behavior: The combo box and drop-down button should be properly sized within the property sheet column, allowing users to see and interact with the drop-down button without resizing the property sheet view."}
