", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly. If any string in the dropdown list is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. As a result, the dropdown button may be off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue with sizing of the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet: \n\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer and navigate to the section where ComboBoxCellEditor is used.\n2. Ensure that one or more strings in the dropdown list are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n3. Observe that the combo box grows to match the width of the widest string.\n4. Verify if the dropdown button is now off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped, making it difficult for the user to see and select the options.\n\nExpected Behavior: The ComboBoxCellEditor should size itself correctly so that the dropdown button is always within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the items in the dropdown list."}
