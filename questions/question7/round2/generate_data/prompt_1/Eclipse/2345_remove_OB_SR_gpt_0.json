Create a new basic project. 2. Create a new file named test.xml. 3. The scripted resource editor example opens the test.xml file by default, ignoring the XML file content. 4. In the Navigator, select the test.xml file. 5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...' -> 'Default Text Editor'. The expected behavior is that a new editor for the file should open because the selected editor type is different.", "SR": "1. Create a new basic project. 2. Create a new file named test.xml. 3. Ensure that the scripted resource editor example is the default editor for XML files. 4. Open the test.xml file in the editor. 5. In the Navigator, select the test.xml file. 6. Right-click and choose 'Open With...' -> 'Default Text Editor'. Verify that a new editor is opened for the file, reflecting the use of a different editor type."}
