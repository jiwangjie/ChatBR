{"id": "7581", "title": "ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer lets me edit objects using a set of rows that are name value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include ComboBoxCellEditor, constructor of which can be given the strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column. A problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It appears that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item, the problem is that the drop-down button may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet so it is clipped. From a user experience, they can no longer see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The combo box is not sized correctly in the property sheet. When a string in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. This causes the drop-down button to be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, so it is clipped. As a result, the user cannot see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider.", "EB": "The combo box in the property sheet should always have the same width as the property sheet column. If a string in the combo box is wider than the width of the column, the combo box should truncate the string and show ellipses (...) to indicate that it is clipped. The drop-down button should always be visible within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the combo box.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer with objects that have ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n2. Make sure one of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n3. Observe that the combo box grows to be the width of the widest item and the drop-down button is clipped off the visible area of the property sheet.\n4. Attempt to see the combo drop-down button by making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area."}
