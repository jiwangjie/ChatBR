{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "In the current setup, the Windows workstations are being used as X terminals to run Eclipse for development purposes. However, there is no UI option available in the preferences to define the default line delimiters for new files. This is causing an inconvenience, especially when working on a Unix product or program. We need to add a UI feature to allow users to set the default line delimiters for new files.", "OB": "Currently, there is no UI option available in the preferences to define the default line delimiters for new files.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to have a UI feature in the preferences that allows users to define the default line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation. 2. Go to the preferences. 3. Look for the option to define the default line delimiters for new files. 4. Observe that there is no such option available. "}
