{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1: Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299: In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual behavior is different as observed in the attached example WAR file. When visiting the page and checking the actual cookie and the reload link, the observed behavior does not match the expected behavior.", "OB": "Actual behavior: The page sends the following cookie:\n\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\n\nBut the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid':\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "Expected behavior: According to the mentioned phrase in 7.1.1, the expected behavior would be that the Reload link should be:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file in a Servlet 3.0 environment.\n2. Access the web application through a web browser.\n3. Check the cookie information being sent by the page.\n4. Observe the reload link and compare it with the expected behavior."}
