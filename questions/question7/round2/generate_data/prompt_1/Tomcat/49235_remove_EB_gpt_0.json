This behavior is not in line with the Servlet 3.0 specification. It's worth noting that my code works fine on Glassfish 3.0.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Build Tomcat 7.0.0 from SVN (r939221)\n  2. Use the following code:\n\n@MySomeAnn\npublic class MySomeClass {\n  ...\n}\n\n@HandlesTypes(MySomeAnn.class)\npublic class ModuleInitializer implements ServletContainerInitializer {\n  @Override\n  public void onStartup(Set<Class<?>> classSet, ServletContext ctx) throws ServletException {\n    for (Class<?> targetClass : classSet) {\n      System.out.println(targetClass.getName());\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\n  3.
