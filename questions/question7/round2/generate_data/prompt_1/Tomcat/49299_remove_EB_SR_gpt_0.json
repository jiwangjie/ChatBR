{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Error in Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 regarding custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299: The description in chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf states that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual result shows that the custom cookie name is not being used in the URL rewriting process. Instead, the 'jsessionid' parameter is being appended to the URL.", "OB": "When executing the web application, a session tracking cookie named 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' is set with a value of '658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F' and a path of '/cookiename'. However, when reloading the page using the 'Reload' link on the page, the generated URL contains the 'jsessionid' parameter, not the custom cookie name. For example, the generated URL is as follows: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "Expected behavior: The URL should include the custom cookie name instead of the 'jsessionid' parameter when the session id is encoded in the URL and URL rewriting is enabled.
