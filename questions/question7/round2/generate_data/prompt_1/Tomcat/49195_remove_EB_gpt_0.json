System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. It is possible that jsvc may show the same behavior, but this has not been tested yet.", "OB": "When running Tomcat as a Windows service and using 1 as the shutdown port, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this message, Tomcat stops successfully. After printing the message, Catalina.stopServer() is called which results in the shutdown of Tomcat. It appears that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server object is not null.", "EB": "When running Tomcat as a Windows service with 1 as the shutdown port, the error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' should not be printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. Tomcat should stop successfully without any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling Catalina.stop()."}
