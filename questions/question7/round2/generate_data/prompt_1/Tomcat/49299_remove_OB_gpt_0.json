I will provide the steps to reproduce the issue and attach a war file that can be used for testing.", "OB": "The observed behavior is not mentioned in the bug report.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to have the custom cookie name included in the URL when clicking the Reload link: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue: 1.
