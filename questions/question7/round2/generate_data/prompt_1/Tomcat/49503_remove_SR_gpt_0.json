{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503 - Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce:\n\n1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (80). The issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that was applied in r957960. The second instance fails, not in the expected way.", "EB": "In StandardServiceinitInternal(), I would expect the connector.init() call to fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, should be rethrown. The rethrown exception should then be caught in Catalinaload() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Start the first instance successfully.\n2. Start the second instance and observe how it fails in an unexpected way."}
