The attached war file reproduces this issue.", "OB": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, when accessing the page using the attached cookiename.war file, the actual result is that the page sends a cookie named 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid': 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a custom name is configured for session tracking cookies, the reload link on the page should use the same custom name instead of the default 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Deploy the attached cookiename.war file. 2. Access 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'. Verify that the reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name."}
