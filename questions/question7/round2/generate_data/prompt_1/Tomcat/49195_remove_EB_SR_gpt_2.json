That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using the value '1' as the shutdown port with a Windows service in Tomcat, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat stops successfully. Eventually, after printing the error message, the method CatalinastopServer() is called and it proceeds to perform System.exit(1), resulting in the shutdown of Tomcat. It should be noted that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalinaserver is not null.", "EB": "When using the value '1' as the shutdown port with a Windows service in Tomcat, no error message should be printed in the catalina.20100427.log. Tomcat should stop successfully without printing any error messages. The method CatalinastopServer() should be able to shut down Tomcat without relying on System.exit(1).", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Edit the server.xml file and set the shutdown port to '1' using the <Server port=\"1\" tag. \n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service. \n3. Check the catalina.20100427.log file for the error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' \n4. Verify that Tomcat stops successfully even though the error message is printed. \n5. Stop the Tomcat service using the service launcher and confirm that Catalinaserver is not null."}
