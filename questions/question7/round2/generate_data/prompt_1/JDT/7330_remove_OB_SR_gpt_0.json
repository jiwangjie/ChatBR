{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make 'Add Javadoc Comment' action available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal preference, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views in order to access all available actions. We need to make sure that all actions are reachable from the editor, including 'Add Javadoc Comment'.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available on text selection in the current editor view.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available when I select text in the editor.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Verify if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available in the context menu or any other globally accessible menu."}
