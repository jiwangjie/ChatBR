{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. The expected behavior is that the code assist should NOT automatically insert the selected item (DISPOSED) without taking into consideration that I have typed a '('. The expected behavior is that the code assist should recognize that 'dispose()' is a better match and automatically insert that instead.", "SR": "Build 204: Steps to reproduce the issue are as follows: \n1. Open the SWT code editor. \n2. Start typing the code 'button.dispose'. \n3. As soon as you type the '(', observe that the selected item in the code assist list is automatically inserted. This is incorrect behavior and it should NOT happen. The code assist should instead consider the context and match the closest possible option. In this case, the code assist should recognize that 'dispose()' is the desired option and insert that instead."}
