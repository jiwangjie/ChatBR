{"id": "8142", "title": "Bug 8142: No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "When I hit F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. org.apache.ant), I get the following error message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, could you please provide some clarification on what the error message means?", "OB": "When hitting F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. org.apache.ant), some error message is displayed. It is not clear what the error message means.", "EB": "When hitting F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. org.apache.ant), the expected behavior should be to display the class hierarchies of the internal jars. Additionally, the error message displayed should provide a clear explanation of the issue.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, try hitting F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. org.apache.ant) and observe the displayed error message."}
