{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, the following error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations, and setting the first operation creates an illegal state.", "EB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src' should not be displayed. The output location should be set to the project folder and the classpath should be updated accordingly.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new project with the source folder named 'src' and the output location named 'bin'.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location.\n4. Press 'Ok' to save the changes.\n5. Observe the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
