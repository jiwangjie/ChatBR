It should instead try to get the Java element and if that fails, display the element name rather than the fully qualified name.", "OB": "When searching for declarations, the Search dialog initialized with the fully qualified name does not return any results.", "EB": "When searching for declarations, the Search dialog should first try to get the Java element. If that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "1. Open the Package view in the Java application.\n2. Select a package from the view.\n3.
