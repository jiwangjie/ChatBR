I had to delete it and start again, paying more attention. Code assist should recognize that I have typed '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' better than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type '(', the automatic code assist inserts whatever is selected.", "EB": "", "SR": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'.
