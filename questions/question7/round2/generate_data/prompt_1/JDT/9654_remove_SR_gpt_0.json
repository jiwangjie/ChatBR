Duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second column could be merged.\n\na. The buttons are too small.\nb.

Duplicated name validation should be performed on the first page.\nii. The first and second column should be merged.\na. The buttons should be of an appropriate size.\nb. When the dialog comes up, the first table entry should be selected. The move buttons should be disabled if no table entry is selected.\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview should display the full name without being cut off.\nd. The dialog should resize appropriately based on the number of parameters.\n\nAdditional improvements: \n- The marking between the button and list is too large. It should be reduced.\n- The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\n- The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n- Multiple selection should be allowed, as the move up/down functionality can be applied to more than one item.\n- The signature preview text should be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as the hover state.", "SR": ""}
