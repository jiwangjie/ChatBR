{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When trying to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. After the progress dialog closes, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. This behavior is incorrect.", "EB": "The cancellation request should be honored when trying to add an exception breakpoint. The progress dialog should not close immediately, and the exception list should not come up if the cancellation request is made. Additionally, the cancel button should be disabled during the process of adding the exception breakpoint. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to false.", "SR": "1. Open the add exception breakpoint dialog.\n2. Start the process of adding an exception breakpoint.\n3. Before the process completes, click the cancel button.\n4. Verify that the progress dialog does not close immediately.\n5. Verify that the exception list does not come up after canceling.\n6. Verify that the cancel button is disabled during the process of adding the exception breakpoint."}
