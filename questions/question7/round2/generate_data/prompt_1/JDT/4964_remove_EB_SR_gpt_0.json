{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in build 204, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "The automatic code assist feature should recognize that when I type '(' after 'button.dispose', it should suggest and insert 'dispose()'.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Do not select any suggestions from the code assist list.\n4. Type '(' after 'button.dispose'.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe code assist feature should suggest and insert 'dispose()' after I type '(' following 'button.dispose'.\n\nObserved behavior:\nThe code assist feature inserts whatever suggestion is selected from the list after I type '('. In this case, it inserted 'DISPOSED' which is not the correct suggestion."}
