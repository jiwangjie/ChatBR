If it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon.\n\nNotes:\n- EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM): There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.\n- MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM): It is a warning. I will remove the message.\n- EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM): What is the issue with creating a default package? It can't be created by the user since it is always there.", "OB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard with an empty package name field, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard, no message should appear at the top when the package name field is empty.
