Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal preference basis, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions. All actions should be reachable from the editor.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a block of text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Verify if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is present in the context menu."}
