{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose", "EB": "The code assist feature should suggest and auto-insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' after typing 'button.dispose'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Open the code editor in SWT.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose' without explicitly triggering code assist.\n3. Observe that the code assist list appears, suggesting 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.\n4. Verify that the code assist feature suggests and auto-inserts 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' after typing 'button.dispose'."}
