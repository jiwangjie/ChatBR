Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste, which should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu when selecting text.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu when selecting text.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a block of text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not present.\n5. Switch to the Outline view.\n6. Repeat steps 2-4 and verify that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is now available in the context menu."}
