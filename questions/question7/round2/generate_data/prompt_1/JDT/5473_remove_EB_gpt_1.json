Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Regardless, it is confusing when there is a stray space, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character with spaces, executing ShiftLeft should move the first and second lines to the left by the same amount, ensuring consistent indentation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following lines: \n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.\n4. Verify that nothing moves."}
