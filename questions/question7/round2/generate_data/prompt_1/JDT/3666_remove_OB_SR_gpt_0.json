As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the baz call in bar to make the program correct.\n\nSteps:\n1. Execute the following code:\n\n   public class X {\n      void bar(X x) {\n         baz(x.foo());\n      }\n      int foo() {\n         return 5;\n      }\n      void baz(int i, int j) {\n      }\n   }\n\n2. Observe the code completion behavior.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nThe code should be changed to:\n\n   baz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\nActual Behavior:\n\nThe code is changed to:\n\n   baz(x.foo().foo())", "OB": "The code assist is eating too much code.", "EB": "The code is changed incorrectly.
