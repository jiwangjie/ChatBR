{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the IDE is eating too much code. The issue can be reproduced with the following steps:\n\n1. Open the IDE\n2. Create a new project\n3. Add the following code to a class:\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}\n\n4. The method call `baz(x.foo())` should be modified to `baz(x.foo().foo())`\n\nExpected Behavior:\nInstead of replacing the entire method call, the code assist feature should only replace until the cursor location which is after the first `foo()` call. The correct modified line of code should be `baz(x.foo()x.foo())`.\n\nNote: The choice between replacing until the end or until the cursor location should be conditioned by a keystroke, such as enter for replace until end and insert for replace until cursor location.", "OB": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature is replacing the entire method call `baz(x.foo())` with `baz(x.foo().foo())` which is not the expected behavior.
