{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. ", "EB": "The progress dialog should not close immediately upon cancellation. Instead, it should honor the cancellation request and prevent the exception list from appearing. If possible, the cancel button should be disabled during the process as well. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancelable parameter. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Open the application.  \n2. Navigate to the breakpoints section.  \n3. Click the 'Add Exception Breakpoint' button.  \n4. In the progress dialog that appears, click the 'Cancel' button.  \n5. Observe that the progress dialog closes immediately and the exception list still appears, indicating that the cancellation request is ignored. "}
