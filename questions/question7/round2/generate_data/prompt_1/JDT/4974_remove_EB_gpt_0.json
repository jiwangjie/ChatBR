{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Setting classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When you press Ok after changing the project properties to use the project as source folder and the project as output location, you receive the following error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations, and setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
