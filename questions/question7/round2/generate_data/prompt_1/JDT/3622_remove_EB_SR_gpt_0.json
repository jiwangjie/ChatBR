This message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. However, the package name field is empty at this point.

If it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon.\n\nNotes:\n- EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM): There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.\n- MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM): It is a warning. I will remove the message.\n- EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM): How to create a default package? It can't be created by the user since it always there.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package, even if the package name field is empty, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists.'", "EB": "", "SR": "1.
