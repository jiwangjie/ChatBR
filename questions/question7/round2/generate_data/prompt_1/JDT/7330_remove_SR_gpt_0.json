I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions. All actions should be reachable from the editor.", "OB": "When I selected text, the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' was not available in the context menu and I had to switch to the Outline view to find it.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the context menu when I selected text.", "SR": "1.
