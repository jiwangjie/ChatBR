{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project and sets the output folder to a bin directory, the system does not prompt to confirm the deletion and rebuilding of the bin directory.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project, the system should prompt them to confirm the deletion and rebuilding of the bin directory if it is selected as the output folder.", "SR": "1. Open the application\n2. Click on 'Create New Project'\n3. Select an existing directory structure\n4. Set the output folder to a bin directory\n5. Check if a prompt is displayed to confirm the deletion and rebuilding of the bin directory"}
