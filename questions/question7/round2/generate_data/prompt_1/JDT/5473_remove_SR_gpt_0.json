{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473 describes an issue with the ShiftLeft feature when tabs and spaces are intermixed. The problem was observed in Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, and then ShiftLeft is executed, the text does not move as expected. It is unclear how the behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). The presence of a stray space in the code makes it even more confusing, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to ensure consistent visual indentation between the two lines, executing ShiftLeft should result in the second line being shifted left and the first line being shifted left, at least to the space character (removing the tab). Additionally, the presence of any stray spaces should not affect the behavior of ShiftLeft. This behavior should be clearly specified to avoid confusion.", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces to ensure consistent visual indentation between the two lines.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n3. Observe the behavior of the text and ensure that the second line is shifted left and the first line is shifted left, at least to the space character (removing the tab).\n4. Additionally, check that the presence of stray spaces does not affect the behavior of ShiftLeft."}
