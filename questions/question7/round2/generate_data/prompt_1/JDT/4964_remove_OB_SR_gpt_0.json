Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using Code Assist, if I select 'DISPOSED', it is automatically inserted after a button object, resulting in 'button.DISPOSED'.", "EB": "When using Code Assist, if I select 'DISPOSED', it should not be automatically inserted after a button object.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor.\n2. Type 'button.'\n3. Invoke Code Assist.\n4. Observe the suggestions.\n5. Select 'DISPOSED'.\n6. Observe if it is automatically inserted after the button object."}
