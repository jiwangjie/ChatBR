{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Build 200110251. The ShiftLeft feature is not behaving as expected when there are tabs and spaces intermixed in the text.", "OB": "When executing ShiftLeft on the lines that contain a combination of tabs and spaces, the text does not move.", "EB": "After executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should also be shifted left, removing any tabs and aligning the text visually. Currently, the text does not shift at all when tabs and spaces are mixed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text 2\n   (Note: Replace <space> with a space character and <tab> with a tab character)\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nExpected behavior: The text on both lines should shift left, aligning the text visually and removing the tab character.\n\nObserved behavior: Nothing happens, the text does not shift."}
