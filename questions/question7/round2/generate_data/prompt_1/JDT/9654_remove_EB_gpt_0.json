The name validation is being duplicated on the first page.\n2. The first and second columns in the dialog should be merged.\n\nAdditionally, I observed the following behaviors:\na. The buttons in the dialog are too small.\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected, but both move buttons are enabled.\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview text is cut off.\nd. The dialog appears huge for methods with many parameters.", "OB": "a.
