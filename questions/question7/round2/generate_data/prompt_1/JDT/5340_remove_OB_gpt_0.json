Additionally, the cancel button should be disabled during this process. Currently, it is not disabled. To fix this issue, the cancellation request should be honored and the cancel button should be disabled when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run with the 'cancelable' parameter set to false.", "OB": "When attempting to cancel adding an exception breakpoint in the breakpoints pane of the debug perspective, the progress dialog closes immediately and the cancellation request is ignored.", "EB": "When attempting to cancel adding an exception breakpoint in the breakpoints pane of the debug perspective, the progress dialog should remain open and the cancellation request should be honored.
