The buttons in the dialog are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog is opened, no table entry is initially selected, but both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview of the parameter name is cutoff.\n\nd. The dialog appears excessively large for methods with many parameters.\n\nAdditionally, there are two suggestions for improvements:\n\ni. Perform duplicated name validation on the first page of the dialog.\n\nj. Merge the first and second columns of the dialog.", "OB": "a. The buttons in the dialog are too small.\n\nb.
