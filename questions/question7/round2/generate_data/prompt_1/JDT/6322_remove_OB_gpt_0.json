{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) etc. However, these obfuscated classes are being shown prominently in the 'All types' dialog, which is not expected. They should be less prominent.", "OB": "Obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) are being displayed prominently in the 'All types' dialog.", "EB": "Obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) should be displayed with less visibility in the 'All types' dialog.", "SR": "To fix this issue, there are two suggested options:\na) Sort the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter in the 'All types' dialog.\nb) Filter out the obfuscated classes completely from the 'All types' dialog.\nI suggest option a) as the solution."}
