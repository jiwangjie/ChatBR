{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder to a bin directory, the system allows the user to proceed without confirming if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder to a bin directory, the system should show a confirmation dialog to ensure that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the application and navigate to the new project creation screen.\n2. Select an existing directory structure for the project.\n3. Specify the bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Proceed with creating the project.\n\nExpected result: The system should display a confirmation dialog asking the user if they want to proceed with deleting and rebuilding the bin directory before creating the project.\n\nNote: Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt using the available .java files."}
