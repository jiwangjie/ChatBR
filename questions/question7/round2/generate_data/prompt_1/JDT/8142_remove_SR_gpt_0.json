When I try to view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, can you please explain the meaning of this message?", "OB": "When viewing the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I receive the message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "When viewing the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I expected to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars.", "SR": "1.
