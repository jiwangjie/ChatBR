Execute ShiftLeft. The text now moves. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). At any rate, it's definitely confusing if there is a stray space. You don't know why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "In a default text editor, type in the following: <space><tab>some text<tab>some text2. Now, highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft. Notice that nothing moves."}
