Currently, some actions are distributed based on personal taste, and it is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, and it should not be necessary to switch views.", "OB": "When selecting text in the editor, the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action is not available.", "EB": "I expected the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action to be available in the context menu or in the Edit menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the editor. 2. Select some text. 3. Attempt to find the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action in the context menu or the Edit menu."}
