Additionally, any stray spaces should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a text document with intermixed tabs and spaces.\n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n4. Observe if the text moves in the expected way."}
