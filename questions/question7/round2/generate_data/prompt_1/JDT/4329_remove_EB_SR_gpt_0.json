The package view initializes the search dialog with the fully qualified name, but this is not found when searching for declarations. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works. The expected behavior is that the search should first try to get the Java element and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "The search dialog in the package view initializes with the fully qualified name, but searching for declarations does not return any results.", "EB": "When searching for declarations via the package view selection and dialog, relevant results should be displayed.", "SR": "1.
