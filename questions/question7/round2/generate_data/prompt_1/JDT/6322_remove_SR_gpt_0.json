{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322 - All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "The Open Type dialog in JDK 1.4 is displaying obfuscated classes (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') prominently. This is undesirable as it clutters the dialog and makes it difficult to find the relevant classes.", "OB": "In the Open Type dialog, the obfuscated classes are shown prominently and clutter the interface, making it difficult to find the desired classes.", "EB": "The obfuscated classes should be displayed in a less prominent manner, distinguishing them from the regular classes in the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the application using JDK 1.4. \n2. Open the Open Type dialog. \n3. Observe that the obfuscated classes (e.g., 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') are displayed prominently. \n\nExpected behavior: The obfuscated classes should be displayed in a less prominent manner, clearly distinguishing them from the regular classes."}
