This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. When the output location is set first, it creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Open the project properties and change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
