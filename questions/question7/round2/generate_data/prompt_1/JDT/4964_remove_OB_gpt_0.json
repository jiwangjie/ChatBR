{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When typing SWT code, the code assist feature automatically provides suggestions for auto-completion. I encountered an issue where the code assist feature selected \"DISPOSED\" instead of \"dispose()\" when I typed \"button.\". As a result, I ended up with incorrect code and had to manually delete it.", "EB": "The code assist feature should be smarter in determining the appropriate auto-completion suggestion. In this case, the code assist should have recognized that I was typing \"button.dispose\" and offered \"dispose()\" as a suggestion instead of \"DISPOSED\". Alternatively, the code assist feature could be made case sensitive to avoid such issues.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code.\n2. Type \"button.dispose\".\n3. Observe the code assist feature and verify that it suggests \"DISPOSED\" instead of \"dispose()\".\n\nNote: Ensure that the code assist feature is enabled in the IDE settings and that there are other suggestions available for auto-completion."}
