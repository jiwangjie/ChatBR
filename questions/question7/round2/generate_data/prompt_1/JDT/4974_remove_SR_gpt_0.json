{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue is caused by the fact that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. Setting the output location first results in an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Similar to the validation process which checks the classpath and output location at once, the setting of the classpath and output location should be combined into a single operation. Additionally, the error message should be revised to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Set the output location to '/xy' \n2. Set the classpath to '/xy/src' \n3. Press Ok and observe the error message displayed"}
