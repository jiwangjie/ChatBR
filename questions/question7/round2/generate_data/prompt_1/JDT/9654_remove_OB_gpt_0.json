The first and second columns could be merged.", "OB": "The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button is not aligned with the dialog top. The table does not have a label to contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection is not allowed, as move up/down can only be applied to one item. The signature preview is not a label that wraps. The signature preview does not have the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "EB": "The marking between the button and list should be reduced. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table should have a label to contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up/down can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview should be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, change a parameter name to something very long and check if the preview is cut off."}
