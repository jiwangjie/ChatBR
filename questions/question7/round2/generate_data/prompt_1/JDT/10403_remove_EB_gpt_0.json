{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the system should display a confirmation message ensuring that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users may mistakenly choose a bin directory as the output folder, which may contain additional files that cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new project.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure as the project location.\n3. Select a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Proceed with creating the project.\n5. Verify that the system displays a confirmation message ensuring the scrubbing of the output directory and successful rebuilding of the project."}
