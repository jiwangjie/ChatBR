It is confusing because it is unclear why the text won't shift. It seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). If there is a stray space, it makes it even more confusing.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually, executing ShiftLeft should shift the second line left and the first line left, at least to the space character.", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command and observe the behavior of the text movement."}
