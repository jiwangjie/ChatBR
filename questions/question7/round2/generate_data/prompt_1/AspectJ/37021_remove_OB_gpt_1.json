The issue can be reproduced by running the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory. Please note that these tests may return false positives as filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. It appears that in AJDT, if the filename is not meaningful to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "The observed behavior is not specified.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the provided code in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory.\n2. Check the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.\n3. Observe that the sourcepath is listed in the incorrect form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
