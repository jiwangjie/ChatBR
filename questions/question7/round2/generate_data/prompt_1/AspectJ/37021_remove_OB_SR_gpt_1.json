Currently, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'. This issue can be reproduced by running the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' folder. It is important to note that these tests may return false positives as filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. Additionally, it seems that AJDT simply omits the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.

Run the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' folder\n2. Observe the declare warning messages and note that the source path is listed in the incorrect format\n3.
