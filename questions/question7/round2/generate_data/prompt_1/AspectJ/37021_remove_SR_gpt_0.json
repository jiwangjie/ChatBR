To see the problem, please run the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. Please note that the tests have limitations - they may give false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages (which is not enabled). I observed this issue in AJDT, where AJDT simply omits the filename if it doesn't make sense to them.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames don't appear at all, but these tests didn't reproduce that problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "1. Open the project\n2. Compile the project\n3. View the declare warning messages for the .class files in the injars\n4.
