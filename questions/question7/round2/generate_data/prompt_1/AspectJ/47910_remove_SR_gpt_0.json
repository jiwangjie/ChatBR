{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc to compile source files and then using the outjar parameter to create a jar file, the resulting jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, even if there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file in the source directory.", "OB": "After running the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>', a file with a .jar extension is created. However, upon inspection, it is found that the resulting file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The outjar parameter should create a valid jar file. This means that the resulting file should include the necessary MANIFEST.MF file, if it exists in the source directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>'.\n2. Verify that the resulting jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, even if there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file in the source directory."}
