{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using the 'outjar' option with ajc, the resulting jar file is missing the MANIFEST.MF file even though there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside the source directory.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' option followed by 'outjar' option and specify an output file with a .jar extension, the resulting file is created successfully. However, when I try to open the file, it fails to load as a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file present inside.", "EB": "After using the 'outjar' option with ajc, the resulting file should be a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file included.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>' where <mydir> is the source directory containing the METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file.\n2. Verify that an output file named <my.jar> is created.\n3. Attempt to open the <my.jar> file and observe that it is not recognized as a valid jar file due to the absence of the MANIFEST.MF file."}
