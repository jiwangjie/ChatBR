When running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/, the problem can be observed. It is important to note that these tests have limitations. They may return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it may simply omit it.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars should be displayed as 'app/Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ and check the declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars. Verify that the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'."}
