{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d . option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d . I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter running the command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. The compiled file, test.class, is placed in the wrong location, causing the following error when trying to run the program:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe compiled file should be placed in the correct location, allowing the program to run without errors.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nRun the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nThis workaround should resolve the issue.\n\nNote: The behavior of the ajc command should be consistent with the javac command.", "OB": "The compiled file, test.class, is placed in the wrong location, resulting in the 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError' error when trying to run the program.", "EB": "The compiled file should be placed in the correct location, allowing the program to run without errors.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the command 'ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java'."}
