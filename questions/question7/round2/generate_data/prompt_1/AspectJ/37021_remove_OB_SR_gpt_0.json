See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to reproduce the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. I encountered this issue in AJDT. When the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.", "OB": "N/A", "EB": "In the declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the incorrect format 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "SR": "1. Open the project in AJDT.\n2. Navigate to the tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. directory.\n3. Run the provided code to encounter the issue.\n4. Observe the declare warning messages and note the incorrect format of the source path."}
