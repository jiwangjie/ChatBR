Currently, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. The problem can be reproduced by running the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' directory.\n\nIt is worth noting that these tests have limitations. They may generate false positives due to the lack of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. Additionally, in some cases, the filenames may not appear at all.\n\nExpected Behavior: The source path in declare warning messages should be correctly formatted as 'app/Main' when targeting .class files from injars.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'.
