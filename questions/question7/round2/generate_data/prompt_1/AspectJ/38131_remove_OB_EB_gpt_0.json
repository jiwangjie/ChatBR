This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command: \n\n   ajc -d subpackage\\ Test.java\n\nAfter executing the above command, you will see a directory named \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory, which is not the expected behavior. The expected behavior is that the compiled class file should be placed in the existing \"subpackage\" directory, not a new directory with the same name.\n\nThis bug is not a critical issue, but it needs to be fixed to align with the expected behavior of other compilers like javac.", "OB": "The compiled class file is placed in subpackage\\subpackage directory.", "EB": "The compiled class file should be placed in the existing subpackage directory.", "SR": "Create a class in a subpackage and compile it using the ajc command with the -d option."}
