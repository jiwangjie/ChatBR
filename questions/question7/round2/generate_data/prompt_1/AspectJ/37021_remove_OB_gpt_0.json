See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the problem. These tests can give false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.)", "OB": "N/A", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "SR": "1.
