However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it does not have a MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc suggests that the 'outjar' parameter is intended to create a zip file, but it doesn't make sense that a parameter named 'outjar' would create a zip file.", "EB": "When I call ajc with the parameters sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, the output file should be a valid jar file that contains the MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n 1. Run ajc with the parameters sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar. \n 2. Check the generated <my.jar file to verify that it does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file."}
