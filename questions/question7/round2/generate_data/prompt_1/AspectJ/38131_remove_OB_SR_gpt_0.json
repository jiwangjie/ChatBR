{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131 - ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with the change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n    package subpackage;\n\n    public class Test {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n        }\n    }\n\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nCurrently, when running the above command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. The expected behavior should be the same as javac, where the compiled class file should be placed in the same directory as the source file.\n", "OB": "When compiling a class from a subpackage using ajc without the -d option, ajc creates a directory named \"subpackage\" under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "When compiling a class from a subpackage using ajc without the -d option, the compiled class file should be placed in the same directory as the source file.", "SR": "Create a class in a subpackage.
