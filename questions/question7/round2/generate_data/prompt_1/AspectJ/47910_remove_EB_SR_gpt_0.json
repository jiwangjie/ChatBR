{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using the ajc command with the options 'sourceroots <mydir' and 'outjar <my.jar', an output file with a .jar extension is created. However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation states that the 'outjar' option should put the output classes in a zip file, but it does not make sense for a parameter called 'outjar' to create a zip file without a MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I call 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>', an output file is created with a .jar extension, but it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the output file created with the 'outjar' option should be a valid jar file and contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the command line interface.\n2. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>'.\n3. Check the contents of the generated <my.jar> file and verify that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
