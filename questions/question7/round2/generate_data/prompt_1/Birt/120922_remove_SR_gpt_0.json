Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved, and the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled \"Error\" (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder). The error message is not very clear, it simply says \"Source page is dirty.\"", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to provide a clear message indicating that the XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog also needs to use a better title (and certainly should not have the quotes).", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Open the Layout Editor.\n3. Make changes to the XML in the \"source\" view.\n4. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n5. Observe the error message indicating the need to save changes."}
