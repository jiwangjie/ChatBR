{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression includes a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior results in trouble when working with XPath expressions in this way.", "EB": "The plain XPath expression (pre-pended with the path from the data set selector itself) should be used instead, without stripping any selection parts. Filtering should be an optional feature for those who need it.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping that includes a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog and save the RelationInformation.\n5. Verify that the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
