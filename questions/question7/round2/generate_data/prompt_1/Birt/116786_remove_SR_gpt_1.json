{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer is currently storing the absolute path. For example, <property name=\"fileName\">/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when a library is included in a report design. For example, if the report design is in $project/test, the relative path should be used.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the BIRT designer\n2. Create or open a report design\n3. Add a library to the report design\n4. Save the report design\nExpected behavior:\nThe library include should store the relative path instead of the absolute path."}
