Attempt to select any item in the outline view for the first time.\n\nExpected Behavior: The selected item should be highlighted and marked as selected on the first attempt. The focus should remain on the selected item and not jump to the library file node.\n\nObserved Behavior: The focus jumps to the library file node in the outline view and the item is not selected on the first attempt. The item can only be selected on subsequent attempts.", "OB": "The focus jumps to the library file node in the outline view and the item is not selected on the first attempt.
