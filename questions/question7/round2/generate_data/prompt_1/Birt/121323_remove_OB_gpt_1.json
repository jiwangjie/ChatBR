{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when leaving the dialog. This issue occurs when entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left']. The selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap, but when leaving the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior leads to trouble.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when leaving the dialog. It strips off the selection part in the XPath expression for the column mapping and loses the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist filter information when leaving the dialog. The selection part in the XPath expression for the column mapping should be retained and not lost from the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part (e.g., section[@id='left']).\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check if the filter information is persisted in the .rptdesign file.\n\nExpected result: The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog should be persisted and not lost."}
