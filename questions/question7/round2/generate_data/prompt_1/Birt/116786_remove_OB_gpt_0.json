{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library includes should store relative paths", "description": "", "OB": "The BIRT designer does not generate or save relative paths when including a library in a report design. When including a library from a different location, the path is saved as an absolute path.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save relative paths when including libraries in a report design. This means that when a library is included from a different location, the path should be saved as a relative path instead of an absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a report design in the BIRT designer.\n2. Include a library from a different location, such as '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.\n3. Save the report design.\n4. Close and reopen the report design.\n5. Check the path of the included library to see if it is saved as a relative path."}
