{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, all tables and columns are loaded immediately when the page is opened. This causes a delay in loading the page and may be inefficient for large data sources with numerous tables and columns. The expected behavior is to load the tables and columns on demand, meaning they should be loaded only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. Therefore, the observed behavior is that the tables and columns are loaded unnecessarily, causing performance issues.", "OB": "Currently, when opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page, all tables and columns are loaded immediately.", "EB": "The tables and columns should be loaded on demand when expanding the tree or applying a filter.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page.\n2. Verify that all tables and columns are loaded immediately.\n3. Expand the tree and verify if the tables and columns are loaded on demand.\n4. Apply a filter and verify if the tables and columns are loaded on demand."}
