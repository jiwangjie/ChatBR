However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to the .rptdesign file but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Check if the RelationInformation is persisted correctly to the .rptdesign file.\n5. Check if the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is retained."}
