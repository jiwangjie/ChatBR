{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'] in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to a lot of trouble.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog and check if the RelationInformation is persisted in the .rptdesign file, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
