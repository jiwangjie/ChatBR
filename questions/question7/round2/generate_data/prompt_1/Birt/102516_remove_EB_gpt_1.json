{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor doesn't load tables and columns on demand", "description": "When using the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query, the tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source loads all the schemas (catalogs) on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers. This can result in several hundred tables being displayed. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but the tree is still being populated on load, causing a warning message. Bug 101372 requests the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control shows every schema (catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. The schema filter is present in the code, but the tree is still being populated on load, resulting in a warning message.", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, the schema should not be queried immediately. Instead, the tables and columns should be loaded on demand. The schema filter should be applied to limit the items that are initially displayed.", "SR": "1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Observe that the schema is not immediately loaded, and the tables and columns are not displayed.\n3. Apply the schema filter and observe that only the relevant items are displayed."}
