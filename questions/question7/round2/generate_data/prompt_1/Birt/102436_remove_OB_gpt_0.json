If the value is invalid, it should display an error message and prevent the user from saving the design.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT report designer.\n2. Create a new report.\n3. Add a DateTime type report parameter.\n4. In the defaultvalue field of the report parameter, enter an invalid date string, such as \"55/66/9999\".\n5. Try to save the design.\n\nExpected result: The designer should display an error message indicating that the date string is invalid and prevent the user from saving the design."}
