{"id": "108822", "title": "More effective disk sorting logic needed for handling border values in row values", "description": "", "OB": "The current disk sorting logic does not handle border values in row values properly.", "EB": "A more effective logic is expected to process disk sorting when there are border values in row values. An improvement could be to sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Sort the data on disk. 2. Verify that the data being processed is less than 40000 rows. 3. Perform the following operations: a. Save the file as a temporary file. b. Load the file into memory. c. Sort the data. d. Save the file to the temporary file."}
