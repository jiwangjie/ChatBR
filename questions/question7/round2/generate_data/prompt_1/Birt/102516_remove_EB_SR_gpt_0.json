{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. When using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, the schema filter is applied, however, there is still a warning message displayed on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, however, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The tree control should only load the tables and columns on demand, rather than populating them all on load. This should improve performance and avoid the warning message on load.", "SR": "1. Launch the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Note that the tree control shows every schema (catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables.\n3. Apply the schema filter.\n4. Observe that there is still a warning message displayed on load as the tree is being populated on load. This should be avoided by loading tables and columns on demand."}
