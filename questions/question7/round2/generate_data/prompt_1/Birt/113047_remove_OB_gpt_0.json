Create a new data set without a SQL statement. 2. Open the data set editor and navigate to the data source page. 3. Change the data source. The new data source should have no database, table, or column information listed. Actual result: No children nodes are listed when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab. Close the data set editor and reopen it."}
