{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "The bug report is about the behavior of the report design when including a library. Currently, the report design stores the absolute path of the library, but it should save the relative path instead.", "OB": "Currently, when I include a library in a report design, I see that the report design stores the absolute path of the library instead of the relative path. For example, <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the report designer should generate and save the relative path when a library is included in the report design. For example, if my report design is located at $project/test and I include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the report design should store the relative path to the library, like <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library by selecting 'Library' from the menu and choosing the library file.\n4. Save the report design.\n\nExpected result:\nThe <property> tag for the included library should contain the relative path instead of the absolute path."}
