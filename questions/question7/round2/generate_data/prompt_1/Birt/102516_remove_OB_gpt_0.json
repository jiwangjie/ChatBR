The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes some time to load. Eventually, a message is displayed saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "The data set editor should load the tables and columns on demand. It should defer the loading of the tree until the user expands it or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the delay in loading the entire schema. The result should be the display of the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Bug 101372 requests the ability to filter based on schema and is related to this issue.
