The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait. Eventually, the user gets the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, the tables and columns should be loaded on demand, instead of querying the entire schema upfront. This will improve the performance and prevent the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query. Observe that the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait for the tables and columns to load. Verify that the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed. The expected behavior is that the tables and columns should load on demand, without any delay or limitation on the number of items.", "link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/showbug.cgi?id=102516"}
