However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. The issue is that XPath expressions should not be treated in this way as it will cause numerous problems.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.
