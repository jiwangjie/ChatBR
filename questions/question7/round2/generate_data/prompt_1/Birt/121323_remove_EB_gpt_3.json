{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior of treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.

Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3.
