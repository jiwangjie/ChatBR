", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Configure the program to perform disk sorting on a dataset with 40000 rows. 2. Set the program to process a subset of the data that is less than 40000 rows. 3. Observe the program performing the following operations: a. Saving the data as a temporary file. b. Loading the temporary file into memory. c. Sorting the data. d. Saving the sorted data to another temporary file. "}
