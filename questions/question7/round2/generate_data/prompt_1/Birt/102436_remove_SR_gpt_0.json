{"id": "102436", "title": "Bug 102436 - Date/time value not stored correctly in report design", "description": "An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected. When creating a new 'DateTime' type report parameter in the BIRT report designer, if an invalid date string is entered in the 'default value' field, such as '55/66/9999', the invalid value is accepted and saved in the report design. This causes two problems. Firstly, the model should have stored a dateTime type constant using the XML schema date/time format (yyyymmddThh:mm:ss) to ensure portability. Secondly, the date value should have been validated by the UI or model.", "OB": "When a new 'DateTime' type report parameter is created in the BIRT report designer, if an invalid date string '55/66/9999' is entered in the 'default value' field, the invalid value is accepted and saved in the report design.", "EB": "The system should reject the invalid date string and display an error message indicating that the date format is invalid.", "SR": "1.
