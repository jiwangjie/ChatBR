{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic is needed to process disk sorting when there is a boundary value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting on disk, if we sort a dataset of 40,000 rows and set the program to process only a subset of the data less than 40,000, the program performs the following operation:", "EB": "The program should implement a more efficient logic to handle disk sorting when there is a boundary value for the row value.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort a dataset of 40,000 rows on disk. \n2. Set the program to process a subset of the data less than 40,000 rows.\n3. Observe the operation performed by the program and validate if it is efficient."}
