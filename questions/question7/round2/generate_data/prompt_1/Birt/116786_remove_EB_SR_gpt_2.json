{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When inspecting the report design, I noticed that the property 'fileName' contains an absolute path instead of a relative path. This is causing issues when accessing the report from different directories. The incorrect property is: <property name='fileName'>E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The 'fileName' property should store the relative path to the library, rather than the absolute path. For example, it should be: <property name='fileName'>../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open the report design and check the value of the 'fileName' property. It should be an absolute path. Replace it with a relative path and save the file. Then, try accessing the report from a different directory to ensure it is working correctly."}
