When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1.

Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Verify that the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign.\n6.
