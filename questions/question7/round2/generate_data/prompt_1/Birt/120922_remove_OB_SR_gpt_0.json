Currently, when the user makes changes to the source, a dialog box pops up with the message 'Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved.' (including the quotes). The user then needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog box provides options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would do nothing and keep the user on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog box is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "The 'Error' dialog box is displayed when the user makes changes to the XML Report Design", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog box with a clearer title and without the quotes. The dialog should clearly indicate that the XML Report Design has been modified.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Make changes to the source.\n3. Verify that a dialog box with a clear title indicating the modified XML Report Design is displayed.\n4. Verify that the dialog provides options to save or discard the changes, and a cancel option to remain on the Source page."}
