The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. The code from CVS dated 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message during the page load since the tree is being populated all at once. It would be ideal if the load of the tree can be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which includes several hundred tables.
