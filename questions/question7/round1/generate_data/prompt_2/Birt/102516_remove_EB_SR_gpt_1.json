{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. However, I have noticed that even with the schema filter in place, I still receive a warning message upon loading the page because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema on the system, resulting in a long list of tables and columns being loaded on page load. This causes a warning message to appear.", "EB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page should only load tables and columns on demand, rather than loading all schemas on page load. This will prevent the warning message from appearing upon page load.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Check if the tree control shows every schema on the system.\n3. Verify if a warning message appears upon loading the page.\n4. Repeat the process with the suggested changes to see if the tree control only loads tables and columns on demand, and no warning message appears upon page load."}
