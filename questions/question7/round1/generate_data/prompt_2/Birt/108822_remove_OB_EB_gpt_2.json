{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic required to handle disk sorting when there is a boundary value for row count", "description": "When sorting data on disk, if there are 40000 rows of data and the program is configured to process data less than 40000 rows, the following operations are performed:\n1. The data is saved as a temporary file\n2. The file is loaded into memory\n3. The data is sorted\n4. The sorted data is saved to a temporary file", "OB": "It is observed that the disk sorting process is not efficient when there is a boundary value for the row count", "EB": "The disk sorting process should perform efficiently even when there is a boundary value for the row count", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set up a data set with at least 40000 rows\n2. Configure the program to process data less than 40000 rows\n3. Sort the data on disk\n4. Check if the disk sorting process is efficient and completes successfully"}
