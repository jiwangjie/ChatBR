{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues.", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The filter information should be persisted along with the RelationInformation to the .rptdesign file.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' in the column mapping.\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Open the .rptdesign file and check if the filter information is still present."}
