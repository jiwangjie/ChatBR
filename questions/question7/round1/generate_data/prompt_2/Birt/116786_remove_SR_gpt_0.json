{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "", "OB": "When reviewing the report design, I noticed that the library include section stores the absolute path of the library file. This creates issues when the report design is moved to a different location. For example, in the property section, the fileName property shows an absolute path: <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>. Additionally, the namespace property is also missing the relative path information.", "EB": "Expected Behavior:\n1. When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should automatically generate the relative path for the library file.\n2. The relative path should be saved in the report design, instead of the absolute path.\nExample: If my report design is located at $project/test, the relative path for the library file should be saved as $project/test/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary", "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design or open an existing one.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Check the property section of the library include to see if the fileName property contains an absolute path instead of a relative path.\n5. Also, verify if the namespace property is missing the relative path information."}
