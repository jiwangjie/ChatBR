{"id": "108822", "title": "More logic needed to handle disk sorting with border values for row value", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for processing disk sorting is not working properly when there is a border value for the row value.", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to be implemented for processing disk sorting when there is a border value for the row value. This could involve sorting the data directly in memory and then writing it to a file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Prepare a dataset with 40000 rows.\n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000.\n3. Save the file as a temporary file.\n4. Load the file into memory.\n5. Sort the data.\n6. Save the sorted data to a temporary file."}
