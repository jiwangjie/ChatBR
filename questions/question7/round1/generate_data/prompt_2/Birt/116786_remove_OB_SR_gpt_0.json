{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. Currently, the absolute path is being stored. This causes issues when the report design is moved to another location or shared with others.", "OB": "Currently, when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer generates and saves the absolute path of the library.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path of the library when it is included in a report design.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the BIRT designer and create a new report design.\n2. Include a library in the report design.\n3. Save the report design.\n4. Move the report design to a different folder or share it with another user.\n5. Open the report design and check the path of the included library.
