{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which easily amounts to several hundred tables. Although there is a schema filter in the code, I still encounter a warning message when loading the page since the entire tree is being populated on load. Please consider implementing a solution where the tree is loaded only when the user expands it or applies a filter.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor loads every schema on the system and displays them in the tree control, resulting in a warning message upon page load.", "EB": "The load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands it or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
