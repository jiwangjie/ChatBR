{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not retain the filter information when leaving the dialog and saving the project. This can lead to inconsistencies and trouble when working with XPath expressions as column mappings.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog and saving the project, the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should retain the filter information even after leaving the dialog and saving the project. This will ensure that the selected XPath expression is stored correctly and consistently.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for a column mapping with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'].\n3. Verify that the selection is correctly stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog and save the project.\n5. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog and verify that the previously entered filter information is still present."}
