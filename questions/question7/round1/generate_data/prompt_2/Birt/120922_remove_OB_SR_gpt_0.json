{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: \"Dirty Page\" behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "The behavior of the \"Dirty Page\" feature in the XML Report Designer editor should be improved. Currently, when the source is not saved, a message pops up asking the user if they want to save the changes, discard the changes, or cancel. However, this message is titled \"Error\" (including the quotes), which is misleading. Furthermore, the behavior of the options is not clear to the user.\n\nA better and more typical approach would be to inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed and prompt them to save or discard the changes. The dialog's title should be more appropriate and should not include the quotes.", "OB": "The message title is currently shown as 'Error' (including the quotes) instead of something more appropriate for a 'Dirty Page' warning. The behavior of the options is also unclear.", "EB": "The dialog that appears when the source is not saved should have a more appropriate title and should not include quotes. It should inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed and prompt them to save or discard the changes.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Make changes to the report without saving.\n3. Try to switch to another page within the editor or close the editor.\n4. Observe the current 'Dirty Page' message behavior and the unclear options.\n5. Compare with the expected behavior and clearer options."}
