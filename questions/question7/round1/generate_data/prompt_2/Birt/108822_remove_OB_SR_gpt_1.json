The new logic should sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Copy the file to the destination folder. 2. Observe the sorting behavior for rows with border values. 3. Verify that the existing sorting logic is not efficient for handling border row values."}
