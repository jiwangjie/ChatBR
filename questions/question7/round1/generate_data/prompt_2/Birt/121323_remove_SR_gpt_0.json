{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The filter information should be preserved when leaving the dialog. It is suggested to allow the use of plain XPath expressions (prepended with the path from the data set selector itself) and let filtering be optional for those who need it.", "SR": ""}
