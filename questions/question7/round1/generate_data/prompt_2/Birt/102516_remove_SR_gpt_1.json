{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query includes a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily result in several hundred tables being displayed. Currently, even with the schema filter, the tree control is populated on page load, causing a warning message to appear. Instead, the load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control is populated with every schema, resulting in several hundred tables being loaded on page load.
