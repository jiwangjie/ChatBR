{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can result in several hundred tables being displayed. Despite the presence of a schema filter in the code (version from 6/30/05), a warning message is still displayed on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes some time to load. Eventually, a warning message is displayed, stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The data set editor should only load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema at once. This will improve the loading time and prevent the warning message from being displayed.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Open the data set editor. 2. Observe the loading time for the schema and the warning message that appears once the loading is completed. 3. Note that the warning message states 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Refer to Bug 101372 for a related request to filter the tables based on the schema."}
