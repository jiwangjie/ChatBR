{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is not persisted and is stored separately in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "After entering an XPath expression with a selection part in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection should be saved in the filterInfo HashMap and persist when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']', in the column mapping.\n3. Verify that the selection part is stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Click on any other element in the dialog.\n5. Close the dialog.\n6. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n7. Verify that the selection part entered in step 2 is still present in the column mapping."}
