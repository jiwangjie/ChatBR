{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When inspecting the report design, I observed that it stores the absolute path for the included library. The absolute path is displayed as <propertyname='fileName'/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>. Additionally, the property <property name='namespace'>lib1</property> is present.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design located in a project directory, for example, $project/test.\n3. Include a library from a different directory, such as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Verify that the BIRT designer generates and saves the relative path for the library include. For example, it should be stored as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary."}
