{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When using the report design in BIRT, I observed that the include for a library file stores an absolute path. However, it should be saving the relative path of the library file instead. Currently, the absolute path is being saved as:<propertyname=\"fileName\"/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property<property name=\"namespace\"lib1</property>", "OB": "The report design is storing the absolute path of the library file instead of the relative path.", "EB": "The report design should store the relative path of the library file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open BIRT and create a report design.\n2. Include a library file using an absolute path.\n3. Save the report design and observe the file path being saved."}
