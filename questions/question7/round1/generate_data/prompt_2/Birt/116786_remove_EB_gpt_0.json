{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "I observed that the report design stores an absolute path instead of a relative path for the included library. For example, <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\" /><property name=\"namespace\" value=\"lib1\" />.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open a report design in BIRT designer. 2. Include a library in the report design. 3. Verify that the included library's file path is stored as a relative path instead of an absolute path. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary."}
