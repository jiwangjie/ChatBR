{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, suppose the report design is located at $project/test. Now, include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "OB": "The BIRT designer does not generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design.", "SR": "1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Load a report design located at $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Verify that the BIRT designer generates and saves the relative path for the library inclusion."}
