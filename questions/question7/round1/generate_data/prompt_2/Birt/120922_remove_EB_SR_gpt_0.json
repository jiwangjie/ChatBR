However, the user is not provided with clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes. The error message is also titled as \"Error\". This behavior needs to be improved to provide better guidance to the user.\n\nCurrent behavior:\n- If you edit the XML in the source view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will receive an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The error message is \"Source page is dirty.\".\n\nExpected behavior:\n- When attempting to switch back to the Layout view after editing the XML in the source view, the user should be prompted with a dialog box titled \"Save Changes\" (including the quotes). The dialog should clearly state the options available: \"Yes\" to save the changes, \"No\" to discard the changes, and \"Cancel\" to close the dialog without taking any action.\n- The error message should be more informative and user-friendly.", "OB": "When attempting to switch back to the Layout view after editing the XML in the source view, an error message is displayed indicating that the source page is dirty.", "EB": "When attempting to switch back to the Layout view after editing the XML in the source view, a dialog box titled \"Save Changes\" should be displayed.
