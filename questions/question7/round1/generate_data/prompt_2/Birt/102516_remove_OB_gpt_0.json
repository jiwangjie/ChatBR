{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, which results in a long wait time. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema. The expected behavior is for the tables and columns to be loaded on demand, either when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This would improve the performance and responsiveness of the JDBC Data Set Editor.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, resulting in a long wait time.
