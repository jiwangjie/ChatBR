The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. However, when the data set editor is opened, users have to wait while the entire schema is queried. This process can take a long time and eventually display a message saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, users have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, tables and columns should be loaded on demand, reducing the waiting time for users. The message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' should not be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Open the data set editor for a SQL Query. 2. Observe the time it takes to load the entire schema. 3. Observe the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' after the schema is queried."}
