{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not retain filter information when leaving the dialog. This causes data stored in the filterInfo HashMap to be lost. Treating XPath expressions in this manner may lead to potential issues.", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information is not persisted and the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The filter information should be persisted when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, so that the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is not lost.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that when leaving the dialog, the filter information is not persisted and the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
