The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes the schema filter, but the warning message still appears on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor shows every schema on the system, which can be several hundred tables.
