Create a new data set without a SQL statement. 2. Open the data set editor in the Query tab. 3. Go to the data source page in the editor. 4. Change the data source to a new one that has no database/table/column information. 5. Observe that there are no children nodes listed. To verify the resolution: Close the data set editor and reopen it. The children nodes should now be listed according to the new data source."}
