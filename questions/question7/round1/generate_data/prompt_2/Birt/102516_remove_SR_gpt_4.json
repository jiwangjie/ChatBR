The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query includes a tree control that displays all the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema, which can easily be several hundred tables. Currently, even with the schema filter implemented, there is still a warning message on page load because the tree is being populated at that time.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page displays every schema on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being shown. The schema filter is in place, but there is still a warning message displayed on page load.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
