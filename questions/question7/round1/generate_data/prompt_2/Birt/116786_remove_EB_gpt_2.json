{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path of the library. For example, <property name=\"fileName\" value=\"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\"/>. This should be changed to store the relative path.", "EB": "The report designer should generate and save the relative path of the included library. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test and the library is located in $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: 1. Open a report design in the BIRT designer. 2. Include a library in the design from a different location, using a relative path. 3. Save the report design and observe that the relative path is correctly generated and stored."}
