{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not retain the filter information when the user closes and reopens the dialog. This behavior prevents users from easily reapplying the same filter criteria on subsequent usage of the dialog.", "OB": "Currently, when I set up filters in the XML Edit Data Set dialog and then close the dialog, the filter information is not saved. When I reopen the dialog, all the filters I previously set are gone.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should save the filter information and retain it when the dialog is closed and reopened. This would make it easier for users to reuse the same filter criteria without having to set them up again each time.", "SR": "To reproduce:1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.2. Set up some filters using XPath expressions.3. Close the dialog.4. Reopen the dialog.5. Verify that the filter information is still present and the previously set filters are retained."}
