{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: Improve 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor", "description": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, a dialog box titled 'Error' ('Source page is dirty.') is displayed. This dialog asks the user if they want to save or discard their changes. The options available are 'Yes' to save the changes, 'No' to discard the changes, and 'Cancel' to do nothing and remain on the Source page. However, this behavior needs improvement as it is currently causing confusion for users who have to figure out how to save or discard their changes.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that you need to save your changes. This error message does not provide clear instructions on what the user needs to do to save or discard the changes.", "EB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, a clear and informative dialog box should be displayed. The options provided should clearly explain that selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, selecting 'No' would discard the changes, and selecting 'Cancel' would do nothing and keep the user on the Source page.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view.\n3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n4. Observe the displayed dialog box and its options.\n\nPlease note that the current error message should also be evaluated and improved to provide better guidance on how to save or discard changes."}
