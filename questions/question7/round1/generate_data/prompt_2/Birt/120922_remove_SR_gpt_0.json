The problem is that the user is left to figure out how to save or discard the changes. The error message is not very helpful as it only states 'Source page is dirty'. Furthermore, the dialog is titled 'Error', which is not appropriate.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that you need to save your changes. The user is left to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder). The error message is 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a message such as 'XML Report Design has been changed. Do you want to save the changes?'. The dialog should use a better title (without the quotes) that clearly indicates it is a confirmation dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor.\n3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n4. Observe the error message indicating that the changes need to be saved.\n5. Observe the insufficient guidance provided on how to save or discard the changes.\n6. Observe that the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes), which is not appropriate."}
