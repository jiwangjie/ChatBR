{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This easily results in several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I can see the schema filter. However, I still see a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the user has to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually receives the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' due to the large number of tables in the schema.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the time it takes for the entire schema to be queried and the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message to appear. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema."}
