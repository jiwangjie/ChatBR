The expected behavior is that an invalid filter expression for row[0] should not return any result.", "OB": "The bug causes the data set to return the first result record even when the filter is set to an invalid expression.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that row[0] can only be generated after fetching all the data, and it should not be used as a filter expression.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Set a filter in the data set using 'row[0] equals to'\n2. Click on the 'Preview' tab\n\nExpected result: The data set should not return any result."}
