The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This list consists of several hundred tables. Currently, when using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, but I still encounter a warning message during the page load because the tree is being populated during the initial load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control shows every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed. However, even with the schema filter, the warning message still appears during the page load as the tree is populated at that time.", "EB": "The loading of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
