{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This treatment of XPath expressions can cause a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information specified in the XPath expression is not persisted and is lost.", "EB": "The filter information specified in the XPath expression should be persisted when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Check if the filter information is persisted correctly."}
