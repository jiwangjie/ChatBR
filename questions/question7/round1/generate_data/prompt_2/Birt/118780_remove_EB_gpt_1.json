Create a new datasource and a dataset. 2. Set an alias for the first column in the dataset as 'column1'. 3. Insert a data item and bind it to the dataset. 4. Open the expression builder and select the dataset. The column names displayed should reflect the aliases set for the columns in the dataset."}
