{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Incorrect behavior when custom cookie name is used for URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled).\n\nHowever, the actual behavior is different. When a custom cookie name is set, the page sends the cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page still uses 'jsessionid' as the parameter.\n\nAttachment 25442 contains the sample web application 'cookiename.war' which demonstrates this issue.\n\n", "OB": "When using the web application 'cookiename.war', the page sends the following cookie:\n\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\n\nHowever, the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' as the parameter:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4", "EB": "Expected behavior: If the custom name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' is set for session tracking cookies, the 'Reload' link should use the custom name as the parameter instead of 'jsessionid'.\n\nExpected Reload link:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": ""}
