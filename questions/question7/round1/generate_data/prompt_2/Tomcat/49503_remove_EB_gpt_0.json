{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load()", "description": "When starting Tomcat, the connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method. This issue was tested with trunk at revision 957942, so it may also affect version 7.0.0. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase that allows connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. However, this separate phase is missing in Tomcat 7. As a result, it breaks the fix for Bug 48625. To reproduce this issue: 1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully.", "OB": "When starting the second instance, it fails in an unexpected way. The exception does not occur because the connector does not try to bind to the port. Instead, the connector binds to the port only when the start() method is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connector should bind to its port during the Catalina.load() method, rather than waiting until the start() method is called. This will ensure that both instances of Tomcat can start successfully.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties file: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
