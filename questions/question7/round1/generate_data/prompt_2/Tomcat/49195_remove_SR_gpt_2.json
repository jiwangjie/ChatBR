The error message is as follows: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat actually stops successfully. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port in the server.xml file, the Windows service for Tomcat stops successfully but prints the error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' in the catalina.20100427.log file.", "EB": "It would be better to use 'wait(10000)' instead of 'sleep(10000)' in the StandardServer.await() method, so that it can be woken up by a 'notifyAll()' call, or use the 'interrupt()' call to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": ""}
