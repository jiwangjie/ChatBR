Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (80). This issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 applied in r957960. The second instance fails, but not in the expected way. The exception does not occur because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It only binds when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
