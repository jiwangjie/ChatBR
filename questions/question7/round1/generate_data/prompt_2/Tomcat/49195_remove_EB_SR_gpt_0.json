{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3, using 1 as the shutdown port with Windows service works, but it prints an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message suggests that there is no shutdown port configured and the server is not being shut down. However, this is not accurate as Tomcat actually stops regardless of the error message. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() method performs a System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It should be noted that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server object is not null. It is recommended to improve the handling of the shutdown port and remove the error message in this scenario. It would also be useful to test if jsvc exhibits the same behavior, although this has not been tried yet.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServerSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'", "EB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, no error message should be printed.", "SR": "1. Set the shutdown port in the server.xml3 file to 1. \n2.
