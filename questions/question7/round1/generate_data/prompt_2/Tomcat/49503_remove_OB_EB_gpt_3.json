{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When testing with trunk at revision 957942, it was observed that connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). This issue is also expected to affect version 7.0.0. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstart.start() methods [1], which allows Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. However, it appears that this implementation breaks the fix for BZ 48625. \n\nOB: \n\nEB: \n\nSR: "}
