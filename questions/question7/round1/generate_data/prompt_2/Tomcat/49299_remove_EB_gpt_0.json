{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting", "description": "The bug report states that in chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL. However, the observed result is that the page sends a cookie with a different name ('MYSESSIONCOOKIE'), but the 'Reload' link on the page uses the default 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie: Set-Cookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly, but the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file. 2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/."}
