However, the current implementation does not align with this statement. \n\nObserved Behavior:\n\nThe page sends the following cookie:\nSet-Cookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\n\nBut the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nI would expect the Reload link to use the custom cookie name as mentioned in chapter 7.1.1:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F\n\nSteps to Reproduce: "}
