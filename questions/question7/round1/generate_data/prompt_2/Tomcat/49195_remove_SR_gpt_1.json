{"id": "49195", "title": "Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "The bug report is about using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service in Tomcat. When the server is stopped, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file, saying 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat actually stops despite this error message. It is also mentioned that the behavior with jsvc is expected to be the same, but not tested.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service in Tomcat, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file saying 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat stops regardless of this error message. The method Catalina.stopServer() is called after printing the error message, which performs System.exit(1) resulting in Tomcat shutdown. It is also mentioned that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "To improve the behavior, it is suggested to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await() so that it can be woken up by a notifyAll() call, or alternatively use the interrupt() method to wake up the thread if it is known.", "SR": ""}
