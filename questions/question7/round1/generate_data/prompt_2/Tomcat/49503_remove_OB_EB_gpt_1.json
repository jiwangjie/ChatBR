{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects Tomcat 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. The first instance starts successfully.\n\nOB: Connectors are not binding to their ports in Catalina.load()\n\nEB: Connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load()\n\nSR: \n1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties\n   org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
