The error message indicates that no shutdown port is configured. However, Tomcat still shuts down as expected. I believe this behavior might be the same when using jsvc, but I haven't tested it.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, the following error message is printed in catalina.20100427.log:\n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nAfter printing the error message, the Catalina stopServer() method invokes System.exit(1), resulting in Tomcat shutdown. It is worth noting that Catalina server object is not null when the service launcher stops Tomcat.", "EB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, no error message should be printed in catalina.20100427.log. Tomcat should shut down successfully without any error indications.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
