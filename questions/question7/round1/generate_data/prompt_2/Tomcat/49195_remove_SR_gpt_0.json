{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, it works, but it prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log:\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\nDespite this message, Tomcat stops successfully. After printing the message, the method Catalina.stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It appears that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be awakened by a notifyAll() call. Alternatively, the interrupt() method could be used to wake it up if the thread is known.", "SR": ""}
