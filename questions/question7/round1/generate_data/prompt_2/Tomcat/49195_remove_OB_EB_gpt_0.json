However, an error message is printed during the shutdown process. It is possible to improve the way Tomcat is stopped, such as using System.exit(0) regardless of the configuration. It is assumed that jsvc may exhibit similar behavior, although it has not been tested.", "OB": "After installing Tomcat as a service on Windows and starting it, stopping the service causes an error message to be displayed.", "EB": "After installing Tomcat as a service on Windows and starting it, stopping the service should not cause any error message to be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Attempt to shut down the server through an OS signal or by calling Catalina.stop()."}
