{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Incorrect behavior with custom session tracking cookie name", "description": "The bug report states that in chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter when sessionid is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled). However, the observed behavior is different. The page sends a cookie with the name MYSESSIONCOOKIE, but the Reload link on the page uses the default name 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name. An attachment named cookiename.war has been provided to reproduce this issue.", "OB": "The web application sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' as follows:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nHowever, the Reload link on the page uses the default 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name when encoding the sessionid in the URL.\n\nURL used in the Reload link: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4", "EB": "The Reload link on the page should use the custom session tracking cookie name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' instead of the default 'jsessionid' when encoding the sessionid in the URL.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1.
