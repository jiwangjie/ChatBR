That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat stops properly but prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log: 27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down. This message is printed, but Tomcat stops regardless of it. After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "It would be better to improve the shutdown process in Tomcat. One possible improvement is to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(). This way, the shutdown process could be woken up by a notifyAll() call or an interrupt() call if the thread is known.", "SR": ""}
