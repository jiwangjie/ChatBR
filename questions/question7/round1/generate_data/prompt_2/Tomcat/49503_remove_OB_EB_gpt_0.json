There seems to be an issue in the implementation of Tomcat where the connectors are not binding to their ports until later in the start() method. This issue was tested with trunk at revision 957942 and is expected to affect version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat to allow the connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This issue essentially breaks the fix for BZ 48625.", "OB": "The first instance starts successfully.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two instances of Tomcat with the same configuration at the same time."}
