{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, it appears that connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). This issue is believed to affect version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate pre-startup phase that allows connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented through separate methods: Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start(). This bug seems to break the fix for BZ 48625. I observed this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that was applied in r957960. When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g. port 80). The startup sequence continues, but fails in Server.await().", "OB": "When attempting to start the second instance, the connector does not bind to the port. This is different from the expected behavior where the connector should attempt to bind during the startup.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start the first instance successfully.\n2. Attempt to start the second instance and observe that the connector does not bind to the port. Instead, it binds when the start() method is called.\n3. The startup sequence continues, but eventually fails in Server.await()."}
