{"id": "49299", "title": "Incorrect behavior regarding custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 states that a custom cookie name affects URL rewriting. However, the observed behavior does not match this expectation.", "OB": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled). \n\nActual result: The page sets the following cookie: \nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. \n\nHowever, when clicking on the Reload link on the page, the URL uses 'jsessionid' instead of the expected custom cookie name. The URL is as follows: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "Expected behavior: When the custom cookie name is set, the Reload link should also use the same custom cookie name in the URL, not 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file. \n2. Open the deployed application in a web browser. \n3. Note the cookie set by the web page. \n4. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page. \n5. Observe the URL in the address bar, specifically the presence of the 'jsessionid' parameter."}
