{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using port 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, there is a scenario in which Tomcat can be stopped with an error message being printed. It is possible that jsvc may exhibit the same behavior, but it has not been tested.", "OB": "When stopping the Tomcat service with <Server port=\"1\", an error message is printed.", "EB": "Instead of using sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), it would be better to use wait(10000) so that the thread can be woken up by a notifyAll() call. Alternatively, the interrupt() call could be used to wake up the thread if it is known.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example by calling Catalina.stop()."}
