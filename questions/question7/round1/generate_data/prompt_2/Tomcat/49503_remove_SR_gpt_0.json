{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503 - Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Bug 49503 - Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat cannot bind to privileged ports (such as port 80). The second instance fails, not in the expected way. The connector does not try to bind to the port, so the exception from connector.init() does not occur. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "In StandardService.initInternal(), I would expect the connector.init() call to fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. It should then be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start the first instance successfully.\n2. Attempt to start the second instance and observe the failed behavior described above."}
