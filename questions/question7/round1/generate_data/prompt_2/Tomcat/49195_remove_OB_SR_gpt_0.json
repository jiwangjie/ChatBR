That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.

This would allow the thread to be woken up by a notifyAll() call or an interrupt() call (if the specific thread is known).", "SR": "The bug report does not provide any steps to reproduce the issue."}
