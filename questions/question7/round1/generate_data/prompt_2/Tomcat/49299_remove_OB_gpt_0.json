Currently, the custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting and the default \"jsessionid\" is used instead. The expected behavior is to follow the specification and have the custom cookie name affect URL rewriting.", "OB": "Currently, when accessing http://localhost:8080/cookiename/, the URL is rewriting using the default \"jsessionid\" cookie instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "Expected result: when accessing http://localhost:8080/cookiename/, the URL should be rewritten as http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1.
