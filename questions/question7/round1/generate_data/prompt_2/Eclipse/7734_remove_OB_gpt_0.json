{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734 - System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When shutting down Windows with a WSWB session open and a dirty .txt file, the changes made in the .txt file are lost without any warning or prompt to save the file.", "EB": "The system should display a dialog box with the message 'Do you want to save your file?' and options to choose from: Yes, No, Cancel (which halts the shutdown).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Launch WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Observe that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shut down or reboot the computer.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- A dialog box should appear, giving the user a chance to save their dirty file before the computer is shut down or rebooted.\n\nActual behavior:\n- There is no warning or question message box, and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately without giving the user a chance to save the file."}
