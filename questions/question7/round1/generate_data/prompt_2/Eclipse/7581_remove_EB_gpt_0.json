{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer lets me edit objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include ComboBoxCellEditor constructor, of which can be given the strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet and the drop down button appears at the right edge of the column.\n\nA problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It appears that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The problem is that the drop down button may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, so it is clipped. From a user experience perspective, they can no longer see the combo drop down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor dropdown list are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the widest item, causing the drop down button to be clipped and appear outside the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Add a ComboBoxCellEditor to column two of the property sheet.\n3. Set the width of the property sheet column to a narrow width.\n4. Provide a dropdown list of strings with at least one string that is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor grows to accommodate the width of the widest string, causing the drop down button to be outside the visible area of the property sheet."}
