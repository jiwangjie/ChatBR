{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse, since they are cheaper than Unix boxes. Currently, when creating a new file, the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties('line.delimiter') is used, but this may not always be what the user wants.", "OB": "When creating a new file, the default line delimiter is being set based on the value returned from System.getProperties('line.delimiter').", "EB": "The user should be able to define the default line delimiters for new files in the preferences of the Eclipse IDE.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open Eclipse IDE on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter used for the new file.\n4. Verify that it matches the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties('line.delimiter').\n5. Ensure that there is no option available in the preferences to change the default line delimiters for new files."}
