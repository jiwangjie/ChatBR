", "OB": "When using the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet, the combo box does not size correctly. ", "EB": "I would expect the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same way as the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this issue is caused by us or SWT. ", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Open the property sheet. \n2. Add a property with a value that requires a drop-down list (e.g. a boolean property). \n3. Observe that the combo box for the property does not resize to fit the property sheet column. "}
