{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "On Linux, when running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000), the close button moves down when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller. This behavior is observed when the tool items move below the label. However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. This movement of the icons could confuse users.", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the close button along with the pulldown menu icon move below the label.", "EB": "In previous versions, the close button and pulldown menu icon would stay on the same line as the label, regardless of how small the view got. This consistency is important because users expect the close button to be on the same line as the label, located in the far right corner.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Observe that the close button moves down along with the pulldown menu icon."}
