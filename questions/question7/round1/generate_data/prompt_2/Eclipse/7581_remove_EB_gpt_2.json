", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet does not size correctly when the width of the combo box editor is larger than the property sheet column. The drop down button may be pushed off the visible area of the property sheet, making it inaccessible to users without resizing the property sheet view.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit objects using a set of row that are name value pairs in two columns.\n3. Use IPropertyDescriptor method to create a cell editor with ComboBoxCellEditor constructor.\n4. Provide strings to the ComboBoxCellEditor constructor.\n5. If any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box will grow to be the width of the largest item and the drop down button may be pushed off the visible area of the property sheet."}
