Then I went to the Java Perspective and tried to open a java file by double clicking on it. The file was opened in the workbench. Next, I right-clicked on the Java file and selected 'Open With' > 'System Editor'. However, nothing happened. The workbench should display a warning message indicating that I may overwrite changes and asking whether I want to continue. Alternatively, it should display an error message stating that I need to close all files first. We believe this is a safety feature in WSAD that doesn't allow external editing while a file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning message displayed.", "SR": "1.
