Create a new basic project. 2. Create a new file named test.xml in the project. 3. The file opens with the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content. 4. Select the test.xml file in the Navigator. 5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...'. 6. Select 'Default Text Editor'. The expected behavior is to open the file with the default text editor, but nothing happens and it reactivates the scripted resource editor example.", "EB": "When performing the steps mentioned in the OB section, it should open the test.xml file with the default text editor instead of reactivating the scripted resource editor example.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new basic project. 2. Create a new file named test.xml in the project. 3. The file should open with the scripted resource editor example. 4. Select the test.xml file in the Navigator. 5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...'. 6. Select 'Default Text Editor'. The file should now open with the default text editor instead of reactivating the scripted resource editor example. Notes: Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types."}
