Start WSWB and create a new project. \n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. \n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. \n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the \"Shut Down\" command to shut down or reboot the computer. \n\nExpected result: \nA warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their unsaved changes before the computer is shut down or rebooted. \n\nAdditional note: \nOther Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) provide similar warnings before shutting down to prevent data loss."}
