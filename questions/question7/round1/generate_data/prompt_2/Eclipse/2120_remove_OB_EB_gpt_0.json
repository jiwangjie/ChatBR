As a result, when the workbench is restarted, the MRU list is empty.", "OB": "When the workbench is restarted after shutting it down, the MRU file list is not displayed. It shows an empty list instead.", "EB": "The MRU file list should be persisted between sessions.

Open 2 or 3 files. 3. Shutdown the workbench. 4. Restart the workbench. 5. Verify that the MRU file list is empty instead of displaying the previously opened files."}
