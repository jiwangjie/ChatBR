Select both projects created earlier.\n3. Give the zip file a name (such as test.zip).\n4.

An error message box pops up, indicating that problems were encountered during export. The detail lists the file of the same name in project2 as the problem (e.g., foo.txt in project 2). However, if you rename foo.txt in project 2 to foo2.txt, there are no problems.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories.", "OB": "Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails.
