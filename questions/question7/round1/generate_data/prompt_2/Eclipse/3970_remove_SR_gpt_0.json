The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes).", "OB": "When creating a new file, Eclipse currently uses the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI preference option provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for line delimiters should include: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI option should be available in the Workbench so that all plugins can use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": ""}
