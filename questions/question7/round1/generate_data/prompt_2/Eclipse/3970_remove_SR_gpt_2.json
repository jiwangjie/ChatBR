{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Bug 3970 - The Windows workstations are used as X terminals to run Eclipse, as they are cheaper than Unix boxes. Currently, when creating a new file, the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties('line.delimiter') is used, which may not always be desired by the user. There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench for defining the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be used by all plugins to ensure consistency in line delimiters for new files.\n\nNOTES: [Please provide any additional notes here]", "OB": "The current behavior is to use the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties('line.delimiter') when creating a new file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters, as the end product is a Unix product.
