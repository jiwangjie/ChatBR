System Editor', nothing happens. There is no warning message or error message displayed.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Ensure that you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file.\n2. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n3. In the Java Perspective, right click on the Java file and select 'Open With .. System Editor'.\n4. Verify that a warning message is displayed informing that opening the file in another editor may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed stating that you should close all files first.\n\nNote: We believe this behavior is a safety feature implemented by WSAD to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."}
