When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X).

It should not move below the label.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. On Linux, with build 20011127, resize the view to make it smaller.\n3. Observe that the close button moves down below the label."}
