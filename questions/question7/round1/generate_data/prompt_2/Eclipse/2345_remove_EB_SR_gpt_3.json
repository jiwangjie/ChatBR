Go to ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example\n2. Create a new basic project\n3. Create a new file named test.xml\n4. The editor used by default is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content\n5. In the Navigator, select test.xml\n6. Choose 'Open With...' -> 'Default Text Editor'\n\nObserved Behavior:\nNothing happens; it does not open the file with the default text editor. Instead, it just reactivates the scripted resource editor example.\n\nNOTES:\nSearching for an existing open file should also consider editor types.\nIt should open a new editor on the file, because the editor type is different.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
