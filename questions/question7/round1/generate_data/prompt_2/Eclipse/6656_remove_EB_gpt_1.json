{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view is resized smaller", "description": "The close button in the Navigator view on Linux moves down when the view is resized smaller. This issue is observed in build 20011127, but not in build 20011116 on Nt2000. This behavior may confuse users as both the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move around when the view is resized smaller.", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller on Linux in build 20011127, the close button moves down below the label. The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move.", "EB": "The close button in the Navigator view on Linux should not move down when the view is resized smaller. The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) should stay in their original positions.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the Navigator view on Linux in build 20011127.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Observe that the close button, pulldown menu icon (triangle), and the close icon (X) move down below the label."}
