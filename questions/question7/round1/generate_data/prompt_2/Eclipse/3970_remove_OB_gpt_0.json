The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes).", "OB": "The current behavior is that when a new file is created on Windows, it has Windows line delimiters instead of Unix line delimiters.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters, since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preferences) to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values for the line delimiter should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario: Unix and Windows workstations used to develop a Unix product/program."}
