Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will open with the Java file.\n3. Close the Notepad or WordPad window.\n4. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by simply double clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n5. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected behavior: The workbench should display a warning message indicating that the file is already open in another editor and prompt the user to close it before proceeding.\n\nNote: We believe this is a safety feature implemented in WSAD to prevent external editing of a file that is already opened in WSAD."}
