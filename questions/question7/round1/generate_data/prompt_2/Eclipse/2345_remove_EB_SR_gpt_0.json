Create a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file called test.xml.\n3. Select test.xml in the Navigator.\n4. Choose 'Open With...' -> 'Default Text Editor'.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- Nothing happens; it does not open a new editor for the file.\n- Instead, it reactivates the scripted resource editor example that was used by default for XML files.\n\nThe expected behavior is that a new editor should open for the file since the selected editor type is different from the one already open.\n\nNOTES: ", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
