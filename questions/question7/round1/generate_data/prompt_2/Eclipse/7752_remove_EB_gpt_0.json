Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g. 'foo.txt').\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and choose 'Zip File' to export.\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects, give the zip file a name (e.g. 'test.zip'), and begin the export to zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name but different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up indicating that problems were encountered during export. The details of the error indicate that the file with the same name in 'project2' is the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name but different directories to a zip file should complete successfully without any error messages.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g. 'foo.txt').\n3.
