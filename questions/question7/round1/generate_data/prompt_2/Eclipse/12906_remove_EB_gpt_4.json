{"id": "12906", "title": "Bug 12906 - Unable to open file in another editor when already opened in one editor", "description": "In the Java Perspective, when a file is already opened in one editor and an attempt is made to open it in another editor, nothing happens. However, it is expected that a warning message should be displayed in the workbench, indicating that the file is already opened in another editor and asking whether to continue opening it or to close the file first. This behavior is believed to be a safety feature in WSAD that does not allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "OB": "1. In the Java Perspective, open a java file by double-clicking on it.\n2. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n3. Right-click on the same Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n4. Nothing happens. There is no warning message or error message displayed in the workbench.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n3. A Notepad or WordPad window should open with the java file displayed.\n4. Close the opened file.\n5. Go to the Java Perspective and open a different java file by double-clicking on it.\n6. The file should be opened in the workbench.\n7. Right-click on the same Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n8. A warning message should be displayed in the workbench, indicating that you may overwrite changes and asking whether you want to continue opening the file or close it first. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed stating that all files need to be closed first before opening another file."}
