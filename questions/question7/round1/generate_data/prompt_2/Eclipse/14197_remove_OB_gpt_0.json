{"id": "14197", "title": "Bug 14197 - Working set changes immediately when removed", "description": "When removing a working set, the package view immediately refilters in the background. It should only refilter when closing the working set selection dialog, not while manipulating the working set. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to the working sets, including cancelling the remove operation.", "OB": "When I remove a working set, the package view immediately filters.", "EB": "When I remove a working set, the package view should not immediately filter. Filtering should only occur when closing the working set selection dialog.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Create a working set with one project and select it so that the package view is filtered.\n2. Open the working set dialog again, create a second working set, and delete the first one."}
