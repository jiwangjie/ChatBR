There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for line delimiters should include: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation\n2. Create a new file\n3. Check the line delimiters used in the new file"}
