If I select test.xml in the Navigator and choose Open With... / Default Text Editor, nothing happens. It does not activate the Default Text Editor. It should open a new editor for the test.xml file with the appropriate editor type, because the editor type is different from the one that is already open.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
