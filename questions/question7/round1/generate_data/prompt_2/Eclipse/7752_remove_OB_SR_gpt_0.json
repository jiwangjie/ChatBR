{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752 - Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Export multiple files with the same file name under different directories to a zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nWhen exporting multiple files with the same file name under different directories to a zip file, the process fails and no zip file is created. For example, if there are two files named 'foo.txt' in different directories (e.g., 'project 1' and 'project 2'), the export fails.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories, allowing for successful export. For example, if there are two files named 'foo.txt' in different directories (e.g., 'project 1' and 'project 2'), the exported zip file should contain both files.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create two files named 'foo.txt' in different directories.\n2. Export both files to a zip file.\n3. Verify that the zip file contains both files with the same name under different directories.", "OB": "When exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, the process fails and no zip file is created.", "EB": "The zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories, allowing for successful export.", "SR": "1.
