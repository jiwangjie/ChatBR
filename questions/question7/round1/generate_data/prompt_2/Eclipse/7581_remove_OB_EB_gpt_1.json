{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects in a property sheet, I create cell editors for the name-value pairs in two columns using IPropertyDescriptor. I create ComboBoxCellEditor by passing a set of strings to its constructor. The editor appears in column two, with the drop down button at the right edge of the column. However, if any of the strings is wider than the width of the column, the combo box grows to accommodate that string, causing the drop down button to be clipped off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "The combo box in the ComboBoxCellEditor should be sized correctly so that the drop down button is always visible within the property sheet.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Edit an object that contains a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n3. Ensure that one of the strings in the drop down list is wider than the width of the column.\n4. Verify that the drop down button of the ComboBoxCellEditor is clipped off the visible area of the property sheet."}
