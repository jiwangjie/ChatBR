{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "The close button in a view, such as the Navigator, moves below the label when the view is resized smaller. This results in a usability problem as users expect the close button to remain on the same line as the label and located in the far right corner of the view.", "OB": "When resizing the view smaller, the close button moves below the label.", "EB": "The close button should stay on the same line as the label, even when the view is resized smaller.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the application on Linux. 2. Navigate to the Navigator view. 3. Resize the view to be smaller. 4. Observe that the close button moves below the label."}
