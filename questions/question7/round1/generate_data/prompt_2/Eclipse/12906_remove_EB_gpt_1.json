The workbench should display a warning message indicating that there are unsaved changes and prompt the user if they want to continue or an error message stating that all files should be closed first. We believe this is a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Ensure that you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double-click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files. \n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on a Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the Java file opened. Close this window. \n3. Go back to the Java Perspective, open a Java file by double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench. \n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. Observe that nothing happens. The workbench should display a warning message indicating that there are unsaved changes and prompt the user if they want to continue or an error message stating that all files should be closed first."}
