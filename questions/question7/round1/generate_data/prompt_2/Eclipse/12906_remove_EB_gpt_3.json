Observe that nothing happens.\nExpected: The workbench should display a warning message stating that the file may be overwritten and asking if the user wants to continue, or an error message stating that all files need to be closed first.\n\nWe believe this is a safety feature designed to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "", "SR": "1.
