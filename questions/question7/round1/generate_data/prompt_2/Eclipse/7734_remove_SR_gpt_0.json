{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. One feature that would be nice is to allow the applications to control the shutdown/save also, or to pop up their own windows that would also allow the user to stop the shutdown if Cancel is selected.", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with a dirty .txt file and the user shuts down Windows using the Start menu, there is no warning dialog box to give users a chance to save their file before the computer is shut down/rebooted.", "EB": "The system should provide a dialog box with the message 'Do you want to save your file?' and options for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' (which halts the shutdown).", "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu.\n5. Select the 'Shut Down' command to attempt to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected results: A dialog box should appear with the message 'Do you want to save your file?' and options for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Yes' should save the file, selecting 'No' should close the file without saving, and selecting 'Cancel' should halt the shutdown process."}
