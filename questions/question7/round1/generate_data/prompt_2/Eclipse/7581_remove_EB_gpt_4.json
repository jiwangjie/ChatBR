", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. The issue arises when the strings in the editor are wider than the width of the property sheet column. In this case, the combo box grows to match the width of the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be pushed off the visible area of the property sheet and get clipped. As a result, users are unable to see the combo drop-down button unless the property sheet view is made wider.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object that requires a ComboBoxCellEditor in the second column.\n3. Ensure that the editor strings are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the drop-down button is pushed off the visible area of the property sheet and is clipped. "}
