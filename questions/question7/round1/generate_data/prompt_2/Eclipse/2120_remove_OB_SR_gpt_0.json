{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120MRU File List is not persisted between sessions (1GE71Z0)", "description": "The MRU (Most Recently Used) file list is not being saved and restored between sessions. This means that when the application is closed and reopened, the files that were previously opened do not appear in the File menu MRU list. The expected behavior is that these files should be persisted between sessions. It is important to note that the implementation should use the IPersistableElement and should not peek into the underlying resource. Additionally, the IEditorInput may not necessarily be a resource.", "OB": "The MRU file list is not persisted between sessions. Files that were previously opened do not appear in the File menu MRU list.", "EB": "The MRU file list should be persisted between sessions. Files that were previously opened should appear in the File menu MRU list when the application is reopened.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Open multiple files.\n3. Close the application.\n4. Reopen the application.\n5. Check the File menu MRU list to see if the previously opened files are listed."}
