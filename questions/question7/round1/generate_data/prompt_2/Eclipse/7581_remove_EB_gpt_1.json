{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com>:\n\nIn the PropertySheetViewer, the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. When using ComboBoxCellEditor to create editors in column two of the property sheet, if any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the widest item. The issue is that the drop down button of the combo box may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, so it gets clipped. As a result, users are unable to see the combo drop down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet grows to the width of the widest item, causing the drop down button of the combo box to be clipped and off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object with ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Use ComboBoxCellEditor with strings wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the drop down button of the combo box is clipped and off the visible area of the property sheet."}
