{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet column. The width of the combo box doesn't match the width of the column.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box to always be the same width as the property sheet column. It should work the same as DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this issue is caused by our implementation or by the SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit) library.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Open the property sheet. \n2. Navigate to a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor. \n3. Observe that the combo box is not the same width as the property sheet column. \n\nExpected behavior: \nThe combo box should always have the same width as the property sheet column, similar to how DialogCellEditor behaves."}
