To reproduce the issue, refer to the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. Please note that the tests have limitations and may return false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, it is observed that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.)", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main.class\".", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars should be listed in the form \"app/Main.class\".", "SR": "1. Compile a Java/AJ program with the aspect files present in the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory.\n2. Enable declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars.\n3. Observe the source path in the declare warning messages and check if it is listed in the form \"app/Main.class\"."}
