{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc to compile source files and create a jar file, the resulting jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file, even though there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside. ", "OB": "I call ajc with the following parameters: sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar. An output file is created with a .jar extension. However, it is not a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file inside. The documentation for ajc mentions 'outjar <file - put output classes in zip file <file', which suggests that the 'outjar' parameter is supposed to create a zip file. However, it does not make sense to have a parameter called 'outjar' that creates a zip file instead of a jar file.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run ajc with the following parameters: sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar\n2. Check the contents of the created <my.jar file\n3. Verify that the <my.jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file"}
