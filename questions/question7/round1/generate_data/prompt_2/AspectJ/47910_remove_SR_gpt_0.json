The command successfully created an output file with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because it does not contain the expected MANIFEST.MF file in the METAINF directory.", "EB": "If the outjar option is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file that includes the necessary MANIFEST.MF file in the METAINF directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Run the command ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar; 2. Verify that the resulting jar file does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file in the METAINF directory."}
