To reproduce the issue, please run the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. . Note that these tests have limitations and may return false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it seems that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is omitted.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars in declare warning messages, the source path is incorrectly displayed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. In some cases, the filenames do not appear at all.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be displayed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Observe the declare warning messages and check that the source path is displayed correctly as 'app/Main'."}
