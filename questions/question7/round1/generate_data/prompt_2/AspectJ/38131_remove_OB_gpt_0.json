I am using version 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I suspect this may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a class in a subpackage like this:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n         System.out.println('Hello');\n      }\n   }\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved behavior: A directory called 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nExpected behavior: The compiled class should be placed in the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nNote: This issue does not have a significant impact, but it would be desirable to have the same behavior as javac.", "OB": "A directory called 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory when compiling a class using the 'ajc' command.", "EB": "The compiled class should be placed in the existing 'subpackage' directory when using the 'ajc' command.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, compile a class from a subpackage using the 'ajc' command with the -d option."}
