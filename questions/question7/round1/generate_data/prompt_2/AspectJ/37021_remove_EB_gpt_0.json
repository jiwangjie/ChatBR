{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When declaring warnings on binary files [java|aj], the source path is displayed incorrectly. To reproduce this issue, please refer to the code in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory. It should be noted that these tests may provide false positives due to the lack of filename checking during harness verification of messages. It has been observed in AJDT that when the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not replicate that specific problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, declare a warning targeting a .class file from an injar and observe that the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
