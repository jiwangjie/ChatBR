{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Use the following command to compile the class: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior (OB):\nA directory named 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB):\nThe compiled class 'Test.class' should be generated in the correct directory structure, i.e., subpackage\\Test.class.\n\nSteps to Reproduce (SR):\n1. Create a subpackage named 'subpackage'.\n2. Inside 'subpackage', create a Java class named 'Test' with a main method that prints 'Hello'.\n3. Compile the 'Test' class using the command: ajc -d subpackage subpackage\\Test.java\n4. Verify that the class is compiled correctly and 'subpackage/Test.class' is generated in the correct directory structure.\n\nNote: The issue does not occur when compiling with 'javac subpackage\\Test.java'.", "OB": "A directory named 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "EB": "The compiled class 'Test.class' should be generated in the correct directory structure, i.e., subpackage\\Test.class.", "SR": "1.
