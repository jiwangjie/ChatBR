To reproduce the issue, run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. folder. Please note that due to a limitation in the tests, false positives may be detected when detecting this error as filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, when the filename does not make sense, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars is currently listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, observe a declare warning message when targeting .class files from injars. The source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'."}
