{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d option. I am using ajc 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, such as:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- The compiled Test.class file is put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory, which is unexpected.\n- Running the java command results in an exception:\n   Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- The compiled Test.class file should be put in the subpackage directory and not the subpackage\\subpackage directory.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Compile the class again using one of the following commands to fix the problem: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java"}
