{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The issue is that when calling ajc with the sourceroots option and providing an output file with a .jar extension using the outjar parameter, the resulting jar file does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation states that the outjar parameter should put the output classes in a zip file, which implies that it should be a valid jar file, but in this case, it does not include the necessary manifest file.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the sourceroots option and provide an output file with a .jar extension using the outjar parameter, a file is created with the .jar extension. However, upon inspection, I noticed that the created file does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "Expected behavior is that when calling ajc with the sourceroots option and providing an output file with a .jar extension using the outjar parameter, the resulting jar file should contain the necessary MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps: 1. Call ajc with the sourceroots option and provide an output file with a .jar extension using the outjar parameter. 2. Inspect the created jar file and observe that it does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file."}
