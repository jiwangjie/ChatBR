{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path displayed incorrectly in declare warning for binary files", "description": "Bug 37021 - When targeting .class files from injars, the source path displayed in the declare warning messages is in the format 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. This issue can be reproduced by running the code in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory. It is important to note that these tests may produce false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it seems that if the filename doesn't make sense, AJDT simply omits it.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is incorrectly displayed as 'app.Main.class'. Occasionally, the filenames may not appear at all, but these tests do not replicate that problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be displayed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "1.
