{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131 - ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using version 1.1rc1 of ajc (AspectJ compiler). This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter executing the above command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe compiled class should be placed in the existing \"subpackage\" directory, without creating the additional \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage as described above.\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java"}
