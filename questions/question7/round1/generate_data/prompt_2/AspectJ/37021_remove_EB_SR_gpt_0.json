When using declare warning messages to target .class files from injars, the source path is displayed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has been observed that in some cases the filenames do not appear at all in the declare warning messages.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'. I have also seen cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the source path in declare warning messages should be displayed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'. Additionally, the filenames should always appear in the declare warning messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. folder.\n2. Execute the code to see the problem.\nNote: The tests may produce false positives as filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. It is possible that AJDT omits certain filenames if they make no sense to AJDT."}
