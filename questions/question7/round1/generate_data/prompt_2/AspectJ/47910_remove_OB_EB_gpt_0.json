{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The issue occurs when using the 'ajc' command to create a jar file. The generated jar file does not contain a 'MANIFEST.MF' file, even when there is a 'METAINF/MANIFEST.MF' file inside the source directory.", "OB": "When running the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar', an output file with a '.jar' extension is created. However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because the 'MANIFEST.MF' file is missing.", "EB": "When running the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar', the generated jar file should contain the 'MANIFEST.MF' file from the 'METAINF' directory inside the source directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a terminal or command prompt \n2. Navigate to the desired directory \n3. Run the command: 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar' \n4. Check the generated jar file for the presence of the 'MANIFEST.MF' file inside the 'METAINF' directory in the source directory."}
