However, the exception list still comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. The expected behavior is either for the cancellation request to be honored, or for the cancel button to be disabled. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to false.", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately upon clicking cancel.
