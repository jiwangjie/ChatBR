Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.", "EB": "When I type 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' since 'dispose()' is a better match.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open Build 204\n2. Write SWT code\n3. Type 'button.dispose'\n4. Observe the automatic code assist list"}
