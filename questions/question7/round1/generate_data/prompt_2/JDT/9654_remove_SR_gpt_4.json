{"id": "9654", "title": "Bug 9654: Modify Parameters - Dialog Details", "description": "When modifying parameters in the dialog, the following issues have been observed:\n\n- There is a duplicated name validation that could be performed on the first page.\n- The first and second columns could be merged.\n\n", "OB": "- The buttons are too small.\n- When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n- When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n- The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.\n\n", "EB": "- The marking between the button and the list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top.\n- The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n- Multiple selection should be allowed, as the move up/down functionality can be applied to more than one item.\n- The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.\n\n", "SR": ""}
