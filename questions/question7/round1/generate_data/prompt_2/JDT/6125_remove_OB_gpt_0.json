{"id": "6125", "title": "Bug 6125 - JAR packager reports open files very late", "description": "When I press the 'Finish' button in the JAR packager, I receive the error message 'JAR creation failed: Unsaved Editors'.", "OB": "The JAR packager does not allow me to create a JAR file if there are unsaved editors. I have to quit the wizard, save my changes, open the wizard again, and then re-enter all the fields.", "EB": "I should be allowed to create a JAR file even if there are unsaved editors. If there are unsaved changes, a dialog should appear asking if I want to save them before creating the JAR file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a file and make changes without saving.\n2. Open the JAR packager for the project containing the file.\n3. Enter all the required information such as path, destination, name of JAR packager, description, etc.\n4. Click on the 'Finish' button."}
