{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When I press Ok after setting the output location and classpath in the IDE, I receive the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. It seems that setting the output location and classpath separately results in an illegal state.", "EB": "The IDE should offer a way to set the classpath and output location as a single operation, similar to the validation process where both classpath and output location are checked together. Additionally, the error message should be improved to state '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the IDE and navigate to the project settings.\n2. Set the output location and classpath separately.\n3. Press Ok and observe the error message received.'"}
