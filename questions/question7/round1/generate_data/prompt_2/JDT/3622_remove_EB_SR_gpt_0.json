{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has a confusing message. When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard, before typing anything, a message appears at the top saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. The package name field is empty at this point. It is unclear what this message means and whether it is an error. If it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. Notes: - EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM): There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. - MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM): It is a warning. I will remove the message. - EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM): Issue: How to create a default package? It can't be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard, before typing anything, a message saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' appears at the top.
