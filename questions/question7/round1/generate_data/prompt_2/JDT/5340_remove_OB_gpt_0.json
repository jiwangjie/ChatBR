{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The progress dialog should honor the cancellation request when adding an exception breakpoint. Alternatively, the cancel button should be disabled during the process. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the 'cancellable' parameter.", "SR": "1) Open the Eclipse IDE and switch to the debug perspective. 2) Go to the breakpoints pane. 3) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception breakpoint. 4) In the progress dialog that appears, click the cancel button."}
