Additionally, the tab character in the first line should be replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same. It is currently confusing as to why the text does not shift.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n    - First line: space\n    - Second line: tab, followed by some text\n    - Third line: tab, followed by some text\n3. Highlight the first two lines.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n\nExpected result: The second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the first space character. Additionally, the tab character in the first line should be replaced with spaces.\n\nActual result: The text does not shift."}
