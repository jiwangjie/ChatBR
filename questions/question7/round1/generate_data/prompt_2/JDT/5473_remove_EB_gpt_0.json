{"id": "5473", "title": "ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Build 200110251\n\nWhen attempting to use the ShiftLeft feature with intermixed tabs and spaces, the behavior is not as expected.\n\nOB: In a default text editor, when the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, and then ShiftLeft is executed, the text does not move. This is confusing because it is unclear why the text won't shift.\n\nEB: The expected behavior is that when executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (removing the tab). In the described scenario, the text should shift as expected.\n\nSR: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following (using the appropriate number of spaces for indentation):\n\t- Line 1: some text\n\t- Line 2: some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute the ShiftLeft command.\n4. Observe that nothing moves as a result of the ShiftLeft command being executed.\n\n"}
