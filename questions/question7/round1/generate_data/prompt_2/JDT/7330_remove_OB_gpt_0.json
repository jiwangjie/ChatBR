I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal preference, which should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without the need to switch views.", "OB": "When selecting text in the editor, the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in any menus or contexts.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the Edit menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text in the editor.\n3. Open the Edit menu and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available."}
