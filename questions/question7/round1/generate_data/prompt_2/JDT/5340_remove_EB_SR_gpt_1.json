{"id": "5340", "title": "Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. After the dialog closes, the exception list appears as expected, ignoring the cancellation request. The expected behavior is that either the cancellation request is honored, and the exception breakpoint is not added, or the cancel button is disabled during the process. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancellable parameter.", "OB": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately.", "EB": "The progress dialog should remain open until the cancellation request has been processed.
