I had to switch to the Outline view to access it. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal taste. This should be changed. Users should be able to access all actions from the editor, either in the context menu or through a global menu like 'Edit'.

If not, try accessing it through the 'Edit' menu."}
