{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste rather than being easily accessible to users. It is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view just to access certain actions.", "OB": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' when selecting text.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available when selecting text.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available.\n5. Switch to the Outline view.\n6. Repeat steps 2-4.\n7. Verify that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is now available."}
