{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking.", "EB": "The code assist should prioritize matching the method name 'dispose()' instead of selecting 'DISPOSED' automatically for completion.", "SR": "1. Open Build 204.\n2. Write SWT code.\n3. Type 'button.dispose' and observe the code assist behavior."}
