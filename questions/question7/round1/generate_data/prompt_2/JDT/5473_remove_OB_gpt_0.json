When executing the ShiftLeft function on lines that contain a combination of tabs and spaces, the behavior is unexpected. The text does not shift as expected, causing confusion for the user. It is unclear how this behavior is supposed to be specified.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following lines:\n    - <space>\n    - <tab>some text\n    - <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute the ShiftLeft function.\n\nObserved Behavior (OB):\n- Nothing moves after executing the ShiftLeft function.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB):\n- The second line should be shifted left and the first line should also be shifted left, at least to the space character (i.e., the tab should be discarded).\n\nSteps to Reproduce (SR):\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type the following lines:\n    - <space>\n    - <tab>some text\n    - <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute the ShiftLeft function.\n4. Observe that nothing moves."}
