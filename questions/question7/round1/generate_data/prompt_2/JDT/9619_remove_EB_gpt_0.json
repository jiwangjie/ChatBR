Mnemonics are missing.\n\nb. There is no validation on the type field. It should be checked for existence, as this can be done efficiently.\n\nc. The browse button is too small. It should be resized to match the standard button sizes using SWTUtil.\n\n d. The title is used for long text, which results in a confusing message when navigating to the next page. Instead, a clear message like 'Type not found' should be displayed.\n\n e. The displayed types in the dialog include types from the source folders of other projects, which should not be shown. Only types from the source folders of the current project should be available in the dialog.\n\nf. The destination type can be set as a source type. However, refactoring warns that this will result in errors, which is incorrect. The warning creates pseudo changes in all referencing classes.\n\nThe bug report lacks the expected behavior (EB) statement. Please add it.", "OB": "1. The browse button is smaller than standard button size.\n 2. The title displayed when navigating to the next page says 'Type not found'.\n 3.
