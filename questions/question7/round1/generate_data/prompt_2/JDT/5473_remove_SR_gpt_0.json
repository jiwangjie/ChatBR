It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in this scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). However, in the current behavior, the text does not shift, making it confusing to understand why it won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually, executing ShiftLeft should move the text as follows: the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). In the current behavior, the text does not shift, making it confusing to understand why it won't shift.", "SR": "1. Open the text editor.\n2. Insert a tab character in the first line.\n3. Use spaces for indentation in the second line, ensuring that both lines are visually indented the same.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n5. Observe the text and note that it does not move as expected."}
