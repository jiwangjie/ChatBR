{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok after changing the project properties, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. By setting the first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
