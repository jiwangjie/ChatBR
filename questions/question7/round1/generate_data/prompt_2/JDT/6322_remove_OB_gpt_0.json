{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes. JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc. They appear prominently in the dialog.", "OB": "Currently, in the All types dialog, the obfuscated classes appear alongside other classes without any distinction or filtering.", "EB": "The obfuscated classes should be less prominent or filtered out completely to improve the usability of the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the All types dialog. Notice the presence of obfuscated classes alongside regular classes. To resolve this, I suggest either a) sorting the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter, or b) filtering out the obfuscated classes completely."}
