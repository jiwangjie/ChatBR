{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When setting the classpath and output location, it should be possible to do it in one operation, rather than separately. The error message displayed when attempting to do this is also unclear and should be improved.", "OB": "There is no observed behavior provided in the bug report.", "EB": "When setting the classpath and output location, the user should be able to do it in one operation. Additionally, the error message should be more informative and should state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
