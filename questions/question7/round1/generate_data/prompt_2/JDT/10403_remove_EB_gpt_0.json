{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow the steps below: 1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. 2. Specify the output folder as a bin directory. 3. Proceed with the project creation and observe that there is no confirmation message confirming the ability to delete and rebuild the output directory."}
