{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following:\nbutton.dispose\nAt this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now:\nDISPOSED\nintWidget.dispose()\nvoidWidget\nI then type \"(\" because the line I was typing was supposed to be:\nbutton.dispose();\nBut as soon as I type the \"(\", then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "After typing \"button.dispose\", the code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and suggest \"dispose()\" instead of \"DISPOSED\". If there are multiple suggestions, the code assist should show them to me and let me choose the appropriate one.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor in Build 204.\n2. Start typing \"button.dispose\".\n3. Note that the code assist list appears.\n4. Without looking at the code assist list, type \"(\".\n5. Observe that the code assist automatically inserts whatever is selected instead of suggesting the appropriate completion based on the '(' character.\n6. Expected behavior: The code assist should suggest \"dispose()\" based on the '(' character."}
