The error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as separate operations. As a result, setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Go to project properties. \n3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
