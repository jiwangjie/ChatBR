{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even though the package name field is empty. It is unclear what this message means and if it is an error. Additionally, it is suggested that if this is an error, the message should be displayed in red with the error icon. Further, it is noted that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled until a valid package name is entered. It is also mentioned that there is an issue regarding creating a default package, as it cannot be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard with an empty package name field, a message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new Java project.\n2. Select the project.\n3. Invoke the New Java Package wizard."}
