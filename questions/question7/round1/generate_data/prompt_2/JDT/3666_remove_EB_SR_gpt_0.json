{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the IDE is consuming more code than expected. This issue is illustrated in the following example:\n\nThe code is changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nInstead, it should have been:\n\nbaz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the enclosed class.\n2. Navigate to the bar method.\n3. Observe that the code assist feature automatically completes the code to baz(x.foo().foo()) instead of the expected baz(x.foo(), x.foo()).\n4. Manually modify the code to baz(x.foo(), x.foo()) to make the program correct.\nThe expected behavior is that the code assist feature should provide the appropriate code completion and not consume more code than necessary.", "OB": "The code is changed to: baz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me: baz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n void bar(X x) {\n baz(x.foo());\n }\n\n int foo() {\n return 5;\n }\n\n void baz(int i, int j) {\n }\n}", "EB": "The code should be changed to: baz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n void bar(X x) {\n baz(x.foo(), x.foo());\n }\n\n int foo() {\n return 5;\n }\n\n void baz(int i, int j) {\n }\n}", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1.
