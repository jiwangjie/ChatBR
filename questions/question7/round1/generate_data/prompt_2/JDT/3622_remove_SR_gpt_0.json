{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a message appears at the top saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even though the package name field is empty. This message is confusing and it is unclear whether it is an error. It should be clarified whether this is intended behavior or an error, and if it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. Additionally, there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled in this case. It is also unclear how to create a default package, as it cannot be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before entering any text in the package name field, the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' appears at the top.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before entering any text in the package name field, no message about a folder existing should be displayed.

The process for creating a default package should be clarified, as currently it is not possible for the user to create it.", "SR": "1. Open the New Java Package wizard.\n2. Do not enter anything in the package name field.\n3. Observe the message at the top and check if it says 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.\n4.
