{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When trying to set the classpath and output location separately, the system allows the user to set them independently.", "EB": "The system should combine the setting of the classpath and output location into a single operation for convenience. Additionally, the error message should be improved to state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the system settings. \n2. Navigate to the classpath settings and attempt to set a classpath. \n3. Then, navigate to the output location settings and set an output location. \n4. Observe that the system allows you to set them independently."}
