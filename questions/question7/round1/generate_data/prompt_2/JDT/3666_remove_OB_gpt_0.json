{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion: Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature eats too much code. For example, consider the enclosed class:\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}\n\nAs a programmer, I must add a parameter to the `baz` call in `bar` to make the program correct.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Change the `baz` call to `baz(x.x.foo())`\n2. Place the cursor after the first `x.`\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist\n4. Type `f` to filter the list\n5. Select `foo()`", "OB": "The code assist feature is adding an extra `foo()` after `x.foo()` in the `baz` call.", "EB": "The code should only add `x.foo()` in the `baz` call, without the additional `foo()`. The code should be changed to `baz(x.foo())`.", "SR": "1. Change the `baz` call to `baz(x.x.foo())`\n2. Place the cursor after the first `x.`\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist\n4.
