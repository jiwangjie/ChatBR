{"id": "6009", "title": "Bug 6009 - New class wizard doesn't set correct context for nested classes", "description": "When attempting to create a new class using the new class wizard, the context for nested classes is not correctly set. The field for 'Enclosing Type' is blank, when it should default to the current type in the editor.", "OB": "With Build 20011106, when a .java file is open in the editor, clicking the new class button and checking 'Enclosing Type', the field is blank.", "EB": "The 'Enclosing Type' field in the new class wizard should default to the current type in the editor, rather than being blank.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open a .java file in the editor. 2. Click the new class button. 3. Check the 'Enclosing Type' option. 4. Observe that the field is blank instead of defaulting to the current type in the editor."}
