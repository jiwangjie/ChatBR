{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member - Dialog details", "description": "The bug report is requesting the following improvements for the 'Move static member' feature of the application:\n\na. Mnemonics\nb. No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for super class), so it could be done.\n\nc. At least isValidTypeName\n\nd. The label could say 'Select destination type:'\n\ne. I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'\nf. Selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "OB": "The bug report does not provide any information about the current behavior of the 'Move static member' feature.", "EB": "The expected behavior after the mentioned improvements are implemented is as follows:\n\na. Mnemonics should be added.\nb. The type field should be validated to ensure its existence.\nc. isValidTypeName should be implemented and used.\nd. The label for the type selection dialog should be changed to 'Select destination type:'.\ne. The title should be used for 'Move static field(s)' and the description should be used for 'x fields from xx'.\nf. The selection dialog should be initialized with the currently entered type.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug and view the suggested improvements, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the application.\n2. Go to the 'Move static member' feature.\n3. Observe the absence of mnemonics.\n4. Enter a value in the type field without validation.\n5. Observe that the validation is not being performed.\n6. Check if isValidTypeName is implemented.\n7. Observe if the label of the type selection dialog says 'Select destination type:'.\n8. Check if the title is used for 'Move static field(s)' and the description is used for 'x fields from xx'.\n9. Verify that the selection dialog is initialized with the type currently entered."}
