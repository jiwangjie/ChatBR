{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing Ok after making changes, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that the process of setting the output location and classpath is divided into two separate operations. This creates an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. In the project properties, change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
