{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to consider matching parentheses", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with `button.DISPOSED` which isn't what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again. Code assist should recognize that I have typed a '(', and that this matches 'dispose()' better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(', and automatic code assist seems to insert whatever item is selected.", "EB": "When I type 'button.dispose(', the automatic code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Launch the application Build 204.\n2. Open the code editor and start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. Observe that the code assist list appears with options: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget.\n4. Continue typing '(' immediately after 'dispose'.\n5. Check if the automatic code assist suggests 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'."}
