{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the ability to delete and rebuild bin directory", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory (bin) can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we do not confirm whether the output directory (bin) can be deleted and then rebuilt.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory (bin) can be deleted and then rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. When selecting the output folder, choose a bin directory which contains more than just .class files. \n3. Complete the project creation process. \n\nExpected result: The system should prompt the user to confirm the ability to delete the output directory (bin) and rebuild it."}
