{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "The New Package Wizard displays a confusing message when the package name field is empty. This message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. It is unclear what this message means and if it is an error. Additionally, it is suggested that if this is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. It is also noted that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Lastly, the user raises a question on how to create a default package, as it cannot be created by the user since it is always there.", "OB": "When creating a new Java package, the following confusing message appears at the top if the package name field is empty: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "When creating a new Java package, if the package name field is empty, there should be no error message displayed and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.
