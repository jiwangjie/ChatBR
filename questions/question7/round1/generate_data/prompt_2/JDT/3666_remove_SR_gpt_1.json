{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature eats too much code. When adding a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method, the code assist should only replace the necessary portion of the code. However, it replaces more code than necessary.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a class similar to the enclosed class:\n\npublic class X {\n  void bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo());\n  }\n\n  int foo() {\n    return 5;\n  }\n\n  void baz(int i, int j) {\n    // code implementation\n  }\n}\n\n2. Invoke the code assist feature when adding a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe code assist should only replace the portion of the code that needs to be modified, without replacing more code than necessary.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nThe code assist replaces more code than necessary.\n\nAdditional Information:\n- The text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure.\n- An option to control the amount of source to replace was added and then removed later.\n- The choice between replacing until the end or until the cursor location should be conditioned by a keystroke (e.g. enter = replace until end, insert = replace until cursor location).\n\nNote: This bug report has been moved to ITPJUI.", "OB": "The code assist replaces more code than necessary.", "EB": "The code assist should only replace the portion of the code that needs to be modified, without replacing more code than necessary.", "SR": "Invoke the code assist feature when adding a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method.
