Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the super class) and could be done here as well. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g. ", "OB": "When going to the next page, the title is used for long text and it says 'Type not found'. The Browse button is too small. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type can be the same as the source type, but the refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": ""}
