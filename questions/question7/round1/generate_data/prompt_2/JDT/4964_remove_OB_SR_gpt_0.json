{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "When using the automatic code assist feature, I encountered an issue. After typing 'button.', the code assist suggested 'DISPOSED' as the first option, which I accidentally selected. This resulted in incorrect code being inserted - 'button.DISPOSED'. To fix this, I had to manually delete the incorrect code and type it again. It would be helpful if the code assist feature could recognize that I have typed a '(' and suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED', as it is a closer match. Alternatively, the code assist feature could also be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "The automatic code assist suggests 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()' when typing 'button.'.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' when typing 'button.'.", "SR": "1.
