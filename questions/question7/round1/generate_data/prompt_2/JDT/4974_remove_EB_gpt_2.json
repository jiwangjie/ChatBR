This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are currently two separate operations. Setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after attempting to set the output location and classpath, an error message appears stating 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Go to the project properties and change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
