In the given scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, removing the tab. However, if there is a stray space, it is confusing as the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character with spaces, the two lines should be indented the same visually. When executing the ShiftLeft function, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left until the space character (removing the tab). There should not be any difficulty in shifting the text.", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft function.\n3. Verify that the second line is shifted left and the first line is shifted left until the space character."}
