{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "The ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces is not functioning as expected in build 200110251. When the tab character is replaced with spaces in the first line so that both lines are indented the same visually, and then ShiftLeft is executed, the text does not move. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in this scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). Additionally, having a stray space in the first line makes it confusing as it prevents the text from shifting properly.", "OB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.

Type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n   Now highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.\n3. Notice that nothing moves."}
