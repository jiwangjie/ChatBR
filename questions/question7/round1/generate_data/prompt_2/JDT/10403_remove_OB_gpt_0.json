{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files. These additional files cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "The bug report does not provide any details about the observed behavior.", "EB": "The output directory should be confirmed to be deletable and rebuildable. Specifically, the bug report suggests that we should ensure the bin directory only contains .class files and can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. When prompted to select the output directory, point it to a bin directory. \n3. Confirm that the output directory can be deleted. \n4. Rebuild the output directory by compiling the available .java files."}
