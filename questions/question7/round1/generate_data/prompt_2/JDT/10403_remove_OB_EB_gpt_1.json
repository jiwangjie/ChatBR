Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, the build process does not give any warning or confirmation message.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, the build process should display a warning or confirmation message, informing the user that the bin directory will be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n3.
