The first and second columns could be merged.", "OB": "a. The buttons are too small. b. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled. c. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off. g. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. c. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. d. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up/down can be applied to more than one item. f. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover. h. The buttons should be more clearly visible.", "SR": ""}
