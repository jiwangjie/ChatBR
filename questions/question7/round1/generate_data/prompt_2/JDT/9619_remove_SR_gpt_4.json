It is not too expensive to check for the existence of the type (as it is already done in the type wizard for the super class), so it could be implemented.\n\nAt least isValidTypeName\n\nf. The label could say 'Select destination type:'\n\ng. The browse button is too small. It should use SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\n\nc. The title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\n\ne. The destination type can be the same as the source type. Refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nI would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'.\n\nd. Selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Open the move static member dialog.\n2. Try to move a static member to a non-existent type.\n3. Observe that there is no validation on the type field and it allows you to proceed.\n4. Go to the next page and observe that it says 'Type not found'.\n5. Observe that the browse button is too small.\n6. Observe that types from other projects are shown in the dialog.\n7. Try to move a static member to the same type it is currently in.\n8. Observe that refactoring warns of errors and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.\n9. Observe that the move static field(s) dialog does not use the title for its text.\n10.
