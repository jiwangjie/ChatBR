{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose(). Then, I type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: 'button.dispose();'. But as soon as I type '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "When typing 'button.dispose()', the code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()'.", "SR": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, follow these steps to reproduce the issue: 1. Type 'button.dispose' 2. Do not realize that the code assist list is up because you are not looking. 3. Observe that the code assist list contains 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()'. 4. Type '(' 5. Observe that the automatic code assist inserts whatever is selected."}
