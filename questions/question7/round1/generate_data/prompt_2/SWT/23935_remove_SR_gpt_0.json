{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. However, on Linux, the text widget does not lose focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This behavior causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When running the attached code with build 20020920, both the left tree and text should behave as they should on Windows and Linux.", "SR": ""}
