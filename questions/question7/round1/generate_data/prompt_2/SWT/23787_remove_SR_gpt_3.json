Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms (such as Solaris, AIX, HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them appear as user input targets. Additionally, these fields have different colored backgrounds on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, which further emphasizes them.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should be replaced with readonly Labels. This way, their values can still be selected and copied by the user, but they won't look like editable input fields.", "SR": ""}
