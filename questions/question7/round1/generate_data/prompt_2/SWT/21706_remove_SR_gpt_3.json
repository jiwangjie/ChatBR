The specific issue is that the method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This causes a problem in the CLDC version of SWT if jxeLink or similar tools are used.\n\nIt is also mentioned that this issue is not caught by the eclipse compiler or Sun's compiler.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, it is suggested to add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in the class, it is considered a good practice to make the constructor private to prevent unnecessary instantiation. This change will not add any size to the class as the compiler already provides a free public constructor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Verify or use jxeLink or a similar tool that triggers the issue.\n3. Compile and run the application.\n4. Observe the NoClassDefFoundError caused by the usage of Class.forName() in BidiUtil."}
