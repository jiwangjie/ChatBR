This issue occurs when attempting to revert the changes made to a file.", "OB": "When opening an editor for the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository and making changes to the file, the revert operation takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "The revert operation should complete much faster, preferably within a comparable time as the close and reopen approach (around 8 seconds).", "SR": "1) Open an editor for the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Make changes to the file, for example, add a space character at the end of the first line, to mark the file as dirty.\n3) Close the editor by clicking on the close box in the editor tab and choose 'no' when prompted to save changes.\n4) Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it and verify that the changes made are no longer present.\n5) Repeat steps 1 and 2.\n6) Instead of closing and reopening the editor, select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n7) Observe the time it takes to replace the contents of the window with the original. The operation should complete in a much faster manner than 15 seconds."}
