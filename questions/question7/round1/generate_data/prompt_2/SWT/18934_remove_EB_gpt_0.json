However, when you try to move them, they don't have any effect. This issue is particularly noticeable when opening a small image, such as an icon, where the scrollbars are misleading as they don't perform any action.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example on the system.\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect.\n4. To further emphasize the problem, open a small image such as an icon and see that the scrollbars don't actually do anything."}
