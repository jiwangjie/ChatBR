We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree does not lose focus.", "EB": "Build 20020920: When you run the attached code, the left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux, where the tree loses focus when you click anywhere in it.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Click anywhere in the tree. The tree should lose focus."}
