{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace function, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "The behavior of Find/Replace should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to enter and perform the full range of find and replace operations. Furthermore, the feature should respect the case of what the user types.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document so that the Edit > Find/Replace... option becomes available. 2. Enter a value in the Find field or the Replace With field. The entered value should not be replaced with a value from the history as it currently happens."}
