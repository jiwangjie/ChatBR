However, if I repeat these steps and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file contents. This delay seems odd, as reverting the file contents should not take longer than simply closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "When I select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file contents.", "EB": "Reverting the file contents should not take more time than closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1.
