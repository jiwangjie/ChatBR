{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets (tree and text) are children of the shell. The issue occurs only on Windows. A potential solution is to create the text editor as a sibling of the tree and move it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree, which leads to platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "To reproduce the bug, please run the attached code using build 20020920. On Windows and Linux, the left tree and text widgets should behave correctly.", "SR": ""}
