The BidiUtil class in org.eclipse.swt.internal package has a line of code which uses Class.forName() to create a Callback object. However, this causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT. The bug report suggests a code change to remove the reflection and use a different approach.", "OB": "Currently, the BidiUtil class in the win32 version of SWT uses Class.forName() to create a Callback object. This causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "The suggested code change is to modify the line of code in BidiUtil.java to: static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); This change should achieve the same functionality without using reflection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use the CLDC version of SWT and verify the BidiUtil class. The NoClassDefFoundError should be thrown. To fix the issue, change the line in BidiUtil.java to the suggested code and verify that the NoClassDefFoundError is no longer thrown."}
