Currently, when the Delete button is pressed, the first item on the second row is deleted, but the second row is also removed. This is causing a layout corruption. The expected behavior is that the second row should remain when the delete occurs. Additionally, when the delete occurs, the Launch item is moved to the first row. The expected behavior is that the Launch item should stay on the second row.", "OB": "When the Delete button is pressed, the first item on the second row is deleted and the second row is also removed from the Coolbar layout.
