{"id": "17993", "title": "Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature in the F1 build is that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches for entries from a previous search and replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete commonly found in browsers. However, it would be better if what is typed is not replaced with a value from the history. In the future, it would be more useful to have a full autocomplete feature. Currently, this behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "OB": "In the F1 build, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit->Find/Replace...), if there is a matching entry in the history of recent searches, what is typed gets replaced with the value from the history. Additionally, the search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what is typed may be changed to match the value in the history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog, the application should not replace what is typed with a value from the history. It should allow the user to input their own search or replacement value without interference from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch the application and go to Edit->Find/Replace...\n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. You will notice that the typed value is replaced with the matching entry from the history instead of allowing you to type your own value."}
