This behavior seems odd since reverting the file contents should not take longer than simply closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "When attempting to use the 'Revert' option in the Java editor, the process takes significantly longer to complete. The file does eventually revert, but the operation is noticeably slower than expected. The delay in reverting the file contents is affecting my productivity.", "EB": "When using the 'Revert' option in the Java editor, the file should revert to its previous contents within a reasonable amount of time, similar to closing and reopening the file. The revert operation should complete in a timely manner, allowing for smooth and efficient code editing.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a Java file in the editor.\n2. Make some modifications to the file.\n3. Right-click on the file and select 'Revert' from the context menu.\n4. Observe the time it takes for the file to revert to its previous contents.\n\nExpected Results:\n The file should revert to its previous contents within a reasonable amount of time, similar to closing and reopening the file.\n\nActual Results:\nThe revert operation takes significantly longer to complete compared to closing and reopening the file, affecting productivity."}
