Create a StyledText widget with word wrap mode enabled.\n2. Append N lines to the StyledText widget.\n3. Observe the redraws occurring for the entire client area.\nExpected Result: There should be only one redraw for the entire client area, regardless of the number of lines appended. You can add the following line of code to StyledText.performPaint method to see the redraws occurring: System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);"}
