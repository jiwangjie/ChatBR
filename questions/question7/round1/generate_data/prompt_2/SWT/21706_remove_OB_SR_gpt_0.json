{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 should have a private constructor", "description": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 currently has a usage of Class.forName(). The suggested fix is to add a private constructor. There are no nonstatic methods in this class, so it would be beneficial to prevent people from instantiating the class if there's no need to. This change does not add any size, as the compiler provides a free public constructor. It simply makes the constructor private instead of public.", "OB": "The current behavior of BidiUtil in win32 is not specified in the bug report.", "EB": "After applying the suggested fix, BidiUtil in win32 should have a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instantiation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 module.\n2. Look for the usage of Class.forName() in the code.\n3. Verify that there is a public constructor present.\n4. Apply the fix by adding a private constructor instead of the public constructor.\n5. Build and test the application to ensure that the BidiUtil class behaves as expected with the private constructor."}
