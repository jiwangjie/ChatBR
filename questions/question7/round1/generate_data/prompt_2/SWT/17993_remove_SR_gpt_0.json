{"id": "17993", "title": "Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature is replacing what I type with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers, but it is causing issues when I try to perform find or replace operations. I believe the behavior should be changed to allow the full range of find and replace operations, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Alternatively, the feature can be temporarily removed until a more suitable solution is implemented.", "OB": "When using the F1 build, the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the feature searches for entries from previous searches. If a matching entry is found, it replaces the text that has been typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of the typed text may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. It should allow the user to perform find and replace operations without altering the text they have typed. The search of the history should respect the case of what the user types. This change will ensure that the feature is more suitable for performing various find and replace operations.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document so that the Edit > Find/Replace... option becomes available. 2. Enter some text in either the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field. 3. The feature should not replace the typed text with a value from the history. It should allow the user to proceed with find or replace operation using the text they have typed. The behavior should respect the case of what the user types."}
