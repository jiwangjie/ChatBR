{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The problem occurs on Windows. To work around the issue, we can create the text editor as a sibling of the tree and move it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when clicking on the tree. This is a problem because the text widget is a child of the tree. This is causing platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When running the attached code with build 20020920, the left tree and text should behave correctly on Windows and Linux.", "SR": ""}
