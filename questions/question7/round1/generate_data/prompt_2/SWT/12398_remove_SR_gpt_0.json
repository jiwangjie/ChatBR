{"id": "12398", "title": "Bug 12398 Accessibility problems", "description": "When launching the Help view, the tab key does not function until a 'live' area is clicked on (e.g., the banner with tool buttons, the navigation frame, or the content frame). We need to ensure that the Help view is accessible via keyboard navigation from the moment it is launched.", "OB": "When I launch the Help view on Windows 2000 on March 26, 2002, the tab key does not have any effect.", "EB": "The Help view should be immediately navigable using the tab key after launching.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch the Help view. 2. Press the tab key and observe that it does not actively navigate within the Help view. 3. Click on one of the 'live' areas mentioned above (e.g., the banner with tool buttons, the navigation frame, or the content frame) and then try pressing the tab key again. Note that it should now navigate within the Help view."}
