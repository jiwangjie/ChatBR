After making changes to a file and marking it as dirty, the time it takes to perform 'Revert' is much longer compared to closing the file and reopening it.", "OB": "After marking the file as dirty, the following steps are observed: 1) Clicking on the close box in the editor tab. 2) Choosing 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. 3) Double clicking on the file in the navigator to reopen it. When using this sequence of steps, it takes about 8 seconds to reopen the file. However, if the steps 1) and 2) are repeated, and then the 'Revert' option is selected from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. 2) Make a change by selecting the end of the first line and inserting a space character, marking the file as dirty. On a fast machine, it takes about 8 seconds to perform the following steps: 3) Click on the close box in the editor tab. 4) Select 'no' when prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. 5) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.
