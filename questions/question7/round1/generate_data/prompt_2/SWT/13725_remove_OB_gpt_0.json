{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor", "description": "When comparing the time it takes to revert a file with closing and reopening it in the java editor, it is observed that the revert operation is significantly slower. This behavior seems unusual because reverting the file contents should not take longer than closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "When selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the java editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file.", "EB": "It is expected that the revert operation should take a similar amount of time or less compared to closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets project.\n2. Navigate to the source folder and open the 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' file in the java editor.\n3. Make a change to the file so that it becomes dirty.\n4. Close the file by clicking on the close box in the editor tab and select 'No' when prompted to save changes.\n5. Reopen the file by double-clicking on it in the navigator.\n\nObserve that the file is closed and reopened relatively quickly.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-4 to make the file dirty again.\n7. Right-click on the editor window and select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu.\n\nObserve that it takes significantly longer (approximately 15 seconds) to replace the contents of the window with the original file."}
