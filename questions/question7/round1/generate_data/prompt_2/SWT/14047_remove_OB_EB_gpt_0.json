Create a StyledText component with word wrap enabled.\n2. Append or remove text content in the StyledText component.\n3. Observe that the component performs multiple unnecessary redraws, causing the user interface to flicker.\n\nTo debug and verify the number of redraws occurring during text changes, add the following line to the performPaint method in the StyledText class:\nSystem.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);"}
