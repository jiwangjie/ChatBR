{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "Integration build 09/17. The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields as it looks bad on all motif platforms. On Windows, it appears fine, but on motif, these text fields all get automatic borders, which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different-colored backgrounds, making them stand out much worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page displays text fields with automatic borders, indicating that they are user input targets. On Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different-colored backgrounds.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should display read-only text fields instead of input fields. This will prevent the automatic borders from appearing on motif platforms and eliminate the different-colored backgrounds on Solaris/AIX/HPUX.", "SR": ""}
