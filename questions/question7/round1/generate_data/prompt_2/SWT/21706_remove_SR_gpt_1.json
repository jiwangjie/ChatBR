{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706: BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 version of SWT is using Class.forName() in a line of code. However, this is causing a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT which does not define this exception. This problem can only be seen when using jxeLink or a similar tool. To resolve this issue, a private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class to prevent unnecessary instantiation.", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 version of SWT has a line of code that uses Class.forName() which causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "A private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no non-static methods in the class, there is no need for it to be instantiated. This change will not increase the size of the class as the compiler provides a default public constructor.", "SR": ""}
