The issue is that the tab key does not work as expected and does not allow me to navigate through the Help view using the keyboard.", "OB": "When I launch the Help view, the tab key does not allow me to navigate through the view using the keyboard.", "EB": "The Help view should be accessible and navigable via the keyboard immediately after launching, without requiring the user to click on any specific areas.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch the Help view. 2. Attempt to navigate through the view using the tab key. Observe that the tab key does not work as expected and does not allow for keyboard navigation."}
