{"id": "14047", "title": "Bug 14047: StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap", "description": "The description of the bug is missing.", "OB": "", "EB": "The expected behavior is that there should be a maximum of one redraw for each visible line. Currently, there are more redraws happening than necessary during a text change with word wrap enabled. This causes inefficient redraws and impacts performance.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:\n1. Enable word wrap in the StyledText component.\n2. Make a text change that affects multiple lines.\n3. Observe the number of redraws that occur. There should be more redraws than there should be visible lines."}
