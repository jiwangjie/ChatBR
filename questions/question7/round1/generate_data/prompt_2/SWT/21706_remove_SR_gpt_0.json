{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "OB": "The bug is related to a line of code in the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class. The line declares a static Callback object with a constructor that uses Class.forName(). This causes a problem in the CLDC version of SWT because it throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries.", "EB": "To fix this issue, a private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it would be beneficial to prevent people from instantiating the class unnecessarily. Adding a private constructor does not increase the size of the class, as the compiler generates a free public constructor by default.", "SR": ""}
