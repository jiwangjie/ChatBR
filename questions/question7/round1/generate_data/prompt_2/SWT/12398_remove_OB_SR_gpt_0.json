This is causing accessibility issues as the Help view should be navigable via the keyboard from the beginning.", "OB": "When accessing the Help view, I need to click on one of the \"live\" areas before it starts working.", "EB": "The Help view should be starting in a way that can be immediately navigated using the keyboard.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1.
