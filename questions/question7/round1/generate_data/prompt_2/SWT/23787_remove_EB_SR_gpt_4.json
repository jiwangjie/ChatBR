The appearance of the Project Properties Info page is not consistent across different platforms. On motif, the text fields display automatic borders that make them appear as user input targets. On Solaris/AIX/HPUX, the text fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more. This inconsistency in the appearance of the text fields needs to be addressed.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets.
