{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "Integration build 09/17. The Project Properties Info page is currently using text fields, which results in a bad visual appearance on all motif platforms. On Windows, the appearance is fine. However, on motif platforms (such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX), these text fields have automatic borders that make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, these text fields have different colored backgrounds, which make them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms (such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets.
