The Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog should not use text fields.

Additionally, these text fields have different colored backgrounds on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, making them stand out even more.", "OB": "On motif platforms (Solaris, AIX, HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page of the Properties dialog have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets.
