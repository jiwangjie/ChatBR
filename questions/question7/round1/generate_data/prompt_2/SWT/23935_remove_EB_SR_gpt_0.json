{"id": "23935", "title": "Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the Tree widget and the Text widget are children of the shell. The issue is only observed on Windows. To work around this issue, we can create the Text editor as a sibling of the Tree and move it above the Tree. ", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the Tree widget, the Tree gets focus. However, on Linux, the Text widget never loses focus when you click on the Tree. This issue occurs because the Text widget is a child of the Tree widget. This behavior is causing the platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that clicking anywhere in the Tree widget should not cause the Tree to gain focus, regardless of the platform. The Text widget should be able to maintain focus independently. Additionally, the issue reported in platform UI bug 2470 should be resolved.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a window with a Tree widget and a Text widget as children. \n2. Click anywhere in the Tree widget. \n\nExpected behavior: The Tree widget should not gain focus. The Text widget should maintain focus regardless of where the user clicks in the Tree widget. \n\nNote: This issue is currently only observed on Windows. To reproduce the issue on Linux, refer to platform UI bug 2470."}
