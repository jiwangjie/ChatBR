Integration build 09/17. The current design looks fine on Windows, but on motif platforms, such as Solaris, AIX and HPUX, the text fields have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, the fields have different colored backgrounds, which stand out even worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page displays text fields instead of labels.
