{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text widget does not lose focus when you click on the tree. This is causing platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus while the text widget loses focus.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run the application containing the text widget and tree on Linux.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gains focus while the text widget does not lose focus."}
