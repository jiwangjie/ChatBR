{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is slower than close and reopen in Java editor", "description": "When performing a revert operation in the Java editor, it takes significantly longer compared to closing and reopening the file. This issue occurs when the user answers 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog and then double-clicks on the file in the navigator to reopen it. However, if the user repeats these steps and selects 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "OB": "Perform the following steps:\n1. Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n2. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.\n4. Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe contents of the window should be replaced with the original almost instantly, similar to the behavior when closing and reopening the file.\n", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
