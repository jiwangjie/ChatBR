Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it would be better to prevent people from instantiating the class if there is no need to. This doesn't add any size because the compiler already provides a free public constructor. The only change needed is to make the constructor private instead of public.", "SR": "To address this issue, modify the code by changing the line above to: 'static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), 'windowProc', 4);'. Although it hasn't been tested, it is expected to perform the same functionality as before."}
