{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of Find/Replace is such that if a user types in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from the history of recent searches. If it finds a match, it automatically replaces what the user has typed with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is commonly found in browsers. However, it would be better if the typed entry is not replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered.", "OB": "I am using the F1 build. When using the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...), the history of recent searches is consulted. While typing in either the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the search for entries from the history occurs. If a matching entry is found, the value the user has typed is replaced with the value from the history. Additionally, the search of the history is case-insensitive, meaning that the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. Consequently, in some scenarios, it becomes impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "The behavior should be updated so that the typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. The case sensitivity of the search should also be maintained to ensure consistency. This would allow users to accurately conduct find and replace operations without interference.", "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the application and access the Find/Replace dialog through Edit -> Find/Replace...\n2. Enter a value in either the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field.\n3. Observe if the typed entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history.\n\nNote: It may be necessary to have some previous search entries in the history in order to reproduce this issue."}
