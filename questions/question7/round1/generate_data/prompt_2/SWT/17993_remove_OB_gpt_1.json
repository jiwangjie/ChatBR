{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace should not replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if the text I type in the Find/Replace fields is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior resembles an autocomplete feature found in browsers, but I believe it should be more versatile to allow for a full range of find and replace operations. It should also respect the case sensitivity of the user's input. Until this is implemented, I think the feature should be removed from the application. \n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a document to make the Edit > Find/Replace... option available.\n2. Click on Edit > Find/Replace...\n\nThe same behavior can be observed in the 'Replace With' field as well.", "OB": "When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches for entries from a previous search. For example, if you search for 'hello' and replace it with 'hi', and then try to search for 'Hello' and replace it with 'Hi', it is not possible.", "EB": "The behavior should be changed so that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application does not automatically fill in suggestions from previous searches. The feature should be able to handle a wide range of find and replace operations, while respecting the case sensitivity of the user's input. Until this is implemented, the 'Find/Replace' feature should be disabled.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a document to make the 'Edit > Find/Replace...' option available.\n2. Click on 'Edit > Find/Replace...'\n3. In the 'Find' field, type 'a'.\n4. Click 'Find'.\n5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. "}
