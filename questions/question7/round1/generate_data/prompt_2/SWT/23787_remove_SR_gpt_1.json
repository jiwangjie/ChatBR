The Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog should not use text fields. It looks fine on Windows, but on Motif platforms (Solaris/AIX/HPUX), these text fields are displayed with automatic borders which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On Motif platforms (Solaris/AIX/HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders and different colored backgrounds, making them look like user input targets and stand out prominently.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should be created as readonly fields or labels instead, so that their values can be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": ""}
