{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "Currently, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches for entries from a previous search history and automatically replaces what is being typed. This behavior is similar to 'autocomplete' commonly found in browsers. However, it would be better if the application did not replace what is being typed with a value from the history. In the future, it would be ideal to have a full 'autocomplete' feature provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application automatically searches for entries from the previous search history and replaces what is being typed.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application should not automatically replace what is being typed with a value from the previous search history.", "SR": "1. Open the application and go to the 'Find/Replace' feature.\n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field and observe the behavior."}
