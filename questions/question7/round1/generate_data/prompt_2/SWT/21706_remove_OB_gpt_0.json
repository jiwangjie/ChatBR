{"id": "21706", "title": "BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 package uses Class.forName() to retrieve the Class object for the BidiUtil class.", "EB": "To improve code readability and prevent unnecessary instantiation, add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, making the constructor private is a good practice. This change does not increase the size of the class file, as the compiler automatically generates a public constructor. Instead, it ensures that the class cannot be instantiated by others when there is no need to do so.", "SR": "To implement the suggested change, modify the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); Although the change has not been tested, it is expected to have the same functionality as the original code."}
