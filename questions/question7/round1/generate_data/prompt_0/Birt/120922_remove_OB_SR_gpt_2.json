Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. A dialog with the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' is shown, where 'Yes' would save the changes, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page. In addition, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "The current behavior is that when the source of the XML Report Design is changed, other pages cannot be accessed until the changes are saved. A dialog with the title 'Error' is shown, asking the user if they want to save the changes. The dialog also includes the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog with a more appropriate title that does not include quotes. The dialog should clearly indicate that the XML Report Design has been changed and prompt the user to either save or discard the changes. The options presented should be more descriptive, such as 'Save', 'Discard', and 'Cancel' instead of just 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, make changes to the XML Report Design in the editor and attempt to navigate to other pages. The dialog with the inappropriate title and options should be displayed."}
