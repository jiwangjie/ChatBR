{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, however I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers shows every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being displayed. Even though there is a schema filter, a warning message is displayed on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should only load the tables and columns in the selected schema (catalog) when they are requested, instead of loading all the tables and columns on page load.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform. 2. Use the JTOpen JDBC drivers. 3. Observe that the tree control shows every schema (catalog) on the system and loads all the tables and columns on page load. 4. Apply a schema filter to reduce the number of displayed tables. 5. Note that a warning message is still displayed on load, indicating that the tree is being populated on load."}
