However, after the data has been extracted, the labels are recognizable strings.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for IMetaData.getColumnLabel() to return recognizable strings even before data extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() before data extraction and observe the returned labels. Then, extract the data and call IMetaData.getColumnLabel() again to compare the labels before and after extraction."}
