{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When including a library in a report design, the report design is currently storing the absolute file path. For example, the property \"fileName\" is set as \"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\". Additionally, the property \"namespace\" is set as \"lib1\".", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test and a library is included from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the BIRT designer. 2. Create or open a report design located in a specific directory. 3. Include a library from a different directory. 4. Verify that the relative path is generated and saved for the included library in the report design."}
