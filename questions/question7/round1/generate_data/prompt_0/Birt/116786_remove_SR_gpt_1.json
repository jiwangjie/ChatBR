{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path", "description": "", "OB": "The current behavior of the software is that the report design stores the absolute path for library includes. For example, in the XML representation of the report design, the path is specified as 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located at '$project/test', the path should be saved as '$project/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design or open an existing one.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design and observe how the path for the library is stored."}
