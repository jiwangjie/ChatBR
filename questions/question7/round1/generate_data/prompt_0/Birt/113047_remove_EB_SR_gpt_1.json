After creating a new dataset without an SQL statement and selecting a new data source that lacks database/table/column information, the issue is observed. The expected child nodes are missing.", "EB": "When changing the data source for a dataset in the dataset editor page of the query tab, the expected behavior is to display the children nodes associated with the selected data source. The child nodes should be listed based on the database/table/column information available in the chosen data source.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new dataset without specifying an SQL statement.\n2. Choose a data source with no database/table/column information.\n3. Open the dataset editor page of the query tab.\n4.
