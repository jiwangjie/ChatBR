{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More better logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is border value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for processing disk sorting when there is a border value for the row value is not efficient. It is causing slow performance and potential data loss. The system is currently sorting the data directly on the disk, which leads to frequent read and write operations.", "EB": "A more optimized logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is a border value for the row value. Instead of performing the sorting directly on the disk, a better approach would be to sort the data in memory and then write it to the disk. This will improve the overall performance and reduce the risk of data loss.", "SR": "1. Copy the file to the destination folder.\n2. Update the logic to sort the data in memory.\n3. Write the sorted data back to the disk."}
