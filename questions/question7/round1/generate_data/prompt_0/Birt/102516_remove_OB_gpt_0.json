{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes some time to load. Eventually, an error message saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The load of the table and column information should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the delay in loading the entire schema and the subsequent error message. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema."}
