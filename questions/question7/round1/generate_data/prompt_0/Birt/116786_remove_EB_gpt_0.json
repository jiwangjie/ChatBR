{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "In the report design, the property 'fileName' stores an absolute path for the included library, instead of a relative path. For example, the absolute path stored is 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design.\n3. Include a library by specifying its absolute path, for example, 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Check the property 'fileName' for the included library, it should store a relative path instead of an absolute path."}
