The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system. This can easily be several hundred tables. However, when using the code from CVS from 6/30/05, I noticed that even with the schema filter, the tree control is still being populated on load and I receive a warning message.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
