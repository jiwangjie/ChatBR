It should not return the wrong result or null result set.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Set a filter in the data set with the expression 'row[0] equals to 0'.\n2. Click on the Preview tab.\n\nActual result: The first result record is returned when previewing the data set.\n\nExpected result: The data set should not consider 'row[0]' as a valid filter expression since it can only be generated after all the data is fetched. Therefore, it should return the correct result and not the first result record."}
