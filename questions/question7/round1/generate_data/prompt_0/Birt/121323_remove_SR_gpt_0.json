{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression includes a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior is problematic because XPath expressions are treated in a way that can lead to trouble.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should allow the use of plain XPath expressions (with the path from the data set selector prepended) and should persist the filter information. Additionally, filtering should be treated as an optional feature for those who need it.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression that includes a selection part, for example: 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Verify that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Open the file and check if the RelationInformation data is persisted and the filter information in filterInfo HashMap is retained."}
