{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores an absolute path for the library include. The property 'fileName' in the XML contains an absolute path: 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the report design to store the relative path instead of the absolute path. The 'fileName' property should reflect a relative path, ensuring portability and flexibility across different environments.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design that includes an external library.\n2. Examine the XML structure and locate the 'fileName' property within the 'library' element.\n3. Note that the 'fileName' property contains an absolute path. This behavior needs to be corrected to store the relative path instead."}
