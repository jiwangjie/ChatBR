{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer does not generate a relative path for the library inclusion.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and store the relative path for library inclusion in the report design.", "SR": "To reproduce:  \n1. Open the BIRT designer.  \n2. Create or open a report design.  \n3. Include a library by navigating to $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.  \n4. Save the report design.  \n5. Close and reopen the report design.  \n6. Verify that the library inclusion still uses the full absolute path instead of a relative path."}
