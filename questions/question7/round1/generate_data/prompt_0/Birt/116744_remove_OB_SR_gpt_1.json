The content is not being displayed as expected.", "EB": "I expect the report to display different results based on the dynamic text element's Content Type property. \nFor Plain, I expect the literal content (tags and all) to be displayed. \nFor Auto, I expect the content to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags. \nFor HTML, I expect specific content to appear properly without HTML tags, and other content to appear literally with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the attached report. \n2. Set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Plain. \n3. Verify that the literal content is displayed, including any tags present. \n4.
