The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "Currently, the table and column data is loaded immediately when the JDBC Data Set Editor page is opened.", "EB": "The table and column data should be loaded on demand, meaning it should not be loaded until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query. \n2. Notice that the tables and columns are immediately loaded without any user action. \n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter and observe if the table and column data is loaded at that point."}
