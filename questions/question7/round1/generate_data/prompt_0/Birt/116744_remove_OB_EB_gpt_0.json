{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "The dynamic text element is not displaying the correct content type for the field with three types of content: HTML text within <html>...</html> tag, HTML fragments not within <html> tag, and text with RTF tags.", "OB": "The dynamic text element is not differentiating between the different types of content in the field and is displaying the content as plain text, regardless of the content type.", "EB": "The dynamic text element should recognize the content type of the field and display the content accordingly. HTML text within <html>...</html> tag should be rendered as HTML, HTML fragments not within <html> tag should be rendered as plain text, and text with RTF tags should be rendered with proper formatting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set up a database field with three types of content: HTML text within <html>...</html> tag, HTML fragments not within <html> tag, and text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field.\n3. Observe that the dynamic text element does not render the content according to its content type."}
