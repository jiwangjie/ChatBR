{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More Robust Logic Needed for Disk Sorting with Border Row Values", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting on disk with a dataset of 40000 rows and configuring the program to process data less than 40000 rows, the current logic exhibits unexpected behavior.", "EB": "The system should effectively handle disk sorting operations, especially when dealing with datasets that include a border value for row count. The sorting process should reliably execute without encountering issues or unexpected outcomes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Sort data on disk with a dataset of 40000 rows.\n2. Configure the program to process data less than 40000 rows.\n3. Observe the steps taken by the system, including saving the file as a temp file, calling the file to memory, sorting the data, and saving the file again as a temp file."}
