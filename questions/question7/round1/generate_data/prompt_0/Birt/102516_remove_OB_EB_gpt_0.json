{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand instead of querying the entire schema at once. It should not show the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the wait time while querying the entire schema and the resulting message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Refer to [Bug 101372](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372) for the requested ability to filter based on schema."}
