{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. The code from CVS dated 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query loads all schemas (catalogs) on the system, resulting in a warning message. The tree control is populated on load, causing performance issues.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter, thereby improving performance and eliminating the warning message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, launch the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers. Note the warning message and the loading time for the tree control listing all schemas. The issue should be observed consistently."}
