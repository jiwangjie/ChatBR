{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "The report displays the same results regardless of the dynamic text element's Content Type property. Whether set to Auto, Plain, or HTML, the content is not displayed correctly.", "EB": "For the Plain content type, the literal content (including tags) should be displayed. For the Auto content type, the content 1, 2, and 3 should appear properly without any HTML or RTF tags. And for the HTML content type, content 1 and 2 should appear correctly without HTML tags, while content 3 should appear with the literal RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a database field with three types of content:\n   - HTML text within <html>...</html> tags.\n   - HTML fragments not within <html> tags.\n   - Text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field."}
