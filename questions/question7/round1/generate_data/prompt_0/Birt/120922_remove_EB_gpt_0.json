However, the error message does not provide clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes. Additionally, the dialog is titled 'Error'.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. This problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes or discard them, which is even more difficult. The error message is 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, the user should receive a clear error message that clearly indicates the need to save or discard changes. The dialog title should be informative and not simply 'Error'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the XML Report Designer. 2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view. 3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view. 4. Observe the error message and dialog behavior."}
