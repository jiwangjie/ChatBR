{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient logic needed for disk sorting when there are border values for row data", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for disk sorting processes data in a suboptimal manner when there are border values for row data. It does not sort the data directly in memory, leading to performance issues.", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to be implemented for disk sorting when there are border values for row data. The data should be sorted directly in memory before being written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Set the program to process the data less than 40000, while sorting on disk.\n2. Save the file as a temporary file.\n3. Load the file into memory.\n4. Sort the data directly in memory.\n5. Save the sorted data to the temporary file."}
