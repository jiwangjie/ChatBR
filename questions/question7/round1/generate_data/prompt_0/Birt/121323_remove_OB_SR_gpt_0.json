{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When using the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information does not persist after closing and reopening the dialog. This means that any filters applied to the data set are lost upon reopening the dialog.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should retain the filter information even after it is closed and reopened. This will allow users to easily reuse previously applied filters without the need to reapply them every time they open the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Apply any filters to the data set.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n\nExpected: The previously applied filters should still be present.\nActual: The previously applied filters are not retained and need to be reapplied every time the dialog is opened."}
