{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not retain filter information. When an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the filterInfo data is lost. This behavior can cause issues because XPath expressions should not be treated this way.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', for the column mapping.\n3. Leave the dialog and observe that the filter information is not persisted."}
