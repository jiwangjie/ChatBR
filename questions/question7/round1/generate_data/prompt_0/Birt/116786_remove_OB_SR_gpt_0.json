{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer currently generates and saves the absolute path instead of the relative path. For instance, if my report design is in $project/test, the absolute path is being stored.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. In the provided example, if the report design is in $project/test, the stored path should be relative to that location.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Include a library in a report design.\n3. Save the report design in a specific directory, for example, $project/test.\n4. Observe that the library inclusion results in storing the absolute path instead of the relative path."}
