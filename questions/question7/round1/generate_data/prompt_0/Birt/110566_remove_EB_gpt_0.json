{"id": "110566", "title": "Bug 110566: Wrong data set result returned when setting an invalid filter expression row[0]", "description": "When setting a filter expression like 'row[0] equals to 0', the result set is returned incorrectly or null.", "OB": "When setting a filter expression 'row[0] equals to 0' and clicking on the Preview tab, the first record of the result set is returned.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that row[0] should not be used as a filter expression since it can only be generated after fetching all the data. Therefore, the result set should not be affected by invalid filter expressions using row[0].", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Set a filter in the data set with the expression 'row[0] equals to 0'. \n2. Click on the Preview tab and observe the returned result. "}
