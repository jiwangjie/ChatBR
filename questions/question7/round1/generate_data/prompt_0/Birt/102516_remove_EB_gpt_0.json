{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily amount to several hundred tables. Despite the presence of the schema filter in the code from 6/30/05, a warning message is still displayed indicating that the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should only load the necessary schemas, tables, and columns when requested, instead of loading the entire schema on load. This would improve performance and avoid displaying the warning message about only being able to view 500 items in the available list.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor. 2. Notice that the entire schema is queried and the warning message appears. 3. Request the ability to filter based on schema as requested in Bug 101372: [Bug 101372 - Ability to filter based on schema](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372)"}
