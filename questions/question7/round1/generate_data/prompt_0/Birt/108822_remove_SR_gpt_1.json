{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient disk sorting logic needed for border row values", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk, if there are 40000 rows and the program is set to process only a subset of the data, the following steps are performed:", "EB": "A more efficient logic should be implemented to handle sorting of data on disk when there are border row values. Instead of processing the data partially, it should directly sort the data in memory and then write it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Prepare a dataset with 40000 rows of data. \n2. Set the program to process only a subset of the data. \n3. Initiate the sorting operation on disk. \n4. Observe the performance and behavior of the sorting process."}
