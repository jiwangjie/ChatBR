{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "Entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', in the XML Edit Data Set dialog results in the selection being stripped off within the class RelationInformation. The stripped selection is then stored in the filterInfo HashMap. Upon leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information, including XPath expressions with selection parts, such as 'section[@id='left']'. The filterInfo HashMap should retain this information even after leaving the dialog. Treating XPath expressions in this manner is expected to work without losing data.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Note how the selection is stripped off within the class RelationInformation and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog and observe that RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
