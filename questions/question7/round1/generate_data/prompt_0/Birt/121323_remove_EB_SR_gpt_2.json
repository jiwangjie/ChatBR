{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the class RelationInformation. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way may lead to potential issues.", "OB": "Entering an XPath expression for column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' results in the selection being stripped off and stored in filterInfo HashMap. However, upon leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information entered for the XPath expressions. The data stored in filterInfo HashMap should not be lost when leaving the dialog, ensuring that RelationInformation retains the necessary information in .rptdesign.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for column mapping with a selection part (e.g., 'section[@id='left']').\n3. Observe the stripping of the selection and storage in filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check if RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data in filterInfo is lost."}
