{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with opened, dirty .txt file and the user shuts down Windows, the changes made in the .txt file are lost without any warning or prompt to save.", "EB": "The system should display a warning or prompt to save any unsaved changes in the .txt file before allowing the user to shut down Windows.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nExpectation: \nA warning or question message box should be displayed, giving users a chance to save their dirty model(s) before the computer is shut down/rebooted."}
