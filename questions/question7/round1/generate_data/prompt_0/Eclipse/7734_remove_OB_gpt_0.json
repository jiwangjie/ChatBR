{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.", "EB": "The system should provide a \u201cDo you want to save your file\u201d dialog box with options for Yes, No, and Cancel. Selecting Yes should save the file and continue with the shutdown process, selecting No should continue with the shutdown process without saving, and selecting Cancel should halt the shutdown process and allow the user to stop the shutdown. Additionally, it would be helpful if applications could control the shutdown/save process or display their own windows that would also give the user the option to stop the shutdown if Cancel is selected.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected results: A 'Do you want to save your file' dialog box should appear, giving users a chance to save their dirty .txt file before the computer is shut down/rebooted."}
