{"id": "14197", "title": "Removing a working set immediately applies changes", "description": "When a working set is removed, the changes are immediately applied. This issue needs to be addressed to prevent unintended changes when deleting a working set.", "OB": "The changes made in the working set are instantly applied without any confirmation or prompt.", "EB": "The changes made in the working set should not be applied immediately upon removal. Instead, the user should be prompted to confirm the deletion and have the option to keep or discard the changes.", "SR": "To reproduce:  \n1. Create a working set with one project and select it. Notice that the package view is filtered.  \n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set.  \n3. Delete the first working set."}
