{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always match the width of the property sheet column. Additionally, it should behave the same way as DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. It needs further investigation to determine if the issue originates from our code or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Set the width of the property sheet column.\n3. Add a ComboBoxCellEditor to the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box does not size correctly and does not match the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Compare the behavior with DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible, to see the difference."}
