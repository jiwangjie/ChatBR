There should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench, since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "1. Launch Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3.
