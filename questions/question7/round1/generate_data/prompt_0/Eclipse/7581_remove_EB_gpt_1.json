{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in Property Sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. When a string in the editor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to the width of the largest item. Consequently, the drop-down button may extend beyond the visible area of the property sheet, getting clipped.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should handle wider strings gracefully, ensuring that the drop-down button remains within the visible area of the property sheet. Users should not need to widen the property sheet view to access the combo drop-down button.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object with ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n3. Include strings in the editor wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe the drop-down button position, possibly extending beyond the visible area."}
