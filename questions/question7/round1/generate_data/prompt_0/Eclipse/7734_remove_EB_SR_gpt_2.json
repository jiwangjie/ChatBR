There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty files before the computer is shut down or rebooted.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Start WSWB and create a new project. \n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. \n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. \n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down or reboot the computer. \n\nExpected behavior: \n- Users should receive a warning or question message box asking them to save their dirty files before the computer is shut down or rebooted."}
