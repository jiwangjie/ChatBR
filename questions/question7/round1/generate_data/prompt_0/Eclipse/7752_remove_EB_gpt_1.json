Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and select 'Zip File' to export\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (such as 'test.zip'), and begin export to zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up indicating problems encountered during export, with the detail listing the file of the same name in project 2 as the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file should successfully create the zip file without any error messages.", "OB": "Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails.
