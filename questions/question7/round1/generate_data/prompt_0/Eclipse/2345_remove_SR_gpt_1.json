Then, 'Default Text Editor' is selected. The expected behavior is that a new editor is opened for the file. However, nothing happens and the existing editor, which is the scripted resource editor example, is reactivated.

This ensures that the correct editor type is used for the file. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new basic project. \n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml' in the project. \n3. Select 'test.xml' in the Navigator. \n4. Right-click on 'test.xml' and choose 'Open With...' \n5. From the list of editors, choose 'Default Text Editor'. \n6. Note that nothing happens and the existing editor for 'test.xml' is reactivated, instead of opening a new editor in the selected 'Default Text Editor'."}
