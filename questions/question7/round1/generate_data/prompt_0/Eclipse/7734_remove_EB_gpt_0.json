{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.)", "EB": "When the user attempts to shut down the system while there are unsaved changes in WSWB, the system should display a warning or question message box, giving the user a chance to save their dirty model(s) before proceeding with the shutdown/reboot process.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down...' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected result: A warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their unsaved changes in WSWB before proceeding with the shutdown/reboot process."}
