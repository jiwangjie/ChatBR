The icon has also changed from the parent Java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "The file is saved without a file extension, and the icon displayed is a generic file icon instead of the original Java file icon.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original, unless explicitly changed. The icon should remain the same as the original Java file icon.", "SR": "1) Open an existing Java file.\n2) Modify the file (e.g., move an existing class).\n3) Click the 'SaveAs' icon, located next to the 'Save' icon.\n4) A dialog box will appear.\n5) Browse for a valid container location.\n6) Type the filename but ignore the extension, as it isn't requested.\n7) Click 'Ok'.\n\nObserve that the Navigator has added the file to the specified location, but no file extension is shown and the icon displayed is a generic file icon."}
