However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. This behavior does not occur in build 20011116 on Nt2000. If the icons start moving around, it can confuse users.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Launch build 20011127 on Linux.\n2. Open a view such as the Navigator.\n3. Resize the view smaller.\n4.
