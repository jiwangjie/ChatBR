Reproducing the steps in 1GEWMOZ: 1. Start with a new basic project. 2. Create a new file called test.xml. 3. The scripted resource editor example is set as the default editor for XML files. 4. Select test.xml in the Navigator. 5. Choose 'Open With...' and select 'Default Text Editor'. The expected behavior is that a new editor is opened for the file since the editor type is different. However, nothing happens and the scripted resource editor example is reactivated.", "EB": "When opening a file with a different type of editor while the file is already open, a new editor should be opened for the file, taking into consideration the editor types.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1.
