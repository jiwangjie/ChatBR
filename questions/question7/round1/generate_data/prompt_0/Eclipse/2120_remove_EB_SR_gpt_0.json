{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120 - MRU File List is not persisted between sessions", "description": "The bug report is about the MRU (Most Recently Used) file list not being persisted between sessions in the software. The reporter noticed that files appear in the MRU list during the current session but are not present in the list in subsequent sessions. It is mentioned that these files should be persisted between sessions. The note suggests using IPersistableElement and not peeking into the underlying implementation to get the resource.", "OB": "The files that are accessed during the current session are appearing in the File menu MRU list. However, when the user starts a new session, those files are no longer present in the MRU list.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the MRU file list should persist between sessions. The files accessed in previous sessions should continue to appear in the MRU list in subsequent sessions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:1. Launch the software.2. Access multiple files during the session.3. Check the File menu MRU list.4. Close the software.5. Launch the software again.6. Check the File menu MRU list."}
