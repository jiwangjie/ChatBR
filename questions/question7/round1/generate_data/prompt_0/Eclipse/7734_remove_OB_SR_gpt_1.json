{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "The system can be shut down without displaying any warnings or prompts to save files.", "EB": "The system should provide a dialog box with options to save the user's file, allowing them to choose between Yes, No, or Cancel. Selecting Cancel should halt the shutdown process. It would be beneficial to allow applications to control the shutdown/save process or have the ability to display their own windows to allow the user to stop the shutdown if they choose Cancel.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform a normal system shutdown without saving any open files. Verify that no warning or prompt is displayed to save the files before the shutdown process completes."}
