The existing editor remains active and unchanged.", "EB": "When attempting to open a file with a different type of editor while the file is already open, the system should recognize the editor type and open a new editor window for the file with the specified type.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open the scripted resource editor example.\n2. Create a new basic project in the editor.\n3. Create a new file called 'test.xml'.\n4. Select 'test.xml' in the Navigator.\n5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...'\n6. From the options, select 'Default Text Editor'.\n7. Observe that nothing happens and the scripted resource editor example remains active.\n\nExpected Result: Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types. Therefore, opening a file with a different editor should open a new editor window for the file with the specified type."}
