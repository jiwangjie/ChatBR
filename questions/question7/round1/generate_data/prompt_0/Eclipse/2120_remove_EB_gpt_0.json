{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120: MRU File List is not persisted between sessions (1GE71Z0)", "description": "", "OB": "When starting the workbench, notice that the files that were previously opened do not appear in the File menu MRU (Most Recently Used) list. However, when opening 2 or 3 files and then shutting down the workbench, the files do appear in the MRU list while the workbench is still running. The problem is that these files are not persisted between sessions.", "EB": "The MRU File List in the File menu should include all files that were previously opened, even after restarting the workbench. The list should be persisted between sessions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start the workbench. \n2. Open 2 or 3 files. \n3. Shutdown the workbench. \n4. Restart the workbench. \n5. Check the File menu MRU list to confirm that the previously opened files are no longer present."}
