{"id": "12906", "title": "Bug 12906: Unable to open file in another editor if already opened in one editor", "description": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open it in another editor does not show any response or give an error message. This behavior may be a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the software's workspace.", "OB": "1. Close the file if it is already opened in the editor.\n2. Go to the Java Perspective.\n3. Double click on a Java file to open it in the workbench.\n4. Right click on the same Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n5. No response or warning/error message is displayed to indicate a potential conflict in opening the file in multiple editors.", "EB": "When attempting to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor, the software should display a warning message informing the user about the potential overwrite of changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, asking the user to close all instances of the file before opening it in another editor.", "SR": "1. Open a file in the software's editor.\n2. Try to open the same file in another editor.\n3. Observe if any warning/error message is displayed or if the file opens without any indication of potential conflicts."}
