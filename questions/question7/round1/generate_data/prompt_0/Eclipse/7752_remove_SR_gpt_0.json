{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752: Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce:1. ", "OB": "When exporting multiple files with the same name but under different directories to a zip file, the system fails. In the 'Export' dialog window, I selected both projects created earlier, provided a name for the zip file (such as test.zip), and initiated the export to zip file process. The result was an error message box which stated that problems were encountered during export. The details of the error message indicated that the file with the same name in project2 is causing the issue (i.e., 'foo.txt' in project 2).", "EB": "The system should allow the zip file to store files with the same name under different directories. In this case, exporting files named 'foo.txt' from different directories should not cause an error.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:1. Open the 'Export' dialog window.2. Select two projects that contain files with the same name but under different directories.3. Provide a name for the zip file.4. Initiate the export to zip file process.5. Observe the error message indicating the problem with the file of the same name in project2."}
