{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view is resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When running build 20011127 on Linux, the Close button moves down when the view, such as the Navigator, is resized smaller. This behavior was not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000. Additionally, not only the tool items move below the label, but also the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). This could potentially confuse users if the icons start moving around.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run build 20011127 on Linux.\n2. Open a view, such as the Navigator.\n3. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n4. Observe that the Close button, tool items, pulldown menu icon, and close icon move down below the label."}
