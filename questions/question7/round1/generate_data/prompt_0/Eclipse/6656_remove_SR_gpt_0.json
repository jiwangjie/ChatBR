However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label.", "EB": "The tool items (such as the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) should remain on the same line as the label, regardless of how small the view gets.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Observe that the tool items (including the pulldown menu icon and the close icon) move below the label."}
