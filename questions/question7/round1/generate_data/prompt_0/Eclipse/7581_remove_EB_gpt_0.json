", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the drop-down menu is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box expands to fit the width of the widest item. However, the drop-down button may be positioned too far to the right and end up outside the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped. As a result, users cannot see the drop-down button unless they make the property sheet view wider.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the PropertySheetViewer. 2. Edit an object with row pairs in two columns. 3. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create a ComboBoxCellEditor for column two of the property sheet. 4. Ensure that one of the strings in the drop-down menu is wider than the width of the property sheet column. 5. Observe that the combo box expands to fit the widest item, but the drop-down button may be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet. "}
