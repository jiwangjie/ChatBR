This happens immediately upon deletion.", "EB": "The package view should only refilter when the working set selection dialog is closed, not during the manipulation of working sets. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to working sets, including canceling the removal of a working set.", "SR": "To reproduce:1. Create a working set with one project and select it. The package view should be filtered.2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set. Delete the first working set."}
