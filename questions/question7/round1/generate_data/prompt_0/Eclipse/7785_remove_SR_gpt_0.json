The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "1) Open an existing java file.\n2) Modify it (I moved an existing class).\n3) Click the SaveAs icon, next to the Save Icon. A dialog will come up.\n4) Browse for a valid container location.\n5) Type the filename, but ignore the extension, which isn't requested.\n6) Click Ok.\n\nObserve that the Navigator has added the file in the specified location, but with no file extension shown.", "EB": "The file is, for all intents and purposes, now a generic file, as opening it will prove. The file should be saved with the same extension as the original unless explicitly changed.", "SR": "1) Open an existing java file.\n2) Modify the file.\n3) Click the SaveAs icon.\n4) Browse for a valid container location.\n5) Type the filename without the extension.\n6) Click Ok.\n\nExpected result: The file is saved with the same extension as the original."}
