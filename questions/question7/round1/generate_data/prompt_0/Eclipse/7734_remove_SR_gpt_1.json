{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows causes the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There are no warning or question message boxes to give users a chance to save their dirty files before the computer is shut down/rebooted.", "EB": "The system should provide a dialog box with the options 'Do you want to save your file?', 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' (which halts the shutdown), allowing users to save their files before the shutdown. It would also be helpful to allow applications to control the shutdown/save process or pop up their own windows that would give users the option to cancel the shutdown.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.  \n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.  \n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.  \n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer.  \n5. Observe that there is no warning or question message box to save the dirty file before the shutdown occurs."}
