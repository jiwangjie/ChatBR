The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes).", "OB": "When creating a new file, the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\") is used. However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "The software should provide a user interface that allows the user to define the default line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch the software on a Windows workstation. 2. Create a new file. 3. Observe the line delimiter used for the new file."}
