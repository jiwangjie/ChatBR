However, this may not always be what a user wants.", "EB": "When creating a new file, the default line delimiter should always be Unix, even if the new file is created on Windows, since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench for users to define the line delimiter for new files. The UI should include the following possible values: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. It is important for all plugins to use the same line delimiter for new files, so the UI should be provided by the Workbench.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter used for the new file."}
