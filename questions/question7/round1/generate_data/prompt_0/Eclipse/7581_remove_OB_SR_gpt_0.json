{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. Instead of being the width of the property sheet column, it appears to have a smaller width. This behavior is not consistent with the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible.", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior to be that the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. It needs to be investigated to determine if this issue is specific to our software or due to the SWT framework.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Locate a cell with a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe that the combo box does not have the same width as the property sheet column."}
