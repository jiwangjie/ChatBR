{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On Linux, running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000), when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. This could potentially confuse users as these icons should maintain their relative positions when the view is resized smaller.", "EB": "Expect that when resizing a view, such as the Navigator, the tool items should adapt to the new size without causing the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) to move down. The icons should remain in their original positions relative to the view, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience.", "SR": "1. Launch the application on Linux with build 20011127. \n2. Open a view, e.g., the Navigator. \n3. Resize the view to make it smaller. \n4. Observe the behavior of the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), noting any unexpected movement."}
