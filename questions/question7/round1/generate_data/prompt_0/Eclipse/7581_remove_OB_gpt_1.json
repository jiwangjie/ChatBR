{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester, there is an issue with the sizing of the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet. The drop down button of the combo box may be clipped and not visible if any of the strings in the editor is wider than the width of the property sheet column.", "OB": "The width of the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet is not calculated correctly, causing the drop down button of the combo box to be clipped and not visible if any of the strings in the editor is wider than the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column, similar to how the DialogCellEditor works with a visible button. It should be investigated to determine if this is a bug in our code or in the SWT library.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns.\n3. Use an IPropertyDescriptor to create a cell editor, including a ComboBoxCellEditor with strings.\n4. Make one of the strings wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Notice that the drop down button of the combo box may be off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped."}
