Launch WSWB (software name) and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select 'File > Export' and choose 'Zip File' to start the export process\n4. Verify that the export fails and does not create the expected zip file."}
