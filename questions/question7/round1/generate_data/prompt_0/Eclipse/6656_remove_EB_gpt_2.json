{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When resizing a view, such as the Navigator, smaller on Linux using build 20011127 (not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000), the tool items shift below the label. However, this movement also affects the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X). This could potentially confuse users as the close button starts moving unexpectedly.", "EB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items should reposition themselves appropriately below the label, maintaining a consistent layout. The pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) should not move unexpectedly, ensuring a stable and intuitive user experience.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller dimension.\n3. Observe the tool items moving below the label, along with the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also shifting. This behavior should be consistent with build 20011127 on Linux."}
