{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly when the strings in the editor are wider than the column width. The combo box grows to the width of the largest item, causing the drop down button to be positioned off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped. As a result, users cannot see the drop down button without manually widening the property sheet view.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size itself correctly based on the column width in the property sheet. The drop down button should always be visible within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the strings in the editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects in the property sheet.\n2. Use a set of row that are name value pairs in two columns, with each column defined by an IPropertyDescriptor.\n3. Implement a method in the IPropertyDescriptor to create a cell editor, and include the ComboBoxCellEditor constructor that can be given the strings.\n4. Observe that if any of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly, causing the drop down button to be positioned off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped."}
