{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "With a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.", "OB": "When I call ajc with sourceroots <mydir and outjar <my.jar, an output file is created with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation suggests that the outjar parameter is supposed to create a zip file, but it doesn't make sense to name a parameter 'outjar' and have it create a zip file instead of a jar file.", "EB": "If the outjar parameter is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file included.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the following steps:\n1. Call ajc with the 'sourceroots' parameter set to <mydir>\n2. Include the 'outjar' parameter and specify the output file as <my.jar>\n3. Verify that the generated <my.jar> file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
