I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java. You will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. subpackage\\Test.java or javac subpackage\\Test.java. No big deal, really.", "OB": "When compiling a Java class using ajc command with the subpackage\\Test.java file as input, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "When compiling a Java class using ajc command with the subpackage\\Test.java file as input, a directory named \"subpackage\" should not be created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Run the command 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java' to compile the class."}
