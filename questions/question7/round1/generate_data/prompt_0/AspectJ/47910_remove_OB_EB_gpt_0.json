However, the generated file has a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "I expect that when using the outjar option, the resulting jar file should contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Call ajc with the sourceroots option set to <mydir> and the outjar option set to <my.jar>.\n2. Verify that the output file is created with a .jar extension.\n3. Inspect the contents of the generated jar file and confirm that it lacks a MANIFEST.MF file."}
