This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nCreate a class in a subpackage such as:\n\n```java\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen compile using the following command: `ajc -1.1rc1 subpackage\\Test.java`\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. This behavior is different from using `javac -1.1rc1 subpackage\\Test.java`. No big deal, really.", "OB": "When compiling classes from a subpackage using `ajc` command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "It is expected that `ajc` should have the same behavior as `javac` and not create a nested directory structure when compiling classes from a subpackage.", "SR": "1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile the class using `ajc` command with the appropriate options.\n3. Verify that a nested directory structure is not created and the compiled class is placed directly under the subpackage directory."}
