{"id": "11280", "title": "Bug 11280[View Mgmt] Switching perspectives loses view maximized state", "description": "", "OB": "When switching perspectives in the software, the view maximized state is not maintained. The views that were previously maximized are restored to their default size and position.", "EB": "The software should remember the maximized state of views when switching perspectives. When a perspective is switched, the views that were maximized should remain maximized.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the software and maximize a view. 2. Switch to a different perspective. 3. Note that the previously maximized view is no longer maximized and has returned to its default size and position."}
