To reproduce the issue, please run the code found in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. Limitations of the tests: These tests can produce false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, filenames that make no sense to AJDT may be omitted.)", "OB": "In the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is shown as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "In the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be displayed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code found in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' directory.\n2. Observe the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.\n3. Note that the source path is shown incorrectly as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
