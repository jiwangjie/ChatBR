See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the problem. These tests have a limitation that they might return false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in the harness verification of messages. It has been observed in AJDT that if the filename doesn't make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path appears in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are also cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests cannot reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Navigate to the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.\n2. Observe that the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
