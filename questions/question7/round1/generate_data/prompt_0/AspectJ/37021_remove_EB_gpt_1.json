{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021: Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "Bug 37021: Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files. When targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has been observed that sometimes the filenames do not appear at all in the declare warning messages. Tests available in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory can be run to reproduce the problem. However, please note that these tests may not fully reproduce the problem as they return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. It has been noticed that this issue occurs in AJDT, where AJDT simply omits the filename if it does not make sense to it.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' rather than 'app/Main'.
