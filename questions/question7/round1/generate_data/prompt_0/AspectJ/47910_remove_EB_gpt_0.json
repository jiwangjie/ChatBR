{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The current implementation of the ajc compiler in the given software does not include a MANIFEST.MF file in the generated jar file, even when there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file present.", "OB": "When calling ajc with the parameters sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, the compiler creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when using the outjar parameter in ajc, a valid jar file should be generated with a MANIFEST.MF file included.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Call ajc with the sourceroots parameter set to <mydir and the outjar parameter set to <my.jar.\n2. Check the generated <my.jar file and confirm that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
