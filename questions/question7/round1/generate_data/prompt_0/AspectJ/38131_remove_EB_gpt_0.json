This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nOB: The `Test.class` file is then placed in the `subpackage\\subpackage` directory.\n\nEB: The `Test.class` file should be placed in the `subpackage` directory, not in the nested `subpackage` directory.\n\nSR: Use the `-d .` option while compiling the classes from the subpackage to correctly place the compiled classes in the intended directory."}
