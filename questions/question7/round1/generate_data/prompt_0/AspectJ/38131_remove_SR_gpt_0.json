This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java. You will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nExecuting the java command results in an Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test. Running either of the following commands fixes the problem: ajc -d .", "OB": "The test.class is then put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory.", "EB": "But it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n\n1. Create a class file in a subpackage, for example, 'subpackage\\Test.java'\n2. Compile the class using the command 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java'\n3. Execute the java command and observe the Exception thrown\n4. Fix the problem by running 'ajc -d .' command"}
