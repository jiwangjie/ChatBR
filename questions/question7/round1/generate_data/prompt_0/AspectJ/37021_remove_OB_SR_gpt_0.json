See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main.class' instead of 'app.Main.class'", "SR": "1. Build the project.\n2. Declare a warning on a binary file.\n3. Check the source path in the declare warning message."}
