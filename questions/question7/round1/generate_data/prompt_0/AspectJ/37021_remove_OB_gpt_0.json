To reproduce the problem, run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/. Please note that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It appears that when the filename doesn't make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' rather than 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1.
