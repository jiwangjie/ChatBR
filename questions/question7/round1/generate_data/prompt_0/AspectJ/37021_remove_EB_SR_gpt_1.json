See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to reproduce the problem. These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I observed this issue in AJDT, where AJDT simply omits the filename if it makes no sense to AJDT).", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. I have also observed cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but the tests I have do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed as 'app/Main'. The filenames should always be displayed correctly.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Observe the declare warning messages for .class files from injars, and note that the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.\n3. Observe cases where the filenames do not appear at all (if possible), and note the specific scenarios where this occurs."}
