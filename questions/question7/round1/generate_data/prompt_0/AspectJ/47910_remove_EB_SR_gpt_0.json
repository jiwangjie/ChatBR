{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the parameters sourceroots <mydir, outjar <my.jar, an output file is created with a .jar extension. However, the resulting file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file as expected. The documentation for ajc mentions the option 'outjar <file' to put output classes in a zip file, but it is unclear why this option is not creating a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF.", "EB": "The outjar option should create a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file inside when specified with ajc.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Call ajc with the parameters sourceroots <mydir, outjar <my.jar. 2. Check the contents of the created jarfile to confirm whether it includes a MANIFEST.MF file."}
