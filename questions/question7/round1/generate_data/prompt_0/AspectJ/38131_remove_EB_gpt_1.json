This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac.I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlyingEclipse compiler.Create a class in a subpackage such as:\npackage subpackage;\npublic class Test {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");}\n}\nThen compile using following command: ajc subpackage\\\\Test.java\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\"directory. subpackage\\\\Test.java or javac subpackage\\\\Test.java\nNo big deal, really. ", "OB": "When compiling a class in a subpackage using ajc (AspectJ compiler), the resulting test.class file is placed in a subpackage\\\\subpackage directory. As a result, when running the java command, an exception is thrown: 'Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test'.", "EB": "The test.class file should be put in the subpackage directory instead of subpackage\\\\subpackage directory, so that running the java command does not result in a 'NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test' exception.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Compile the class using the command 'ajc subpackage\\\\Test.java'.\n3. Run the java command on the compiled class."}
