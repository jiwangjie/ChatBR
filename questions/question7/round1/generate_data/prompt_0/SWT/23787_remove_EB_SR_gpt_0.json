Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page uses text fields that have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which further worsens the appearance.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page on motif platforms should not use text fields. Instead, it should use a different UI element that does not have automatic borders and is visually consistent with the rest of the page.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Project Properties Info page on a motif platform.\n2. Observe the appearance of the text fields with automatic borders and colored backgrounds."}
