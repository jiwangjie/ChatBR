This error is not defined in the CLDC class libraries and leads to a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. The issue is not caught by the eclipse compiler or Sun's compiler.", "EB": "The reflection usage in BidiUtil needs to be removed to avoid the NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, compile and run the CLDC version of SWT using class libraries that do not define NoClassDefFoundError. Verify or use jxeLink or a similar tool to see the problem manifest."}
