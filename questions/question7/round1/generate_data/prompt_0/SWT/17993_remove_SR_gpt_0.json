{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build is to replace the typed entry with a value from the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what is typed may be changed to match the value in the history. It would be better if the Find/Replace feature allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I suggest removing the feature.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields of the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...), if there are entries from a previous search in the history, the typed entry is replaced with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which can lead to undesired changes in the case of the typed entry.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to perform find and replace operations using the full range of options. The feature should also respect the case of what the user types. If necessary, the behavior should be changed to achieve this. As a temporary solution, it may be best to remove the feature until it can be improved.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document in the F1 build. 2. Access the Find/Replace dialog through Edit -> Find/Replace... 3. Notice that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the typed entry may be replaced with a value from the history."}
