{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "The right tree and text do not behave as expected and do not lose focus on Windows.", "EB": "When running the attached code in build 20020920, the right tree and text should behave as they should on both Windows and Linux, and correctly lose focus.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the attached code in build 20020920.\n2. Run the program.\n3. Observe the behavior of the right tree and text on Windows."}
