Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it is recommended to make the constructor private. This would prevent people from instantiating the class if there is no need to. It would not add any size to the class as the compiler would provide a free public constructor by default.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 platform\n2. Look for the usage of Class.forName() method"}
