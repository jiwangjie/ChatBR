{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934 - Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled. However, despite being clickable and movable, they have no effect on the image displayed. This issue is particularly noticeable when opening small images such as icons, as the scrollbars provide a false impression of scroll functionality.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled, preventing users from interacting with them while providing a more accurate representation of the scroll functionality of the image.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n 1. Launch the ImageAnalyzer example.\n 2. Observe the enabled scrollbars.\n 3. Open a small image, such as an icon.\n 4. Notice that the scrollbars can be moved, but they do not have any effect on the image."}
