{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to \"autocomplete\" which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full \"autocomplete\" feature could be provided. For me, it is very common to perform operations like this. I think the current behavior to be changed to something more simple which allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. But this should still respect the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the typed entry with a value from the search history.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to perform a full range of find and replace operations. The software should respect the case of what the user types.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open a document so that the 'Edit -> Find/Replace...' option becomes available.\n2. Click on 'Edit -> Find/Replace...'\n3. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n4. Click 'Find'.\n5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."}
