{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is common in browsers. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the current typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The software should not replace the typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields with a value from the history. It should allow users to freely type and choose any value they want.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Choose the 'Edit' menu.\n2. Select 'Find/Replace'.\n3. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n4. Click 'Find'.\n5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field, but notice that it gets replaced with a value from the history."}
