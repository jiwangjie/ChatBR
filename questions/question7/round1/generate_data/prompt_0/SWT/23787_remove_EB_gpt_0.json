Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these text fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page on motif platforms should not use text fields. Instead, it should use a different UI element or styling that is consistent with the rest of the page.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Select a Project. 2. Right-click and choose Properties. 3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (the values for Path, Type, etc.)."}
