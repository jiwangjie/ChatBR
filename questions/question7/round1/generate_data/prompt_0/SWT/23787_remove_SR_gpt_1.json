Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page display automatic borders, indicating them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should be displayed as readonly Text fields instead of Labels. This change would allow users to select and copy their values.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the Properties dialog.\n2. Navigate to the Project Properties Info page.\n3. Observe the text fields and their appearance on motif platforms, such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX."}
