The specific line is: static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4). This usage causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT because NoClassDefFoundError is not defined in the CLDC class libraries.", "EB": "The line of code using Class.forName() should be changed to: static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4). This change should have the same effect as the original code.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Verify or use jxeLink or a similar tool.\n3. Observe the NoClassDefFoundError when executing the BidiUtil code."}
