However, when selecting the 'Revert' option from the pop-up menu in the editor after making changes to the file, it takes around 15 seconds to replace the file contents with the original content.", "EB": "This behavior is unexpected since the process of reverting a file should not take more time than simply closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3) Close the file by clicking on the close box in the editor tab and choose 'no' in the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n4) Reopen the file by double-clicking on it in the navigator.\n\nTo replicate the slow revert issue:\n1) Repeat steps 1 and 2.\n2) Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n3) Observe the time it takes to replace the contents of the window with the original content."}
