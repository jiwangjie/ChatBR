I need to first click on one of the 'live' areas before it starts working (e.g. the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame).", "OB": "When the Help view is opened, it does not immediately respond to keyboard navigation. The user is required to click on one of the 'live' areas (e.g. the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame) before the Help view can be navigated using the keyboard.", "EB": "We should be starting the Help view in a way that can be immediately navigated via the keyboard. The Help view should respond to keyboard navigation without requiring the user to click on 'live' areas.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open the Help view and attempt to navigate using the keyboard. Observe that the Help view does not respond to keyboard navigation until the user clicks on one of the 'live' areas (e.g. the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame)."}
