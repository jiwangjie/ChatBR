{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934 Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "In the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not have any effect. When opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they do not actually scroll or provide any functionality.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled when opening a small image, like an icon, to avoid confusion and improve the user experience.", "SR": "To reproduce:   \n1. Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2KDE 2.2 or GTK2 only.  \n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.  \n3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved.  \n4. Open a small image, such as an icon, and observe that the scrollbars are present but do not have any effect."}
