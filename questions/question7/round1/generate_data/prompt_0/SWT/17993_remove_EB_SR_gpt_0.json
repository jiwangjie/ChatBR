{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the F1 build, the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields and there exists a matching entry from a previous search, the typed entry gets replaced with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior renders it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "The Find/Replace dialog should not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to input their desired search or replace term without interference from the history. The case of the typed entry should also remain unchanged.", "SR": "1. Open the F1 build of the software.\n2. Navigate to the Edit menu and click on Find/Replace...\n3. In the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field, type a term that does not exist in the history.\n4. Perform a find or replace operation.\n5. Note that the typed entry is not replaced with any value from the history."}
