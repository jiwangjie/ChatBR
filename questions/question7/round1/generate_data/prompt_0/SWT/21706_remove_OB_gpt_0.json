Currently, there are no non-static methods in this class. Therefore, it would be beneficial to add a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class. This change will not increase the size of the class, as the compiler already provides a default public constructor. The intention is to restrict access to the constructor by making it private instead of public.", "SR": "To address this issue, modify the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);\nPlease note that I haven't tested this change, but it should have the same effect as the current implementation."}
