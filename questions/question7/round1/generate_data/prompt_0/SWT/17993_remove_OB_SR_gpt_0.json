{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to \"autocomplete,\" which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full \"autocomplete\" feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace functionality, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Access the Edit menu and select Find/Replace.\n3. Observe that the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Perform various find and replace operations to confirm that the behavior persists.\n5. Consider removing the feature until the desired behavior is achieved."}
