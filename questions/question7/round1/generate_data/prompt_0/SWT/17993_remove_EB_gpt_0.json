{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it should not replace your typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow you to input your own text for the search or replace operation. The search of the history should be case-insensitive, but it should retain the case of what you have typed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Choose Edit > Find/Replace...\n2. Type 'a' into the Find field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the Find field. Note that it replaces the typed 'A' with the value from the history, making it impossible to perform the desired find or replace operation."}
