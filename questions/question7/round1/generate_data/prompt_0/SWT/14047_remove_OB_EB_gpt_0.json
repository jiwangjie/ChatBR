Enable word wrap in the StyledText component.\n2. Perform a text change operation.\n3. Observe the inefficient redraws occurring.\n\nAdditional debug information can be added to the code by inserting the following line in the 'performPaint' method of the StyledText component: 'System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);'"}
