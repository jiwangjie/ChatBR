{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only), the scrollbars are initially enabled. However, when attempting to use them by moving them around, it is observed that they do not have any effect. This behavior is misleading, especially when opening a small image such as an icon, where the scrollbars are redundant and do not serve any purpose.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only). 2. Notice the enabled scrollbars. 3. Attempt to move the scrollbars. 4. Observe that the scrollbars do not have any effect, even though they can be moved around."}
