{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "On build F2 (20020602) running on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), open the ImageAnalyzer example. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled, allowing users to move them around. However, it is noticed that the scrollbars do not have any effect. This becomes particularly misleading when opening a small image, such as an icon, as the scrollbars are present but do not perform any action.", "EB": "Expect the scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example to be disabled when they do not serve any functional purpose. Users should not be presented with enabled scrollbars that do not have any impact on the displayed content. The presence of scrollbars should accurately reflect their functionality, providing a clear and meaningful interaction for users.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application with build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, using GTK2 and KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only).\n2. Navigate to the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Observe the enabled scrollbars on the interface.\n4. Attempt to interact with the scrollbars and notice that they have no effect, especially when opening a small image like an icon."}
