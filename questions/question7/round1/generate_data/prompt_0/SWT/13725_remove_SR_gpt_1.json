{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is slower than close and reopen in java editor", "description": "When using the Java editor, I noticed that the 'Revert' option is much slower than closing and reopening the file. After making changes to a file, if I answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog and then double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it, the file opens quickly as expected. \n\nHowever, if I repeat the steps of answering 'no' and double clicking to reopen the file, and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original contents of the file.", "OB": "When using the 'Revert' option in the Java editor after making changes to a file, it takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original contents of the file.", "EB": "Reverting the file contents should be as fast as closing and reopening the file in the Java editor.", "SR": "1.
