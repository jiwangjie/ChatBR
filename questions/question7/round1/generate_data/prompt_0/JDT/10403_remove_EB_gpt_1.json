{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, it should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files. This bin directory cannot be scrubbed and rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the system should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt successfully, regardless of its contents. This includes cases where the output directory is pointing at a bin directory which contains files other than .class files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. 2. During project creation, specify the output directory to be a bin directory that contains files other than .class files. 3. Check if the system confirms that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt successfully before proceeding with the project creation."}
