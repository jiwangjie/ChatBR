{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473 ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that both lines are indented visually, and then the ShiftLeft operation is executed, the text moves. The behavior is currently confusing as it is not clear how the software is expected to handle the indentation. Additionally, if there is a stray space, it is not known why the text won't shift.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that in the given scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (removing the tab). The software should handle the indentation consistently and provide clear feedback when there are stray spaces preventing the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually align both lines. 2. Execute the ShiftLeft operation. Observe how the text moves and how it is unclear why the text won't shift if there are stray spaces."}
