{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "The software does not provide the ability to set the classpath and output location as one operation. Currently, users must perform two separate operations to set these values.", "EB": "The software should allow users to set the classpath and output location together in one operation. This would provide a more efficient and streamlined workflow for users.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the classpath and output location settings.\n3. Attempt to set the classpath and output location together as one operation.\n4. Observe how the software does not allow this and requires separate operations for each setting."}
