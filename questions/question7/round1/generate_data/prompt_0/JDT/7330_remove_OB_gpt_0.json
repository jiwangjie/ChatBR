{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available on text selection unless the user switches to the Outline view.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available on text selection without requiring the user to switch to the Outline view.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Select some text in the editor.\n2. Open the Edit menu and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available. If not, switch to the Outline view and check again."}
