{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The code assist feature automatically inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()' when typing 'button.dispose'.", "EB": "Code assist should recognize the '(' character and offer 'dispose()' as a better match instead of 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, the code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Have build 204 of the software.\n2. Start writing SWT code.\n3. Type 'button.dispose'.\n4. Observe that the code assist list is up, but not being intentionally looked at."}
