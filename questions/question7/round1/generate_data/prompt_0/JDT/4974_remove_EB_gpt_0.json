{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the user presses Ok, they receive the following error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue stems from the fact that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. Setting the output location first leads to an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
