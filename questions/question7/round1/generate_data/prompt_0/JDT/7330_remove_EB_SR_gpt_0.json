I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, we distribute the actions based on personal taste, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is missing from the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be included in the context menu to make it easily accessible to users.", "SR": "1. Open the software and navigate to the editor.\n2. Select a block of text.\n3. Right-click to view the context menu.\n4. Verify if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available in the context menu. If not, follow step 5.\n5. Switch to the Outline view and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is now available in the context menu."}
