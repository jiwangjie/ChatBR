{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "Upon pressing 'Ok,' an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src.' The issue arises from the separation of setting output location and classpath as two distinct operations, leading to an illegal state upon configuring the output location.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that setting the classpath and output location should be a single, cohesive operation. This would prevent the creation of an illegal state and avoid the specific error mentioned above.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Access the project properties. 3. Change the settings to use the project as both the source folder and the output location."}
