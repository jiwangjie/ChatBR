However, when searching for declarations, no results are found. It should be noted that searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly.", "EB": "When searching for declarations using the package view selection and dialog, the search should first try to get the Java element. If it fails to retrieve the Java element, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software and navigate to the package view.\n2. Select a package and open the search dialog.\n3. Perform a search for declarations.\n4. Observe that no results are found."}
