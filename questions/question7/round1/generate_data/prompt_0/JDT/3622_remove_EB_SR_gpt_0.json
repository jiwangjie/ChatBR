{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, a message is displayed at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists.' This message appears even when the package name field is empty. The user is confused about the meaning of this message and whether it indicates an error.", "EB": "The message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should only be displayed when a non-empty package name that conflicts with an existing folder is entered. If the package name field is empty, no message should appear. In case of an actual error, such as an invalid package name, an appropriate error message should be displayed with an error icon.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the New Java Package wizard.\n2. Leave the package name field empty.\n3. Observe the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' at the top of the wizard.\n\nTo create a default package, consider adding a dedicated option/button specifically for creating the default package, as it cannot be created by the user since it always exists."}
