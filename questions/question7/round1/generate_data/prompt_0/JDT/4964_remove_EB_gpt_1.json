{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "When writing SWT code in Build 204, the code assist feature does not insert the desired code. The user types 'button.dispose', but the code assist list appears and mistakenly inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. The user then types '(' to complete the method call, and the code assist inserts whatever item is selected in the list. The expected behavior is for code assist to recognize that 'dispose()' matches the user's input better than 'DISPOSED' and automatically insert the correct method. Alternatively, code assist should be case-sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, when typing 'button.dispose' and then '(' to complete the method call, the code assist incorrectly inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of the expected 'dispose()'.", "EB": "Code assist should recognize that 'dispose()' matches the user's input better than 'DISPOSED' and automatically insert the correct method call.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue in Build 204:\n1. Open the SWT code editor.\n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'.\n3. After typing '(' to complete the method call, observe that the code assist incorrectly inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.\nNote: The bug report mentions that the code assist list appears because the user is not looking. If this is a relevant instruction for reproduction, please provide additional steps or clarify as necessary."}
