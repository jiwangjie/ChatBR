{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When changing the project properties to use the project as both the source folder and output location, the classpath and output location are not updated simultaneously. The classpath remains unchanged, leading to inconsistencies.", "EB": "Expect the classpath and output location to be updated concurrently when setting the project to use itself as the source folder and output location. The changes should be applied in a single operation, ensuring consistency in the project configuration.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as both the source folder and output location."}
