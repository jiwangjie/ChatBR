{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project, the software should prompt for confirmation if the specified output directory is set to a bin directory. This confirmation should ensure that the bin directory can be safely deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software and navigate to the project creation wizard.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure for the project.\n3. Specify a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Proceed with the project creation.\n5. Observe if there is a prompt or confirmation message about deleting and rebuilding the bin directory."}
