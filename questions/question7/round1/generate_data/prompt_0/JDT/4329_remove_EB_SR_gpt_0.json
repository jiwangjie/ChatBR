The Search dialog is initialized with the fully qualified name of the package, which is not found when searching for declarations. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly.", "EB": "When searching for declarations using the Package view selection and dialog, the search should first try to get the Java element. If the retrieval of the Java element fails, the search should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the package view\n2. Select a package\n3. Right-click and choose 'Search...' from the context menu\n4. In the Search dialog, select 'Declarations'\n5. Enter a search query\n6. Click 'Search'"}
