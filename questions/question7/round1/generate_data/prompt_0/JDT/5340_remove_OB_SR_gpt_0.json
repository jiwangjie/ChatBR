{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to add an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately without taking any action.", "EB": "The progress dialog should honor the cancellation request when adding an exception breakpoint. Alternatively, the cancel button should be disabled to indicate that cancellation is not supported. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to false.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Open the application and navigate to the breakpoint settings. 2) Click on the 'Add Exception Breakpoint' button. 3) As soon as the progress dialog appears, click on the 'Cancel' button. 4) Observe that the exception breakpoint is still added to the list, despite the cancellation request."}
