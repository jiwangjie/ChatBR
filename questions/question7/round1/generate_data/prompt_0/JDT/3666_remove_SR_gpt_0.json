UI can decide whether it wants to use the codeassist end position (until the end of the current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, so as to control the amount of source to replace. Removing codeassist option. ", "OB": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature replaces more code than expected. For example, in the given class, when calling the method `baz` in the `bar` method, the code assist feature replaces more than necessary. The code is changed to: baz(x.foo().foo()). It should instead replace only until the cursor location, resulting in: baz(x.foo()x.foo()).", "EB": "The code assist feature should replace the code only until the cursor location, not until the end of the current identifier. In the given example, when calling the method `baz` in the `bar` method, it should replace only until the cursor location, resulting in: baz(x.foo()x.foo()).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open the enclosed class.\n2. Go to the `bar` method.\n3. Call the `baz` method by typing `baz(` and use the code assist feature.\n4. Observe that the code assist replaces more code than expected, replacing until the end of the current identifier instead of the cursor location."}
