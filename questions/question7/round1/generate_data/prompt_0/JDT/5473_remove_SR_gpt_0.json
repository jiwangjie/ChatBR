Instead of the second line being shifted left and the first line being shifted left, at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab), the text does not shift as expected. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but it is confusing if there is a stray space, as the user is unsure why the text won't shift.", "EB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing the ShiftLeft operation should result in the second line being shifted left and the first line being shifted left, at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Regardless of the specific specification, this behavior should not be confusing to the user, and they should understand why the text is not shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n3. Observe that the text does not shift as expected."}
