When executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). It is also important to handle scenarios with stray spaces to prevent confusion.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   - A space\n   - A tab\n   - Some text\n   - A tab\n   - Some text\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n5. Observe that nothing moves."}
