Note that searching via context menu in the packages view does work.", "EB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, the search should first try to get the Java element. If that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  1. Open the Package view selection and dialog. 2. Enter a search query for declarations. 3. Confirm that the search does not return any results. 4. Note that searching via context menu in the packages view does work."}
