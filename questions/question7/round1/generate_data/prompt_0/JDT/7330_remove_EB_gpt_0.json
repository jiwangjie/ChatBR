I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. Not all actions need to be in the context menu, but all must be reachable from the editor. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu or some other global menu, without requiring users to switch views.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select some text and try to find the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the context menu (or some other global menu)."}
