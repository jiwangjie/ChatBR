{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "There is a bug in the software where the classpath and output location settings are not being set together as one operation. Additionally, the error message displayed is incorrect.", "OB": "Currently, the classpath and output location settings are being set separately, leading to inconsistency in the software behavior. Additionally, the error message displayed when attempting to set the classpath and output location is strange.", "EB": "The software should provide the option to set the classpath and output location as one operation, similar to the validation process. The error message should accurately inform the user that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Go to the project properties.\n3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
