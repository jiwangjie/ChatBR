{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details 20020212a. Mnemonicsb. No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the superclass), so could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g.", "OB": "When going to the next page, the title says 'Type not found'. The browse button is too small. Types from the source folders of the own project and not just any types should be shown in the dialog. The destination type can be the source type. Refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "The browse button should be of standard size. The label should say 'Select destination type:'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type should not cause any warnings or pseudo changes in referencing classes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. At the dialog, select a destination type that is also a source type.\n3. Proceed to the next page.\n4. Observe the incorrect 'Type not found' title and the incorrect warnings and pseudo changes in the referencing classes.\n\nTo verify the solution:\n1. Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Verify that the browse button is of standard size.\n3. Observe that the label says 'Select destination type:'.\n4. Verify that only types from the source folders of the own project are shown in the dialog.\n5. Verify that selecting a source type as the destination type does not cause any warnings or pseudo changes in referencing classes."}
