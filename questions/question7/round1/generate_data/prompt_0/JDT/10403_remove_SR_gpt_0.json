{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the 'bin' directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory ('bin') can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a 'bin' directory which contains more than just .class files. This 'bin' directory may also contain other files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder to a 'bin' directory, the system should verify that the 'bin' directory can be completely deleted and then rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. In the project settings, set the output folder to a 'bin' directory. \n3. Attempt to delete the 'bin' directory. \n4. Verify that the system confirms the deletion and proceeds to rebuild the 'bin' directory."}
