{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the software does not confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. As a result, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The software should confirm during project creation that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This confirmation is necessary to avoid issues where the output directory points to a bin directory that has additional files besides .class files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Set the output folder to point at a bin directory. \n3. Confirm that the software does not provide any warning or confirmation message about deleting and rebuilding the output directory. Ensure that the bin directory contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files."}
