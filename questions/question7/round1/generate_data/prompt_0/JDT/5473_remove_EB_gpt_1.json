However, it is unclear how this behavior is specified. In the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., removing the tab). Regardless, the presence of a stray space is confusing, and it's unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that executing ShiftLeft after replacing the tab character with spaces should align both lines consistently. The second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, eliminating any tab-related discrepancies.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue in a default text editor, follow these steps:\n1. Type in the following:\n   <space<tab>some text<tab>some text\n   Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces to ensure visual alignment.\n2. Highlight the two lines above.\n3. Execute ShiftLeft.\n   Notice that nothing moves as expected."}
