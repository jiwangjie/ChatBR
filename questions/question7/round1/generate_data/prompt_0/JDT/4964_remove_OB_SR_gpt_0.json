Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, the system suggests incorrect code options based on user input.", "EB": "The automatic code assist feature should be smarter and prioritize more relevant code suggestions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Type a '('.\n2. Observe the code assist suggestions.\n3. Notice that the system incorrectly suggests the option 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'.\n4. Delete the incorrect suggestion and start typing again."}
