I don't understand it.", "OB": "When I hit F4 on a binary project selection (e.g. org.apache.ant), I get the error message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1.
