Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. The label could say 'Select destination type:'g. ", "OB": "When going to the next page, the title of the dialog says 'Type not found'. The browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes). Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type can be the source type, but refactoring warns that this will result in errors and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": ""}
