{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, there is no confirmation or validation process to ensure that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This can pose a problem because some users have been pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The software should provide a confirmation or validation step during project creation to ensure that the selected output directory (bin directory) can be deleted and rebuilt successfully.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software and navigate to the project creation wizard.\n2. Choose to create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n3. Specify a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Proceed with the project creation.\n5. Note that there is no confirmation or validation step to ensure that the selected bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
