{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. It should be available in the Edit (or some other global) menu. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference, which is not clear to users. Some actions are in the context menu while others are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views just to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the action to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is present in the context menu. If not, switch to the Outline view and check again."}
