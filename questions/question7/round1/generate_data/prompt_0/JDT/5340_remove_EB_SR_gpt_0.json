{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to add an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Despite the cancellation request, the exception list appears and ignores the cancelation request.", "EB": "The software should either honor the cancellation request and prevent the exception list from appearing, or disable the cancel button during the process of adding an exception breakpoint. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to false.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software \n2. Navigate to the breakpoint settings \n3. Select 'Add exception breakpoint' \n4. Observe that the progress dialog closes immediately and the exception list appears, ignoring the cancellation request."}
