{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When attempting to cancel adding an exception breakpoint in the breakpoints pane of the debug perspective, the progress dialog closes immediately and the exception list still comes up, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The cancelling of adding an exception breakpoint should have an effect. Either it should honour the cancellation request and prevent the exception list from coming up, or it should disable the cancel button when calling `ProgressMonitorDialog.run` by passing `false` for the `cancellable` parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. \n2) Click the J! button to add an exception. \n3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
