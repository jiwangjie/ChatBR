The first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, or the tab characters should be replaced with spaces before the shift operation.", "SR": "1. Open the text editor with a file containing two lines, where the first line contains a mixture of tabs and spaces, and the second line contains only spaces.\n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n4. Observe the behavior and verify that the text is shifted according to the expected indentation."}
