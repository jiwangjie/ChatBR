I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. It seems that the actions are currently distributed based on personal taste, but I believe this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor without forcing users to switch views.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the current view.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available directly in the Edit menu or some other global menu.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the editor. \n2. Select a block of text. \n3. Check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available in the current view. \n4. Switch to the Outline view and check if the action is now available."}
