{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the software consumes too much code. This issue occurs when trying to add a parameter to the 'baz' function call in the 'bar' function.", "OB": "The code is currently changed to 'baz(x.foo().foo())', but it should be changed to 'baz(x.x.foo())'.", "EB": "The code assist should only replace the necessary portion of the code, in this case, 'x.foo()', and not consume additional code.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Change the 'baz' call to 'baz(x.x.foo())'. 2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'. 3. Use the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+Space' to trigger code assist. 4. Type 'f' to filter the options. 5. Select 'foo()'. 6. Observe the code assist replacing more code than expected."}
