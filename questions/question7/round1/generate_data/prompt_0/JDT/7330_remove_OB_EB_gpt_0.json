I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not (not all need to be in the context menu, but all must be reachable from the editor. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.)", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the Edit menu. It can only be found after switching to the Outline view.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be accessible from the Edit menu without the need to switch to the Outline view. All actions should follow a consistent distribution and be reachable from the editor.", "SR": "1. Open the software.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Go to the Edit menu and check for the presence of the 'Add Javadoc Comment' option."}
