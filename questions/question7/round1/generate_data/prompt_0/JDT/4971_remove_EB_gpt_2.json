{"id": "4971", "title": "Bug 4971 - Strange 'copy package'", "description": "When performing the 'copy package' operation in the jdt.ui3 plugin of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui, a package named 'ui' is unexpectedly included in the resulting destination folder. This behavior is not in line with our expectations.", "OB": "After executing the 'copy package' operation, the destination folder (xx) contains an additional package named 'ui' that was not intended to be copied.", "EB": "The 'copy package' operation should only copy the selected package and its contents, without including any additional packages that are not directly related to the selected package. Therefore, the resulting destination folder should not contain the 'ui' package.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Create a new project (xxx)  \n2. Open the Package viewer in the project  \n3. Select a package in the project (e.g., package A)  \n4. From the context menu, choose the 'copy' option"}
