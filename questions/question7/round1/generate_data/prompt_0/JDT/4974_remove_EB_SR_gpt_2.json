{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the user presses 'Ok' after attempting to set the output location, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src.' The issue arises from the fact that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. Setting the output location first leads to an illegal state.", "EB": "Expect that setting the classpath and output location should be treated as a single, atomic operation. The system should allow users to configure both the classpath and output location without encountering conflicts or creating an illegal state.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application and navigate to the configuration settings for classpath and output location.\n2. Attempt to set the output location without configuring the classpath.\n3. Press 'Ok' to confirm the changes and observe the error message."}
