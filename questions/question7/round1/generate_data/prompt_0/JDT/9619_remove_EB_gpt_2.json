{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details 20020212a. Mnemonicsb. No validation on the type field. Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for a superclass), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. the label could say 'Select destination type:'g. Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes)c. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.e. The destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "The browse button is too small. The title is used for long text and when going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. The dialog shows types from a CU in a different project as an option for selection. Moving the static member to the destination type incorrectly warns that it will result in errors and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "EB": "The browse button should have a standard size. The title should not be used for long text and should not display 'Type not found' when going to the next page. Only types from the source folders of the current project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type should be allowed to be the same as the source type without warning about errors or making pseudo changes in referencing classes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps: 1. Open the dialog for moving a static member. 2. Observe that the browse button is too small. 3. Observe that the title is used for long text and displays 'Type not found' when switching to the next page. 4. Browse for a type and observe that a type from a CU in a different project is shown as an option. 5. Try moving the static member to the same type it is currently in and observe the incorrect warning about errors and pseudo changes in referencing classes."}
