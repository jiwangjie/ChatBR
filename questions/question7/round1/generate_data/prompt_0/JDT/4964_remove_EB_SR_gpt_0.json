{"id": "4964", "title": "Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose' and then '(' character, the automatic code assist inserts the wrong item 'DISPOSED' instead of the expected 'dispose()' method.", "EB": "Code assist should be smarter and suggest the 'dispose()' method when it detects that I have typed a '(' after 'button.dispose'. Alternatively, it should be case sensitive and not insert items that don't match the typed text.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor and start typing SWT code.\n2. Type 'button.dispose'.\n3. Type a '(' character immediately after 'button.dispose'.\n4. Observe the code assist list and see if the wrong item 'DISPOSED' is inserted instead of 'dispose()'.\n5. Repeat the same steps while ensuring that the automatic code assist is enabled."}
