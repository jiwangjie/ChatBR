That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, the software works as expected and shuts down successfully. However, it prints an error message during the shutdown process.", "EB": "During the shutdown process, the software should not print any error messages when using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml file.\n2. Start the Tomcat server as a Windows service.\n3. Shutdown the Windows service and observe the error message that is printed during the process."}
