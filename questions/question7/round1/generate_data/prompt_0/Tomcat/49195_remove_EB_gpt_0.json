However, Tomcat stops regardless of this error message.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file:\n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nAlthough this error message is displayed, Tomcat actually stops after the message is printed. In the code, after printing the message, the Catalina.stopServer method performs System.exit(1) to shutdown Tomcat. It is important to note that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server instance is not null.", "EB": "When using port 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, the error message should not be printed in the catalina.log file. Tomcat should stop without any error messages being displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on a Windows machine.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling the Catalina.stop() method."}
