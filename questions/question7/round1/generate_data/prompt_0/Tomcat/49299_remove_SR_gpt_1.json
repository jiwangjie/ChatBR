{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 discrepancy with custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299: In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL, provided URL rewriting has been enabled. However, the actual behavior does not match the expected behavior.", "OB": "The page sends a session tracking cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name.", "EB": "The expected result is that the 'Reload' link should use the custom cookie name in the URL instead of 'jsessionid'. For example, the 'Reload' link should be: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Configure a web application with a custom name for its session tracking cookie. \n2. Enable URL rewriting. \n3. Load a page from the web application. \n4. Observe that the session tracking cookie is sent with the custom name. \n5. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page. \n6. Observe that the 'jsessionid' parameter is used instead of the custom cookie name in the URL."}
