{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name and URL rewriting in Servlet 3.0", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the observed behavior is different. The URL generated by the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name.", "OB": "The page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the URL generated for the Reload link uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name. For example, the URL is 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4'.", "EB": "The custom name configured for the session tracking cookie should also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL with URL rewriting enabled. The URL should be in the format 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4' where 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' is the custom cookie name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Configure a web application with a custom name for its session tracking cookie.\n2. Enable URL rewriting.\n3. Load the page and observe the generated cookie name and URL for the Reload link."}
