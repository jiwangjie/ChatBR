{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). It has been tested with trunk at revision 957942 and is expected to affect version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6 (TC6), there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, allowing Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This functionality is implemented through separate methods Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start(). This behavior breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first Tomcat instance successfully.", "OB": "There is no observed behavior provided in the bug report.", "EB": "Expected behavior: In the StandardService.initInternal() method, the connector.init() call should fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there, and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. This rethrown exception should then be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which will abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
