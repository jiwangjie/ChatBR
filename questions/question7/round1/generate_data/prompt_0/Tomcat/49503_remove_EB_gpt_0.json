Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.\n\n[1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html\nDowngrading user: When running with jsvc, it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80).\nI do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.\n\n3. Actual behavior: The exception does not happen because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().\n", "OB": "The connector does not try to bind to the port when the first instance starts.
