However, the observed behavior is that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses the default 'jsessionid' instead.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL, provided that URL rewriting has been enabled.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file.2. Access 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'.3. Verify that the cookie sent has the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name."}
