{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "The bug report describes an issue related to using 1 as the shutdown port in the server.xml file for Tomcat. When using this configuration with a Windows service, an error message is printed even though Tomcat stops successfully. The bug report suggests that there could be improvements in how Tomcat is stopped, and mentions that the issue may also occur with jsvc, although it has not been tested.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message is: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat successfully stops. After printing the error message, the Catalina stopServer() function calls System.exit(1) to shut down Tomcat. It is noted that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server object is not null.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, no error message should be printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. Tomcat should still stop successfully without any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Modify the server.xml file to set the shutdown port to 1. 2. Start Tomcat as a Windows service. 3. Monitor the catalina.20100427.log file for any error messages related to the shutdown process. Note that Tomcat should still stop successfully despite the error message."}
