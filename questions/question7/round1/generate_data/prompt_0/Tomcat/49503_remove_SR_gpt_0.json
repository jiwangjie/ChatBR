{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started.IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully. ", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (80). The issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 applied in r957960. The second instance fails, but not in the expected way. The exception from connector.init() does not happen because the connector does not try to bind to the port. Instead, it binds when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "In StandardService.initInternal(), I would expect the connector.init() call to fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() is caught there, and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Start Tomcat with jsvc. 2.
