{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When a Tomcat service is installed on Windows and the service is stopped, an error message is printed despite the shutdown port being set to 1 in the server.xml file.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in the StandardServer.await() method, so that it can be woken up by a notifyAll() call or by using the interrupt() call on the relevant thread.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling Catalina.stop()."}
