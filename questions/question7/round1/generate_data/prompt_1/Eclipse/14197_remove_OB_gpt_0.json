{"id": "14197", "title": "Removing a working set immediately makes changes", "description": "When removing a working set, the package view in the background immediately refilters. This behavior is not expected.", "OB": "When I delete a working set, the package view is refiltered immediately.", "EB": "The package view should only be refiltered when closing the working set selection dialog, not while manipulating. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to the working sets, including canceling the remove operation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a working set with one project and select it. The package view should be filtered. 2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set. Then, delete the first working set."}
