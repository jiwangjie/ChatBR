Go to the Java Perspective. Open a java file by simply double clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench. Right click on the Java file. Select 'Open With' and then 'System Editor'. Nothing happens. The workbench should display a warning message indicating that attempting to open the file in another editor may overwrite changes and asking if the user wants to continue, or an error message stating that all files need to be closed first. We believe this is a safety feature that prevents external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "When selecting 'Open With' and then 'System Editor' on a file that is already opened in the workbench, a warning message should be displayed, informing the user about the potential of overwriting changes and asking for confirmation to proceed, or an error message should be displayed, indicating that all files need to be closed before opening in another editor.", "SR": "1.
