", "OB": "When a new file is created on Windows using Eclipse, the line delimiters are automatically set to the Windows format (CR-LF).", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters (LF) since the end product is a Unix product.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Launch Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiters used in the new file.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The new file should have Unix line delimiters (LF) by default.\n\nNotes:\n- There should be a UI (Preference) available in the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files.\n- Possible values for line delimiters should include: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter.\n- The UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure all plugins use the same line delimiter for new files."}
