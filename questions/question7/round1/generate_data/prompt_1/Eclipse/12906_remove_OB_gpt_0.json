Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the Java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Now, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nCurrently, nothing happens when performing this step. However, the workbench should display a warning message saying that you may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue, or an error message stating that you should close all files first.\n\nWe believe this is a safety feature where the WSAD (Workspace App Development) doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."}
