{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... The PropertySheetViewer lets me edit objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include ComboBoxCellEditor constructor, which can accept strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column. A problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It seems that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The problem is that the drop-down button may now be too far right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, so it is clipped. From a user experience perspective, they can no longer see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. When one of the strings entered in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the resulting combo box grows to contain the widest item. As a consequence, the drop-down button on the right side of the combo box may be positioned outside of the visible area of the property sheet, leading to it being clipped from view.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should dynamically adjust its size in the property sheet to accommodate strings of varying widths. Specifically, when a string in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, both the combo box and the drop-down button should remain fully visible within the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the property sheet containing a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n2. Input a string that is wider than the width of the property sheet column into the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe how the combo box expands to contain the widest item and how the drop-down button may be positioned outside of the visible area of the property sheet, leading to it being clipped."}
