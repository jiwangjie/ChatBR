{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer, the ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. However, the drop-down button may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped. As a result, the user can no longer see the combo drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet should size correctly, ensuring that the drop-down button is always visible within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Create a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet with strings that are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n3. Observe that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item.\n4. Verify that the drop-down button is too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, causing it to be clipped.\n5. Ensure that the button becomes visible by making the property sheet view wider."}
