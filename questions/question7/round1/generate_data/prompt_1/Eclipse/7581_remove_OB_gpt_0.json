{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "When using ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet, if any of the strings in the combo box are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box expands to fit the widest item. However, the drop down button may be positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet, making it impossible for the user to see or click the button.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always be the same width as the property sheet column. This way, the drop down button would always be visible and accessible to the user. The behavior should be consistent with the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object with row pairs in two columns.\n3. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create a ComboBoxCellEditor for column two, providing a set of strings.\n4. Ensure that at least one string is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Observe that the combo box expands to fit the widest item, but the drop down button may be clipped and positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet.\nNote: It needs to be investigated whether this is a problem with our code or with the SWT library."}
