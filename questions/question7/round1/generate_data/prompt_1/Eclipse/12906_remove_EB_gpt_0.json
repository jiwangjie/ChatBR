However, nothing happens and there is no warning or error message displayed in the workbench.", "EB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, if the user tries to open the same file in another editor by right clicking on the file and selecting 'Open With' followed by 'System Editor', a warning message should be displayed in the workbench. The warning message should inform the user that they may overwrite changes and ask if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, stating that all files need to be closed first before opening the file in another editor. This is a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workspace.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
