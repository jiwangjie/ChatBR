{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) move below the label. This behavior is observed on linux, running build 20011127. However, it does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000. If the close button and other icons start moving around when the view is resized, it may confuse users.", "EB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the close button remains in its original position and does not move down below the label. The pulldown menu icon (triangle) should also stay in the same position relative to the label. This behavior is expected on all platforms and builds.", "SR": "1. Open the Navigator view.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Observe the position of the close button and other icons relative to the label.\n4. Repeat the above steps on different platforms and builds to verify the consistency of the issue."}
