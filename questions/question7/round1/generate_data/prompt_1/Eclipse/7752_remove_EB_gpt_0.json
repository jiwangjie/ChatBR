{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752: Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., \"foo.txt\").\n3. From the main menu, select File -> Export and select Zip File to export.\n4. In the Export dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (e.g., test.zip), and begin the export to zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up, indicating that problems were encountered during the export. The error message specifically mentions the file of the same name in project2 as the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe export process should complete successfully without any error messages. The zip file should contain all the selected files from both projects, including the files with the same name under different directories.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., \"foo.txt\").\n3. From the main menu, select File -> Export and select Zip File to export.\n4.
