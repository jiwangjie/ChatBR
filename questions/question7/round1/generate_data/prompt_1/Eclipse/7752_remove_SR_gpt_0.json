{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752 - Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Launch the application. \n2. Create two projects. \n3. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects. \n4. Provide a name for the zip file (e.g., 'test.zip') and start the export process. \n\nObserved Behavior: \nUpon exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, an error message box appears. The error message indicates that problems were encountered during the export process. The detail section of the error message specifically mentions the file with the same name in project 2 as the problem (e.g., 'foo.txt' in project 2). \n\nExpected Behavior: \nThe zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories without any issues. \n\nSteps to Reproduce: \n1. Launch the application. \n2. Create two projects. \n3. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects. \n4. Provide a name for the zip file (e.g., 'test.zip') and start the export process. \n5. Verify that the export completes successfully without any error message appearing. \n6. Inspect the contents of the generated zip file to ensure that it contains all the files from both projects, including the ones with the same name under different directories."}
