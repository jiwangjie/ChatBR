{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes.", "OB": "When creating a new file, we currently use the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"), but this might not always be desired by the user.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI in the Preferences section to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include DOS/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench, ensuring that all plugins use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse.\n2. Go to the Preferences section.\n3. Look for the option to define the default line delimiter for new files.\n4. Choose the desired line delimiter from the available options.\n5. Create a new file and verify that the chosen line delimiter is used."}
