{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On the Linux platform, when running build 20011127 (this issue does not occur on build 20011116 on Nt2000), if a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), move below the label. This behavior may confuse users.", "EB": "In previous versions, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) always stayed on the same line as the label, regardless of how small the view was. This behavior should be maintained to ensure usability. Users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located at the far-right corner.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  1. Open the application on Linux platform.  2. Go to the Navigator view.  3. Resize the view to make it smaller. Observe the position of the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) relative to the label."}
