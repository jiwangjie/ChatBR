", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet.", "EB": "I expected the behavior to be that the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as DialogCellEditor where the Button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this is our issue or an issue with SWT.", "SR": "- Open the property sheet.\n- Add a property with a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n- Observe the size of the ComboBoxCellEditor and compare it to the width of the property sheet column."}
