There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for line delimiters should include: DOS/Windows, Mac, Unix, and Default platform line delimiter. The UI should be consistent across all plugins for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Use both Unix and Windows workstations to develop a Unix product/program. 2. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation. 3. Create a new file. 4. Check the line delimiter used in the new file."}
