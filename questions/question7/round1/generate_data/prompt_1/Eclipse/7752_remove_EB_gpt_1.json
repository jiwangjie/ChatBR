{"id": "7752", "title": "Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as 'foo.txt').\n3. From the main menu, select File > Export and select 'Zip File' to export.\n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (such as 'test.zip'), and begin the export to zip file.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message pops up stating that problems were encountered during export, and the detail lists the file with the same name in project 2 as the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe export process should successfully complete without encountering any problems, and all files with the same name under different directories should be included in the zip file.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nPlease follow the steps mentioned in the 'Steps to reproduce' section above to recreate the issue."}
