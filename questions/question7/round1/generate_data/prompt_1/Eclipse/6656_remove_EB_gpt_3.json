{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "The close button moves down when the view is resized smaller on Linux, running build 20011127. This issue does not occur on build 20011116 on Nt2000. When the view, such as the Navigator, is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, both the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. This behavior may confuse users.", "OB": "On Linux, running build 20011127, when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, both the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down.", "EB": "When a view, such as the Navigator, is resized smaller, the close button should remain in its original position and not move down with the tool items.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch the application on Linux, running build 20011127. 2. Open a view, such as the Navigator. 3. Resize the view to be smaller. 4.
