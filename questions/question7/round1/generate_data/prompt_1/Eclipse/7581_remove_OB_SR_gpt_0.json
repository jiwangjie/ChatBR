The width of the combo box is not matching the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the combo box should always be the same width as the property sheet column. It should work the same way as the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Edit a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Notice that the combo box does not properly fit the column width."}
