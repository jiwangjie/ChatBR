{"id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752: Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and select 'Zip File' to export\n\nObserved behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. In the 'Export' dialog window, when selecting both projects created earlier, giving the zip file a name (e.g., 'test.zip'), and beginning the export to the zip file, an error message pops up with the following details: 'Problems were encountered during export', and the detail section lists the file with the same name in 'project2' as the problem.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe export process should complete successfully without encountering any errors, allowing multiple files with the same name under different directories to be included in the zip file.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt')\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and select 'Zip File' to export"}
