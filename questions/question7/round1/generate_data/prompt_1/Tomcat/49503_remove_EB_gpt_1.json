{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load() but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstart.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully. When running with jsvc, it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. 3. Actual behavior: The exception does not happen because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "When starting two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time, the first instance starts successfully while the second instance fails.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that both instances should start successfully without any issues.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
