{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.  DowngradinguserWhen running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. 3. Actual behaviour: The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "The second instance fails, but not in the expected way. The exception does not happen because the connector does not try to bind to the port until start() is called.", "EB": "In StandardServiceinitInternal(), I expect the connector.init() call to fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in Catalinaload() and then rethrown as an Error, ultimately aborting Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Start the first instance successfully. 2. Try starting a second instance. The second instance should fail in an unexpected way."}
