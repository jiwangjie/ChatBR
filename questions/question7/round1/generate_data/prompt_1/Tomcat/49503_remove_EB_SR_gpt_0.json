{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503 - Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80). This issue was observed while testing the fix for bug 49030 and bug 48625 in revision 957960. The first instance starts successfully, but the second instance fails in an unexpected way. The connector does not try to bind to the port during the startup, but only binds when the start() method is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await() method.", "OB": "During startup, the connector does not attempt to bind to the port.", "EB": "During startup, the connector should attempt to bind to the port.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Run Tomcat using jsvc.\n2. Start two instances of Tomcat.\n3. Observe that the second instance fails to bind to the port during the startup process."}
