{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods. However, in trunk revision 957942 and possibly in version 7.0.0 as well, Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load() but only later in start(). This seems to break the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully.\n\nOB:\n\nEB:\n\nSR:"}
