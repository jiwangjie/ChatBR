{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When starting Tomcat, the connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method. Instead, they bind to their ports later in the start() method.", "EB": "I would expect that in the StandardServiceinitInternal() method, the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. This exception from connector.init() should be caught there and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then it should be caught in Catalinaload() and rethrown as an Error, which would abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first instance of Tomcat and observe that it starts successfully."}
