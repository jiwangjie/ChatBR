However, the actual behavior observed is that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' and the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that if a custom name is configured for session tracking cookies, the Reload link should include the custom cookie name in the URL as follows: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Enable URL rewriting in the web application.\n2. Configure a custom name for the session tracking cookies.\n3. Access the web application and observe the cookies being set.\n4. Click on the Reload link on the page and observe the URL generated."}
