For example, if the custom cookie name is 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', the expected URL for the Reload link would be 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Go to the servlet specified in the bug report (ch.7.1.1).\n2. Set a custom cookie name.\n3. Reload the page.\n4. Observe that the URL for the Reload link does not include the custom cookie name in the URL rewriting."}
