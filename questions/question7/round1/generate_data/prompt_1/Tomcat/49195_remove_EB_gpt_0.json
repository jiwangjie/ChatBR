That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried..", "OB": "When the Tomcat Windows service is stopped with the shutdown port configured as '1', the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat stops regardless of the error message. After printing the message, Catalina.stopServer() calls System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown.

Server not shut down.' should not be printed when the Tomcat Windows service is stopped with the shutdown port configured as '1'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal by calling Catalina.stop()."}
