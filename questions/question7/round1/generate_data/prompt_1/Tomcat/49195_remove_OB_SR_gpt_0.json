{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using shutdown port 1 with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, the Windows service works, but it prints an error message. This behavior could be improved by finding a better way to stop Tomcat. Currently, System.exit(0) is used, but it may not work in all cases. It would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(). This would allow the server to be woken up by a notifyAll() call or an interrupt() call.", "OB": "When using port 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, an error message is printed.", "EB": "When using port 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, no error message should be printed.", "SR": "1. Modify the server.xml to include <Server port=\"1\".\n2. Start the Windows service.\n3. Check if an error message is printed when stopping the Windows service using the shutdown port 1."}
