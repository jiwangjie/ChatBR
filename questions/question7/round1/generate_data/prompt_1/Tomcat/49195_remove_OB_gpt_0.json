{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using shutdown port 1 with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, I noticed that while the Tomcat server stops correctly when using it as a Windows service, it also prints an error message. There could be improvements in how Tomcat is stopped, as currently, System.exit(0) is used regardless of the shutdown port configuration. It's possible that jsvc shows the same behavior, but I have not tested it.", "OB": "When starting the Tomcat service and stopping it, an error message is printed.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when the Tomcat service is stopped.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling Catalina.stop()."}
