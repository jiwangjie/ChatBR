{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port = \"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat stops but prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log:\n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nIt is just a message and does not impact the shutdown process. After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It should be noted that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server should not be null.", "EB": "Instead of using sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), it would be better to use wait(10000) so that it could be woken up by a notifyAll() call, or use an interrupt() call if the thread is known.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Configure the Tomcat server.xml to specify <Server port=\"1\".\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service.\n3. Check the catalina log file for the error message mentioned above."}
