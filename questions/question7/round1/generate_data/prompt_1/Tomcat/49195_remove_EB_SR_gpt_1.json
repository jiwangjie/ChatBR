{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Despite this error message, Tomcat actually stops functioning properly. This issue may also occur with jsvc, although it has not been tested. It appears that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, the catalina.20100427.log prints the following error message: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat is still shut down successfully.", "EB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, the catalina.20100427.log should not print the error message 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'. Instead, the log should indicate that the server has been shut down properly.", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, perform the following steps:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service\n3. Check the catalina.20100427.log for the error message 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'\n4. Observe that despite this error message, Tomcat is properly shut down."}
