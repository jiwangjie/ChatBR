Build Tomcat 7.0.0 from svn r939221.\n2. Use the following code:\n\n@MySomeAnn\npublic class MySomeClass {...}\n\n@HandlesTypes(MySomeAnn.class)\npublic class ModuleInitializer implements ServletContainerInitializer {\n    @Override\n    public void onStartup(Set<Class<?>> classSet, ServletContext ctx) throws ServletException {\n        for (Class<?> targetClass : classSet) {\n            System.out.println(targetClass.getName());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n3. Run the project.\n4. Observe that the output is always 'MySomeClass' instead of 'MySomeAnn'."}
