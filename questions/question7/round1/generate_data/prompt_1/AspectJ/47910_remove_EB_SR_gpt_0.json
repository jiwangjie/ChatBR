{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc, the outjar command to create a jar file does not include the MANIFEST.MF file. Currently, when executing the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar', an output file with a .jar extension is created. However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not have a MANIFEST.MF file. It seems that the outjar command is intended to create a zip file, but it is not clear why it is called 'outjar' instead of 'outzip'.", "OB": "When executing the 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar' command, an output file with a .jar extension is created, but it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "When executing the 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar' command, a valid jar file should be created with a MANIFEST.MF file included.", "SR": "1. Verify that the 'ajc' command is installed and accessible.\n2. Create a directory 'mydir' with some source files.\n3. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar'.\n4. Check the contents of the generated my.jar file to verify that it includes a MANIFEST.MF."}
