{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using the ajc command with the outjar option, the resulting file should be a valid jar file. However, currently when the outjar option is used, the resulting file does not contain a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I call ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar and an output file is created with a .jar extension, the resulting file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "When I call ajc with the sourceroots parameter and use the outjar parameter to specify an output file, the resulting file should be a valid jar file. This means that it should contain a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run ajc with the sourceroots parameter set to <mydir and the outjar parameter set to <my.jar. \n2. Verify that an output file is created with a .jar extension. \n3. Check the contents of the resulting jar file and confirm that it does not contain a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file."}
