{"id": "47910", "title": "ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The bug report states that when using the 'ajc' command with the 'outjar' option and providing a source directory, it creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, the output file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The reported behavior seems to contradict the documentation, which suggests that the 'outjar' parameter should create a zip file. It is mentioned that there is a file called METAINF/MANIFEST.MF in the target directory.", "OB": "When I execute the 'ajc' command with the following parameters: sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, an output file with a .jar extension is created. However, the output file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. ", "EB": "After executing the 'ajc' command with the mentioned parameters, I expect the output file <my.jar to be a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file present. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Execute the 'ajc' command with the following parameters: sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar\n2. Check the output file <my.jar and verify that it lacks a MANIFEST.MF file. "}
