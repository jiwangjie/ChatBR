{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path is incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When declaring warning messages on binary files, the source path is displayed incorrectly as \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\". In some cases, the filenames may not appear at all. I observed this issue in AJDT. To reproduce the problem, please run the provided code in the \"tests/new/binaryWarnings/\" directory. It's worth noting that these tests may generate false positives as filename checking is not enabled during message verification in the harness. AJDT may simply omit the filename if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" rather than \"app/Main\". In some cases, the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the source path to be displayed correctly as \"app/Main\" in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars. Additionally, the filenames should always appear consistently.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Run the code provided in the \"tests/new/binaryWarnings/\" directory. 2. Observe the declare warning messages displayed, which should show the source path incorrectly as \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\"."}
