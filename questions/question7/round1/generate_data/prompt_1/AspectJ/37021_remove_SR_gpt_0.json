The problem can be reproduced by running the code in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory. However, please note that these tests may give false positives when detecting this error due to the lack of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, filenames that don't make sense to AJDT are simply omitted.)", "OB": "In declare warning messages that target .class files from injars, the sourcepath is displayed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these specific tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages that target .class files from injars, the sourcepath should be displayed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Navigate to the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory. 2. Follow the instructions in the code to run it. 3. Observe the declare warning messages and verify that the sourcepath is displayed incorrectly in the form 'app.Main.class'."}
