{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs the -d option to correctly compile classes from a subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and differs from javac. I suspect it may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in the 'subpackage' subpackage:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println('Hello');\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter compiling, a directory named 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe 'subpackage' directory should not be created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nThe same behavior as javac is desired.", "OB": "After compiling, a directory named 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "EB": "The 'subpackage' directory should not be created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1.
