To reproduce the issue, please refer to the code in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'. Please note that these tests may give false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It seems that AJDT omits filenames that make no sense to it.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes, the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "The sourcepath in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed in the form 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'. The filenames should consistently appear in the messages.", "SR": "- Go to the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory.\n- Run the code in that directory.\n- Observe the declare warning messages and check if the sourcepath is in the correct format ('app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class').\n- Verify that the filenames consistently appear in the messages."}
