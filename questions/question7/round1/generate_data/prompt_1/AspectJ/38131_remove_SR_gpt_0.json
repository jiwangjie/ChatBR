{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "Bug 38131ajc needs -d option. I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile the class using the following command:\n   ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- The test.class is then put in a subpackage\\subpackage directory.\n- Running the java command results in the following error: Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- The behavior should be the same as javac.\n\nSuggested Resolution:\n- Add the -d . option to the ajc command."}
