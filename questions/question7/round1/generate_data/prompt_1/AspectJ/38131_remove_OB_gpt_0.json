This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d subpackage subpackage\\Test.java\n\nCurrently, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory when using ajc command. However, with javac command, this behavior does not occur.\n\nExpected behavior:\nWhen compiling with ajc command, the same behavior as javac command should be observed. No additional \"subpackage\" directory should be created.", "OB": "When compiling with ajc command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "When compiling with ajc command, no additional \"subpackage\" directory should be created.", "SR": "1.
