This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\nCreate a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command:\n\najc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nThe directory \"subpackage\" should be created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory when compiling with ajc, just like it does when compiling with javac.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Create a class in a subpackage as mentioned above.\n2. Compile the class using the command \"ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\".\n3. Verify that the directory \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n", "OB": "NA", "EB": "But it will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "SR": ""}
