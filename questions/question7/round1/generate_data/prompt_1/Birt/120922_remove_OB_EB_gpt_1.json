(including the quotes). The user is then required to determine how to either save or discard their changes. The dialog box offers the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' with the following behavior: selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, selecting 'No' would discard the changes, and selecting 'Cancel' would do nothing and keep the user on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog box is incorrectly titled as 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "When attempting to switch from the 'source' view to the Layout view in the XML Report Designer editor without saving the changes, an error message is displayed with the text 'Dirty Page' (including the quotes) and the message 'Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved.'
