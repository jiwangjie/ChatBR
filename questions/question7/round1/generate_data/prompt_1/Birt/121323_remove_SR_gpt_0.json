{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The filter information should be persisted along with the RelationInformation in .rptdesign, so that the filter conditions are not lost when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part. 3. Verify that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. 4. Close the dialog and reopen it. 5. Verify that the filterInfo HashMap still contains the previously entered filter information."}
