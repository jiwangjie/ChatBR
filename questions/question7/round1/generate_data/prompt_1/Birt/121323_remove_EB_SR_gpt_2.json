{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation object gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior leads to trouble as XPath expressions are not treated correctly.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'. \n3. Check that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. \n4. Close the dialog. \n5. Open the .rptdesign file and check that the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
