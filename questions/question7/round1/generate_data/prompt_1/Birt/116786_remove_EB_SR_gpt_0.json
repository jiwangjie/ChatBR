It should be saved as a relative path.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design.\n2. Locate the 'fileName' property.\n3. Verify that it is storing an absolute path instead of a relative path.\n4. Update the property to save the file path as a relative path.\n5. Save the report design and reopen it to confirm that the 'fileName' property now stores a relative path."}
