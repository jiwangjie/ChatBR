", "EB": "When sorting on disk, if sorting on 40000 rows of data and setting the program to process less than 40000 rows, the expected behavior is: 1. The program should save the file as a temporary file. 2. The program should load the file into memory. 3. The program should perform the sorting operation on the data. 4. The program should save the sorted data back to the temporary file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Set up a scenario where there are 40000 rows of data to be sorted on disk. 2. Configure the program to process less than 40000 rows. 3. Perform the sorting operation on the data. 4. Observe if the program saves the file as a temporary file, loads it into memory, performs the sorting, and saves the sorted data back to the temporary file."}
