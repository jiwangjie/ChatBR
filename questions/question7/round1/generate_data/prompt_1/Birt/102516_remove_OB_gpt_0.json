{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a while to load. Eventually, a message is displayed saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will prevent the delay in loading the entire schema and the limitation of viewing only 500 items in the available list.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the delay in querying the entire schema and the limit of 500 items in the available list. Reference Bug 101372 for the request to filter based on schema."}
