{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path. We need to save the relative path. The property `<property name=\"fileName\"/>E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>` is storing the absolute path.", "EB": "The report design should store the relative path instead of the absolute path. The property should be `<property name=\"fileName\">../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>`.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design.\n2. View the property `<property name=\"fileName\"/>`.\n3. Observe that the absolute path is being stored.\n4. Modify the property to store the relative path `<property name=\"fileName\">../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>`.\n5. Save the report design and verify that the relative path is now stored."}
