{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. With the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the schema filter is present, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system.

This will greatly improve performance and prevent the warning message.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Ensure the iSeries platform is being used with the JTOpen JDBC drivers.\n3. Verify that the tree control displays all schemas (catalogs) on the system.\n4. Check if there is a warning message on load indicating the tree is being populated.\n5. Verify that the schema filter is present.\n6. Test if the table and column information is loaded on demand rather than on load."}
