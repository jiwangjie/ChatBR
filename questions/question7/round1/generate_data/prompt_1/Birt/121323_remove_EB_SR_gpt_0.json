{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior of treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to a lot of trouble.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'].\n3. Add some filter information using the filterInfo HashMap in the RelationInformation class.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Re-open the XML Edit Data Set dialog and check if the filter information is still present."}
