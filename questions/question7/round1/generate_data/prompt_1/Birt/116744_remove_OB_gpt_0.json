Create a database field with three types of content:\n   a) HTML text within <html>...</html> tag.\n   b) HTML fragments not within <html> tag.\n   c) Text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element in the report to display the contents of this field.\n3. Set the Content Type property of the dynamic text element to Auto, Plain, or HTML.\n4. Generate and view the report.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n- The report always displays the same results, regardless of the Content Type property set for the dynamic text element.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- When the Content Type is set to Plain, the literal content should be displayed.\n- When the Content Type is set to Auto, content 1, 2, and 3 should appear properly without any HTML or RTF tags.\n- When the Content Type is set to HTML, content 1 and 2 should appear properly without any HTML tags, and content 3 should appear literally with RTF tags.\n\nPlease refer to the attached report for more details."}
