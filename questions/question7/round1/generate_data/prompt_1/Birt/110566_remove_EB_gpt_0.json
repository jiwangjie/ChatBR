The expected behavior is that row[0] cannot be used as a filter expression since it can only be generated after all data has been fetched.", "OB": "When setting a filter in the data set with the expression \"row[0] equals to\", the first result record is returned when previewed.", "EB": "No specific expected behavior was mentioned in the bug report, but based on the context, the expected behavior is that the filter should not be applied and no records should be returned.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Set a filter in the data set with the expression \"row[0] equals to\"\n2. Click on the Preview tab"}
