The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, the tree is loaded automatically when the page is opened. However, this can cause performance issues when the data source contains a large number of tables and columns. The user suggests that the loading of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "Currently, the JDBC Data Set Editor page loads all the tables and columns in the data source when the page is opened, regardless of whether the user needs all the information at that time.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page should only load the tables and columns when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve the performance of the page when working with data sources that have a large number of tables and columns.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL query.\n2. Observe that all the tables and columns from the data source are loaded automatically.\n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter.\n4. Verify that only the relevant tables and columns are loaded at this point, improving the performance."}
