Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user is prompted with the message 'Do you want to save the changes? <Yes> <No> <Cancel>'. The user should be able to easily understand how to save or discard their changes.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder). The error message 'Source page is dirty' is not clear enough.", "EB": "When the user edits the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and tries to switch back to the Layout view, they should see a clear and descriptive error message indicating that the source needs to be saved before switching views. The dialog should be titled 'Save Changes' instead of 'Error'.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view.\n3. Switch to the Layout view.\n4. Observe the error message and dialog prompt."}
