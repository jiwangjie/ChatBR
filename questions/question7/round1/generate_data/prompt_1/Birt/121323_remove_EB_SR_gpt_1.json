{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If one enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], then within the class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. When leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. However, in my opinion, treating XPath expressions in this way will lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part is entered for the column mapping.", "EB": "", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue are not provided in the bug report."}
