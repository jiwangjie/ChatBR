Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Note that the selection is stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Verify that the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
