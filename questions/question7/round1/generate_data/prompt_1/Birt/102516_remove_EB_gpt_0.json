{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This can result in several hundred tables being displayed. In the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, I can see the schema filter, however, I still receive a warning message on page load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "When the JDBC Data Set Editor is opened, there is a delay while the entire schema is queried. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should only load and display the tables and columns in the selected schema (catalog). It should not query the entire schema on page load.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open the JDBC Data Set Editor and observe the delay while the entire schema is queried. Also, notice the warning message that appears, indicating that only 500 items can be viewed in the available list. The expected behavior is that the editor should load and display only the tables and columns in the selected schema (catalog), without querying the entire schema on page load. This bug is also reported in <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/showbug.cgi?id=101372'>Bug 101372</a>, which requests the ability to filter based on schema."}
