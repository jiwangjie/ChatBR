{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer currently stores the absolute path of the library file. For example, I observed that the 'fileName' property of the report design contains the absolute path 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path. The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path of the included library. For example, if my report design is located in the directory '$project/test', and the library file 'lib1.rptlibrary' is in the same directory, the relative path should be saved as './lib1.rptlibrary'.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Create a report design in a specific directory. \n2. Include a library file that is in the same directory as the report design. \n3. Save the report design and verify that the BIRT designer saves the relative path of the included library file instead of the absolute path."}
