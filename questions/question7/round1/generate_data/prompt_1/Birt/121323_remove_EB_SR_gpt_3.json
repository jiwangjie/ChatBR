{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation object is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.

Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Confirm that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4.
