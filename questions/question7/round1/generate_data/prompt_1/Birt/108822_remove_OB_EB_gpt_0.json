{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic is needed to process disk sorting when there is a boundary value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when sorting data on disk, if there are 40,000 rows of data and the program is set to process less than 40,000 rows, the following steps are performed: 1. The file is saved as a temporary file. 2. The file is loaded into memory. 3. The data is sorted. 4. The sorted data is saved back to the temporary file.", "EB": "A more optimized logic is expected for processing disk sorting when there is a boundary value for the row value.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Set up a scenario where there are 40,000 rows of data. 2. Configure the program to process less than 40,000 rows. 3. Perform a disk sorting operation on the data. Observe the steps taken by the program and note any inefficient processing or errors encountered during the process."}
