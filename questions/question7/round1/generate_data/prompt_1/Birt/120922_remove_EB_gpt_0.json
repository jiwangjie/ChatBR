The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes when prompted with the dialog 'Do you want to save the changes?'. The options are Yes, No, and Cancel.

Additionally, the dialog is titled 'Error'.", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very clear. The error message is 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then switching back to the Layout view, the user should receive a clear error message indicating that they need to save their changes.
