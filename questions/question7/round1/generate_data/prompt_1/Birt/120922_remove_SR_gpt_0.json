{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: \"Dirty Page\" behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "The current behavior in the XML Report Designer editor is causing inconvenience to users. When editing the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor and then trying to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the changes need to be saved. The message also prompts the user with options to save, discard, or cancel their changes. However, the wording of the message is unclear and the dialog is titled as \"Error\" (including the quotes).\n\nA better and more typical approach would be to clearly state that the XML Report Design has been changed. Additionally, the dialog's title should be improved and should not contain any quotes.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor and attempting to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed stating that the changes need to be saved.
