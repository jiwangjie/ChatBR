Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "When making changes to the XML Report Design in the editor, if the user tries to switch to another page without saving the changes, a dialog pops up with the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. The dialog title is 'Error' (including the quotes).", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog with a title that indicates the unsaved changes, such as 'Unsaved Changes'. The dialog should provide clear options for the user to save, discard, or cancel the changes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Make changes to the design.\n3. Try to switch to another page without saving the changes.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. A dialog should appear with a title indicating unsaved changes.\n2. The dialog should provide options to save, discard, or cancel the changes.\n3.
