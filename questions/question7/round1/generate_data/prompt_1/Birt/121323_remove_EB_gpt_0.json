{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way could potentially lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information.

When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection should not be stripped off and should be properly stored in the filterInfo HashMap. When leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation should be persisted to .rptdesign along with the data stored in filterInfo.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check if the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
