{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "When performing extraction from a meta data object, the labels returned before extraction are null. However, after the extraction is executed, the labels become recognizable strings. This inconsistency prevents the proper display of labels to the end user. The expected behavior is for the 'getcolumnlabel' operation to return the same labels as after extraction, even before the extraction is performed.", "OB": "Labels returned before extraction are null.", "EB": "The 'getcolumnlabel' operation should return the same labels as after extraction, even before the extraction is performed.", "SR": "1. Initialize a meta data object.\n2. Call 'getcolumnlabel' before performing extraction.\n3. Verify that the labels returned are non-null and user recognizable."}
