{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand\n\nThe JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, however I still have the warning message onload since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "When using the JTOpen JDBC drivers on the iSeries platform and opening the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query, the tree control displays every schema (catalog) on the system, which results in several hundred tables being shown. The schema filter is in place, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated during load.", "EB": "The load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter, in order to improve performance and avoid the warning message on load.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the tree control displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being shown.\n3. Attempt to apply a filter or expand the tree.\n4. Notice if the load of the tree is deferred until the user takes action, and if the warning message on load is no longer present."}
