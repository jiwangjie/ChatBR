{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait until all the tables and columns are loaded. Eventually, a message saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema when it is opened. This will improve the performance and user experience.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the slow loading of tables and columns. The message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' should be displayed."}
