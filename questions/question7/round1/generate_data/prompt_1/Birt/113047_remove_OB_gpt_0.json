The expected result is that, when changing the data source, the new data source's children should be listed.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the bug: 1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement. 2. Go to the data set editor's data source page. 3. Change the data source. 4. Check if the new data source has database/table/column information listed. Actual result: No children nodes are listed when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab. To reproduce the issue, close the data set editor and reopen it."}
