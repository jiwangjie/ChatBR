{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path", "description": "When including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer is currently storing the absolute path. However, it should store the relative path instead.", "OB": "In the report design, I see that the property 'fileName' is storing the absolute path: 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "EB": "The property 'fileName' should store the relative path instead of the absolute path. For example, if the report design is located at '$project/test' and the library is located at '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary', the 'fileName' property should store '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' as the relative path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design or open an existing one.\n3. Include a library from a different location.\n4. Check the 'fileName' property of the library in the report design. It should store the relative path."}
