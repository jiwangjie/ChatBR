{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when leaving the dialog. The filter information, which includes an XPath expression with a selection part, is stored in the 'filterInfo' HashMap in the 'RelationInformation' class. However, when the dialog is closed, the data stored in the 'filterInfo' HashMap is lost. This behavior is problematic as it results in the loss of important filter information.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, including a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the 'filterInfo' HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the filter information is not persisted and is lost.", "EB": "The filter information, including the XPath expression with the selection part, should be persisted when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog. This will ensure that the filter information is retained and not lost.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, including a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'. 3. Close the dialog. 4. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog again and check if the previously entered filter information is still present in the 'filterInfo' HashMap."}
