This could involve sorting the data directly in memory and then writing it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort on disk using 40000 rows of data\n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000\n3. Save the file as a temporary file\n4. Load the file into memory\n5. Sort the data\n6. Save the sorted data back to the temporary file"}
