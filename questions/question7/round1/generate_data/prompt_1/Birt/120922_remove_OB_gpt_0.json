{"id": "120922", "title": "Dirty Page behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "In the XML Report Designer editor, when making changes in the source view and then attempting to switch back to the layout view, a dialog with the title 'Error' (including the quotes) is displayed. The dialog presents the options 'Yes' to save the changes, 'No' to discard the changes, and 'Cancel' to do nothing and remain on the source page. The current behavior requires the user to figure out how to save or discard their changes. A better and more typical approach would be for the dialog to use a better title (and certainly should not have the quotes).", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, the user receives an error message indicating that they need to save their changes.", "EB": "Upon attempting to switch back to the Layout view after making changes in the source view of the XML Report Designer editor, a dialog should be presented with a more descriptive title and without the quotes. The dialog should clearly state that the XML Report Design has been changed.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view.\n3. Try to switch back to the Layout view.\n4. Observe the error message indicating the need to save changes."}
