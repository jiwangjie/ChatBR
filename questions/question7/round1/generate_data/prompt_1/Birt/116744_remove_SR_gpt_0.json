{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When I set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML in the report, it does not affect the displayed results. ", "EB": "The report should display different results depending on the Content Type property set for the dynamic text element. For Plain, I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed. For Auto, I expect content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags. And for HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, while content 3 should be displayed literally with RTF tags. However, the report currently displays the same results regardless of the Content Type set. Please see the attached report for reference.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the provided report file. \n2. Locate the dynamic text element in question. \n3. Open the properties/settings for the dynamic text element. \n4. Set the Content Type property to Plain. \n5.
