Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for superclass), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName.\nLabel could say 'Select destination type:'.\n\nOB:\n1. Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes).\n2. Title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\n3. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\n4. Destination type can be source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.\n\nEB:\n- N/A\n\nSR:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to the dialog where the static member is being moved.\n3. Observe that the browse button is smaller than the standard button size.\n4. Proceed to the next page and check if the title is displaying 'Type not found' when it should not be.\n5. Verify that only types from the source folders of the current project are shown in the dialog.\n6. Test moving the destination type as the source type and check if refactoring shows a warning about resulting errors and makes changes in all referencing classes."}
