{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions on the text selection are distributed based on personal preference, but this should be changed. Users find it unclear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "In the context menu and if not clear, the user needs to provide clearer context.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the global menu options, not just in the Outline view. The distribution of actions on the text selection should be consistent and logical, making sure all necessary actions are easily reachable from the editor.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a block of text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available.\n4. If the action is not available, switch to the Outline view and check if the action is available there.\n5. Verify and ensure that all necessary actions are accessible from the editor without requiring a view switch."}
