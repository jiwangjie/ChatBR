Currently, some actions are distributed on a personal taste basis and it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions. We should make all actions reachable from the editor.", "OB": "When selecting text, the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" to be available when selecting text.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu.\n4. Verify if the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is available in the context menu. If not, please switch to the Outline view and check again."}
