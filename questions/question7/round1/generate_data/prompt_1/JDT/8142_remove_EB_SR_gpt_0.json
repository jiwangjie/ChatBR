I am not able to understand this issue.", "OB": "When I try to view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I am seeing the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, what does this message mean?", "EB": "When I view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant), I expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars within the project.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, open a binary project (e.g. org.apache.ant) and try to view the scoped type hierarchy. See if the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'' is displayed instead of the expected class hierarchies of the internal jars."}
