JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (e.g., a, a1, b, c, d) which are visible in the Open Type dialog. This issue should be addressed by either sorting lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter, or filtering them out completely.  I suggest implementing option a).", "OB": "The obfuscated classes (e.g., a, a1, b, c, d) are prominently displayed in the Open Type dialog.", "EB": "The obfuscated classes (e.g., a, a1, b, c, d) should not be displayed in the Open Type dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the Open Type dialog.\n2. Observe that obfuscated classes like 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd' are displayed.\n3. Expected behavior is that these obfuscated classes should be sorted after the ones that start with a capital letter or be completely filtered out. I suggest implementing option a)."}
