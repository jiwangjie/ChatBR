{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. It seems that the actions are distributed inconsistently and it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the edit menu or any other global menu.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the appropriate menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in any of the menus."}
