{"id": "4964", "title": "Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in Build 204, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED and intWidgetdispose(). I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "After typing 'button.dispose(', the automatic code assist should recognize that 'dispose()' is a better match than 'DISPOSED' and automatically insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Launch Build 204. \n2. Write SWT code that includes the line 'button.dispose('. \n3. Observe that the code assist list pops up. \n4. Notice that the code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. \n5. Delete 'DISPOSED' and start typing again. \n6. Manually select 'dispose()' from the code assist list. \n7. Verify that 'dispose()' is correctly inserted after 'button.'."}
