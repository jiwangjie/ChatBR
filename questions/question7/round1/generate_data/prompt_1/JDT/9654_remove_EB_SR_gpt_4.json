Duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\n2. The first and second columns could be merged.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n\na. The buttons are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\nd. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\na. The buttons should have an appropriate size.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, one table entry should be selected. The move buttons should be disabled until a parameter is selected.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview should display the complete name.\n\nd. The dialog size should be adjusted to fit the content, regardless of the number of parameters.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog.\n2. Check the size of the buttons.\n3. Observe the initial selection behavior.\n4. Change a parameter name to a very long one and check if the preview is cut off.\n5. Test with a method that has many parameters and observe the dialog size."}
