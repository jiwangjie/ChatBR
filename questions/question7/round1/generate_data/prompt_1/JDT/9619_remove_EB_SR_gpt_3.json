Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the superclass), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. The label could say 'Select destination type:'g. The browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes)c. The title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.e. The destination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "The browse button is too small and does not comply with the standard button sizes. The title is being used for displaying long text, resulting in misleading error messages when navigating to the next page. The dialog displays types from all source folders, regardless of their relevance to the current project. The refactoring process incorrectly warns about errors when the destination type is the same as the source type, leading to unnecessary pseudo changes in referencing classes.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Observe the size of the browse button.\n3. Observe the usage of the title field for displaying long text.\n4. Go to the next page of the dialog and observe the error message 'Type not found'.\n5. Verify that only types from the source folders of the current project are displayed in the dialog.\n6. Attempt to select the destination type as the same type as the source type and observe any warning/error messages.\n7. Check if any pseudo changes are made in the referencing classes."}
