{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When typing \"button.DISPOSED\", the code assist list automatically selects \"DISPOSED\" instead of suggesting \"dispose()\" as a better match.", "EB": "The code assist should take into account the presence of opening parentheses and suggest \"dispose()\" instead of \"DISPOSED\".", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the code editor and start typing the code: button.dispose\n2. Pay attention to the code assist list as you type.\n\nExpected result: The code assist suggests \"dispose()\" as a better match for the typed code.\n\nActual result: The code assist selects \"DISPOSED\" instead of suggesting \"dispose()\"."}
