{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using automatic code assist, 'DISPOSED' is selected instead of 'dispose()'.", "EB": "When using automatic code assist, 'dispose()' should be selected when I type '('. If 'DISPOSED' is selected, it should be case sensitive.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing '('.\n3. Observe the selected code completion suggestion.\n4. Verify that 'dispose()' is selected instead of 'DISPOSED'. If 'DISPOSED' is selected, ensure it is case sensitive in the code assist."}
