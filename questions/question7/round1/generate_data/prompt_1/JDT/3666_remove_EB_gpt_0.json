{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, code assist eats too much code. Consider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the baz call in bar to make the program correct.", "OB": "The code is changed to: baz(x.foo().foo()) I would rather it gave me baz(x.foo(), x.foo())", "EB": "The expected behavior is that code assist should suggest the correct syntax for the baz call in bar and replace the code appropriately.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Change the baz call to baz(x.x.foo()) 2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.' 3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist 4. Type 'f' to filter the list 5. Select 'foo()' from the suggested options."}
