{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When there is a mixture of tabs and spaces, the ShiftLeft functionality does not behave as expected.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when ShiftLeft is executed, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., the tab should be replaced with spaces). It is also confusing if there is a stray space, as it causes confusion and prevents the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute ShiftLeft and observe the behavior."}
