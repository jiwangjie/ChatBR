{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath/output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the user presses Ok, they receive the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem is that setting the output location and classpath is currently done as two separate operations. By setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath/output location should be offered as one operation. Similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location at once, the setting of the classpath and output location should be combined into a single operation. Additionally, the error message should be updated to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Go to the classpath/output location settings.\n3. Set the desired classpath and output location.\n4. Press Ok.\n5. Verify that the classpath and output location are set as expected and no error message related to nesting is displayed."}
