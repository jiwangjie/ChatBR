{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, code assist consumes too much code. The program needs a parameter added to the baz call in bar to make it correct. The code is as follows:\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. In the code, call the bar method on an instance of X: bar(x);\n2. Observe that the code assist suggests code completion after x.foo().\n3. Accept the code completion suggestion.\n4. Observe that too much code is replaced.\n\nExpected behavior:\nWhen accepting the code completion suggestion, only the code after x.foo() should be replaced, not the entire line.\n\nAdditional information:\n- The text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure.\n- An option was added to control the amount of source code to replace.\n- The option should be conditioned by a keystroke; pressing enter should replace until the end, and pressing insert should replace until the cursor location.\n\nNote: The bug report mentions removing the option, but it is not clear from the description when or why it was removed.", "OB": "Under certain circumstances, code assist eats too much code.
