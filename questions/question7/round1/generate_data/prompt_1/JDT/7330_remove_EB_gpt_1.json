I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste which needs to be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view in order to access certain actions.", "OB": "When I select a text, the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "When I select a text, the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the editor. \n2. Select a text. \n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu. \n4. Verify that the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not present in the context menu. \n5. Switch to the Outline view and repeat steps 2 and 3. \n6. Verify that the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is now present in the context menu."}
