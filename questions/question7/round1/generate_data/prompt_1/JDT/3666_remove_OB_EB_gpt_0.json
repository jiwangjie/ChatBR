Currently, this option is missing.", "OB": "When using the code assist feature in the provided class and following the steps below:", "EB": "The code assist should only suggest adding 'foo()' as a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' function.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1.
