{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message (1GD0L9O)", "description": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard, a confusing message appears at the top before anything is typed in the package name field. The message says 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. The user wants clarification on the meaning of this message and whether it is an error. They also suggest that if it is an error, it should be displayed in red with an error icon. Additionally, they note that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. The user also raises the question of how to create a default package, as it cannot be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the 'New Java Package' wizard and not entering anything in the package name field, a message appears at the top that says 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "The message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should either be removed or clarified to provide a better understanding of its purpose.
