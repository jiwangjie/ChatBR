{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files. These additional files can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This ambiguity leads to some users pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains additional files besides .class files, which can actually be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When creating a new project for an existing directory structure, the user should be prompted to confirm if the bin directory can be scrubbed (deleted and rebuilt). This confirmation step is necessary to prevent the misuse of pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains unnecessary files, which can be rebuilt from the .java files.", "SR": "1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Select an existing directory structure as the project's location.\n3. Choose an output directory that points to a bin directory.\n4. Upon clicking the create button, a confirmation prompt should be displayed asking if the bin directory can be scrubbed.\n5. Selecting 'Yes' should lead to the deletion and subsequent rebuild of the bin directory.\n6. Verify that only .class files are included in the rebuilt bin directory."}
