However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works properly. The Search dialog is initialized with the fully qualified name, which is causing the issue. (Java) Search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "EB": "When searching for declarations using the package view selection and dialog, the search should be able to find the expected results. The Search dialog should be initialized with the element name instead of the fully qualified name if the Java element cannot be retrieved. Searching via the context menu in the packages view should continue to work as expected.", "SR": "1. Open the package view.\n2. Select a package.\n3. Open the search dialog.\n4.
