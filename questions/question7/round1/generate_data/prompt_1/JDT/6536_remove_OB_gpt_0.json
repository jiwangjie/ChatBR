The expected behavior is that the action should add the Javadoc on the selected field. However, currently, either the menu option should be removed or the action should be fixed to add the Javadoc correctly.", "OB": "When selecting a field in the Type Hierarchy view and choosing the 'Add Javadoc' option from its context menu, no action is taken.", "EB": "After selecting a field in the Type Hierarchy view and choosing the 'Add Javadoc' option from its context menu, the Javadoc for the selected field should be added.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the Type Hierarchy view.\n2. Select a field in the view.\n3. Right-click on the selected field to open the context menu.\n4. From the context menu, choose the 'Add Javadoc' option."}
