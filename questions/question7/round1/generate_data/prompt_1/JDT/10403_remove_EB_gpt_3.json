{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should display a confirmation message indicating that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. This confirmation message should inform users that some files in the bin directory may be deleted during the process, as they can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the application\n2. Select the option to create a new project\n3. Choose an existing directory structure\n4. Point the output folder to a bin directory\n5. Proceed with the project creation process\n6. Observe the confirmation message displayed\n\nExpected result: The confirmation message should inform users that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt, and that some files in the bin directory may be deleted as they can be rebuilt from the available .java files."}
