It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab. Regardless, it is confusing when there is a stray space, as it is not clear why the text does not shift.", "EB": "Executing ShiftLeft should shift the second line to the left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the first non-whitespace character (i.e., remove the tab if present). The text should move accordingly, eliminating any confusion caused by stray spaces.", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces, ensuring both lines are visually indented the same.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n3. Verify that the second line is shifted to the left, and the first line is shifted left at least to the first non-whitespace character (i.e., remove the tab if present)."}
