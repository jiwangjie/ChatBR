The name validation is being duplicated.\nb. The first and second columns should be merged.", "OB": "The marking between the button and the list is too large. The top button is not aligned with the top of the dialog. The table lacks a label, making it difficult to identify or access its contents. Moving multiple items up/down in the list is not allowed. The signature preview is not wrapping properly. The signature preview does not have a background color set to the same color as when hovered over.", "EB": "The marking between the button and the list should be adjusted to an appropriate size. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog. The table should have a visible label for easy identification and mnemonic usage. Multiple selection should be allowed, as the move up/down functionality should be applicable to more than one item at a time. The signature preview should wrap properly. It would be beneficial if the signature preview had a background color that matched the hover color.", "SR": "1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog.\n2. Check the marking between the button and the list.\n3. Check the alignment of the top button.\n4. Look for a label for the table.\n5.
