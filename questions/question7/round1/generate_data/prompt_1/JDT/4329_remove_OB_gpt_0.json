Open the software and navigate to the Package view.\n2. Select a specific package.\n3. Right-click on the package and choose the search option.\n4. In the search dialog, enter some keywords for declarations.\n5. Click on the search button.\n6. Observe that no search results are displayed.\n\nIn contrast, search for declarations using the context menu in the packages view works as expected.\n\nAdditionally, the software should prioritize getting the Java element when searching, and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.\n\nNOTES:"}
