{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Point the output folder of the project to a bin directory. \n3. Confirm that the output directory can be deleted. \n4. Rebuild the output directory. \n5. Observe if any unexpected files remain in the output directory."}
