{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, some actions are distributed on a personal taste basis and it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view. All actions should be reachable from the editor, either through the context menu or the Edit menu.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select a piece of text and check for the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the context menu. If not found, try accessing it through the Edit menu."}
