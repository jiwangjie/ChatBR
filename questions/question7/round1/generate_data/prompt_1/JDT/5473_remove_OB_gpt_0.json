It appears that the first line is not shifted left and the second line is not shifted left at least to the first non-whitespace character.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when executing the ShiftLeft operation on two lines of text that are indented with a combination of tabs and spaces, the first line should be shifted left and the second line should also be shifted left to align with the first non-whitespace character.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4.
