It seems that currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste, which is not ideal. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be easily reachable from the editor, without forcing users to switch views.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available when selecting text in the editor. The action is only visible when switching to the Outline view.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be available when selecting text in the editor.

Observe that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu or any global menu.\n4. Switch to the Outline view.\n5. Observe that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is now visible in the context menu or global menu (e.g., Edit menu)."}
