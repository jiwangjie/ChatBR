When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off. g. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "c. The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. d. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. f. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied on more than one item. h. The signature preview must be a label that warps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "SR": ""}
