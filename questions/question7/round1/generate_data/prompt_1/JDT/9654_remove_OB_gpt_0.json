The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed, as move up/down can be applied on more than one item. The signature preview must be a label that wraps. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.", "EB": "The space between the button and the list needs to be reduced. The top button should be aligned correctly with the dialog. The table needs a label to support using a mnemonic. Enable multiple selection in the list. The signature preview should word-wrap correctly. Set the background color of the signature preview to match the hover state.", "SR": "To reproduce, change a parameter name to something very long and observe that the preview is cut off."}
