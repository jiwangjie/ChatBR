{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation confirmation missing for scrubbing bin directory", "description": "When users create a new project and specify an existing directory structure as the output folder, there should be a confirmation prompt to ensure that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project and selects an existing directory structure as the output folder, there is no confirmation prompt to ensure that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "Upon project creation, users should be prompted to confirm that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the software and navigate to the project creation screen. \n2. Select an existing directory structure as the output folder. \n3. Proceed with creating the project. Expected behavior: A confirmation prompt should appear, asking the user to confirm if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
