Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the super class), so it could be done. At least isValidTypeName.\nLabel could say 'Select destination type:'.\n\nOB: The current behavior is not mentioned in the bug report.\n\nEB: I would use the title 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'Move x fields from xx'.\nSelection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.\n\nSR: To reproduce this issue, browse offers for a type from a CU in a different project."}
