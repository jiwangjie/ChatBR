{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204. While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "The code assist should recognize that the user has typed a '(' and prioritize matching the 'dispose()' method over other options. It should not insert 'DISPOSED' by default.", "SR": "Build 204. Steps to reproduce: 1. While writing SWT code, type 'button.dispose'. 2. At this point, do not realize that the code assist list is up because you are not looking. 3. Observe that there are 2 items in the list: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()', 'voidWidget'. 4. Type '(' to complete the line as 'button.dispose();'. 5. Observe that the automatic code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of the expected 'dispose()'. "}
