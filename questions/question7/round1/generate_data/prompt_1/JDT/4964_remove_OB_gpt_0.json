{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED, which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I typed 'button.dispose', the automatically suggested completion 'DISPOSED' was inserted instead of the correct completion 'dispose()'.", "EB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the automatically suggested completion should insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "Build 204\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the SWT code editor.\n2. Type 'button.dispose'.\n3. Observe the automatic code assist suggestions.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The code assist should suggest and insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'."}
