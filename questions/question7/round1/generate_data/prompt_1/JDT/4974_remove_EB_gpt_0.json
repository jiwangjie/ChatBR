{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, the following error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations, and setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Go to the project properties. 3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
