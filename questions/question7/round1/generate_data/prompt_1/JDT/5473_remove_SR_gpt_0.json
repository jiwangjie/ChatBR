It is unclear from the specifications how this behavior should be, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least until the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). In any case, it is confusing when there is a stray space, as it is unclear why the text does not shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually indent the two lines the same way, executing ShiftLeft should shift the text as necessary. In the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least until the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). It is important to ensure that there are no stray spaces to prevent confusion about why the text does not shift.", "SR": "1.
