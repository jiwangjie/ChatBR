{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(', because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "OB": "Upon typing '(', the automatic code assist inserts the first item in the list, 'DISPOSED', instead of the expected 'dispose()'.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start typing SWT code.\n2. Type 'button.dispose'.\n3. Without looking, type '('.\n4. Observe that the automatic code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'."}
