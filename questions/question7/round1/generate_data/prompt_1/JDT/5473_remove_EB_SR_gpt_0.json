The text does not move correctly. It is confusing because it is not clear why the text won't shift. It is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character, so that both lines are indented the same visually. If there is a stray space, it should be removed.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces, so that both lines are indented the same visually.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n3. Verify that the text does not move correctly and it is not clear why the text won't shift."}
