{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the 'Ok' button is pressed, an error message appears: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue arises due to the fact that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. By setting the first option, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Go to the project properties and modify the settings to use the project itself as the source folder and output location."}
