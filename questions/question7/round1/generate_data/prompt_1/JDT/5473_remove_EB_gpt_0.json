If we replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, and then execute ShiftLeft, the text does not move as expected. It is unclear from the specification how this behavior is supposed to be, but in this scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). Additionally, if there is a stray space, it is confusing as you might not know why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After highlighting the two lines and executing ShiftLeft in a default text editor, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, removing the tab. There should be no confusion regarding why the text won't shift.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor. \n2. Type in the following:\n   <space><tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft. \n4. Observe that nothing moves as expected."}
