However, when searching for declarations, the fully qualified name is not found. Searching via the context menu in packages view works correctly. The expected behavior is that the search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are returned when using the fully qualified name.", "EB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, the correct results should be returned, displaying the element name instead of the fully qualified name if the Java element cannot be found.", "SR": "1.
