Enable word wrap in the StyledText widget.\n2. Change the text in the widget.\n3. Observe the inefficient and slow redraws that occur.\n\nTo verify the optimization, add the following line to the performPaint method ofStyledText class:\nSystem.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);"}
