The compiler does not throw a compilation error but assumes that NoClassDefFoundError is available. To resolve this issue, a private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class.", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 version uses Class.forName() which throws a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, preventing instantiation by making the constructor private would be a good practice.", "SR": ""}
