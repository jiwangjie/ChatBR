However, if I repeat steps 1) and 2), and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "Closing and reopening the file, as well as selecting 'Revert' should take a similar amount of time to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1) Open the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. \n2) Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty. \n3) Click on the close box in the editor tab. \n4) Choose 'no' when prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. \n5) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. \n6) Repeat steps 1) and 2). \n7) Right-click on the editor and select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu. \n\nExpected behavior: The contents of the window should be replaced with the original in a similar amount of time as closing and reopening the file."}
