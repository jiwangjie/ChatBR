Since there are no non-static methods in this class, making the constructor private will prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class. This change will not add any size to the codebase as the compiler automatically generates a free public constructor.", "SR": "1. Open the BidiUtil.java file in the win32 version of the application.\n2. Add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class.\n3. Save and build the application."}
