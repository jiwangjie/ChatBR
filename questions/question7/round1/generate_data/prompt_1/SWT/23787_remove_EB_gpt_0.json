Integration build 09/17. It looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On Windows, this feature appears fine. However, on motif platforms, these text fields receive automatic borders, indicating them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds that make them stand out even more.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. Instead, it should use a different UI element or design approach that avoids the issues described above.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select a Project and right-click to open the Properties dialog. Then navigate to the Info page and observe the read-only fields (e.g., Path, Type, etc.)."}
