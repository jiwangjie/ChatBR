{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the Text and Tree widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around this by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running build 20020920 and running the attached code, the left tree and text behave as expected on both Windows and Linux.", "EB": "When running build 20020920 and running the attached code, the right tree and text should behave as expected on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "1. Launch build 20020920.\n2. Run the attached code.\n3. Observe the behavior of the left tree and text.\n4. Observe the behavior of the right tree and text.\n5. Compare the expected behavior on both Windows and Linux for both sets of tree and text."}
