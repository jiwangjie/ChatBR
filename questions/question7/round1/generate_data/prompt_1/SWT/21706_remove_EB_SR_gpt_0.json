This method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This causes a problem in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "The Class.forName() usage in the BidiUtil class should be changed to remove the reflection in order to avoid the NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, 1. Run the CLDC version of SWT. 2. Trigger the code path that involves the usage of Class.forName() in the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class. 3. Observe the NoClassDefFoundError being thrown. To resolve this issue, remove the reflection usage in the BidiUtil class and replace it with an alternative implementation that does not rely on the Class.forName() method."}
