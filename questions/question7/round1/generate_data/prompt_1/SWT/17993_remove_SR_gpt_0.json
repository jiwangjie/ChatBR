{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace should not replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type is not replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is common in browsers. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.\n\nI'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When I type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what I have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, which means that the case of what I have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.\n\nFor me, it is very common to perform operations like this. I think the current behavior should be changed to something more simple which allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Open a document so that Edit > Find/Replace... becomes available.\n2. Enter text in the 'Find' field or 'Replace With' field.\n3. Observe that if the entered text matches a value from the history, it is replaced with that value.\n\nThe behavior is similar for the 'Replace With' field.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields in the Find/Replace dialog, if the entered text matches a value from the history, it gets replaced with that value.

Perform find and replace operations, ensuring that the full range of possibilities is available and the case of the entered text is respected.\n\nThe behavior should be consistent for the 'Replace With' field as well."}
