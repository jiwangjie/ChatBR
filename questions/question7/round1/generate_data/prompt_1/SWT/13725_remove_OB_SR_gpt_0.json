{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "description": "When using the java editor, I noticed that the revert operation is significantly slower compared to the close and reopen operation.", "OB": "Currently, when I try to revert a file in the java editor, it takes a considerable amount of time to complete the operation.", "EB": "However, the revert operation should ideally be as fast as the close and reopen operation, as it only involves restoring the original file contents.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a java file in the editor. \n2. Make changes to the file. \n3. Click on the 'Revert' option in the editor's menu. \n4. Observe the time taken for the revert operation. \n5. Compare the time taken for the revert operation with the time taken for the close and reopen operation."}
