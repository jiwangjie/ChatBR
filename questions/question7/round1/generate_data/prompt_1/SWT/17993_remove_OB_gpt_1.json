{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided. For me, it is very common to perform operations like this. I think the current behavior should be changed to something more simple, which allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think this feature should be removed.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the entries from previous searches are displayed as suggestions and the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "The 'Find/Replace' feature should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. It should allow users to perform find and replace operations without automatically suggesting or replacing their input. The feature should also respect the case of what the user types.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document to make the 'Edit > Find/Replace...' option available. 2. Open the 'Find' field and type 'a'. 3. Click on 'Find' to initiate the search. 4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. The typed entry should not be replaced with any value from the history and users should be able to enter any desired text."}
