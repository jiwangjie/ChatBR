{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree should get focus as expected on both Windows and Linux. The text widget should lose focus accordingly when the tree is clicked.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch the application.\n2. Navigate to the area with the Tree and the Text widget.\n3. Click anywhere in the tree.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe tree should receive focus, and the text widget should lose focus."}
