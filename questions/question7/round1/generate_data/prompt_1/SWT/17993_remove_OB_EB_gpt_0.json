{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete, which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the entries from previous searches are displayed as suggestions.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the entered text should not be replaced with suggestions from previous searches.", "SR": "1. Open the application. 2. Choose 'Edit' > 'Find/Replace...'. 3. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field. 4. Click 'Find'. 5. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field and observe if it gets replaced with a suggestion from previous searches."}
