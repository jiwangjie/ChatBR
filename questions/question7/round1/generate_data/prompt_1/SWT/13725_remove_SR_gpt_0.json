However, if I repeat steps 1 and 2, and then double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it, the file is reopened almost instantly. This behavior seems odd because reverting the file contents should not take more time than simply closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "After answering 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "The 'Revert' operation should be as fast as or faster than closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1.
