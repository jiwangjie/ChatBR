Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it is unnecessary to allow instantiation of the class. By adding a private constructor, we can prevent people from using it. This change does not increase the size of the class, as the compiler automatically provides a public constructor.", "SR": "To fix this issue, change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); Although not tested, this change is expected to achieve the same functionality."}
