", "OB": "When attempting to revert a file in the Java editor, it takes longer compared to closing and reopening the file.", "EB": "This seems odd, as the process of reverting the file contents should not take more time than simply closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1) Start by opening an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' located in the 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' source folder in the 'org.eclipse.swt' project in the open source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and press the spacebar to mark the file as dirty.\n\nOn my (fast) home machine, the following steps took approximately 8 seconds:\n- Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n- Choose 'no' when prompted to save changes.\n- Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n\nHowever, when I repeat steps 1) and 2), and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original."}
