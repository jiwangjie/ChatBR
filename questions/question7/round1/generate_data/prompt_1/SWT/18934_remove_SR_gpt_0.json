{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example are enabled but do not have any effect when moved. This is misleading, especially when opening a small image like an icon, as the scrollbars do not actually perform any scrolling action.", "OB": "Build F2 (20020602)\nRedhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only)\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved.\n3. However, the scrollbars do not have any effect or perform any scrolling action.\n4. Open a small image, such as an icon, to see that the scrollbars are just misleading as they do not do anything.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled to avoid misleading users. When opened, the scrollbars should not be movable and should not have any effect even when a small image is displayed.", "SR": "1. Launch the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Observe that the scrollbars are disabled and unable to be moved.\n3. Verify that the scrollbars do not have any effect or perform any scrolling action when moved.\n4. Open a small image, like an icon, to confirm that the scrollbars remain disabled and do not suggest any scrolling behavior."}
