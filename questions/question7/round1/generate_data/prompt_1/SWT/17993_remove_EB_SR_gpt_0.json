{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature in the F1 build is that when you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search history. If it finds a matching entry, it replaces the text you have typed with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in web browsers. However, in some scenarios, this behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations. It would be better if what I type isn't automatically replaced with a value from the history. Perhaps in the future, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When I use the Find/Replace dialog accessed through Edit > Find/Replace..., and type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the text I have typed is searched against the history of recent searches. If there is a case-insensitive match, the original text I typed is replaced with the matching value from the history. This can cause issues when trying to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "When I use the Find/Replace dialog, typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields should not automatically replace my input with values from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Find/Replace dialog through Edit > Find/Replace...\n2. Enter some text in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields\n3. Observe that if there is a case-insensitive match in the history of recent searches, the text you have typed gets replaced with the matching value from the history\n4. Verify that it is now impossible to perform find or replace operations due to the auto-replacement behavior"}
