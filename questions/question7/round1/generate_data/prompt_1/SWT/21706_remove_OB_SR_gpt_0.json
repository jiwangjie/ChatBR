This change is expected to prevent people from instantiating the class if there is no need to do so. By making the constructor private, it does not add any size, as the compiler already provides a free public constructor. The improvement here is to update the wording for clarity and completeness.", "SR": "1. Open the source code for BidiUtil in win32.\n2. Locate the constructor for the class.\n3. Replace the public constructor with a private constructor.\n4. Save the changes and recompile the code."}
