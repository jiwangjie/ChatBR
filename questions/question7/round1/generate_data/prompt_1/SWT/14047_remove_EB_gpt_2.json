Open the StyledText document in word wrap mode.\n2. Append N lines to the document.\n3. Observe that each line appended triggers a redraw of the entire client area.\n\nTo verify the issue:\n1. Add the following line to the performPaint method in StyledText:\n   System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);\n2. Compile and run the application.\n3. Repeat steps 1-3 of the reproduction steps.\n4. Observe the console output for the line count, paint Y position, and render height values during each redraw."}
