To reproduce the issue, please refer to the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. . It is important to note that these tests have limitations as they may yield false positives when detecting this error due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, it is observed that if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted from the declare warning message.", "OB": "When declaring warnings on binary files, the source path is displayed incorrectly as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.
