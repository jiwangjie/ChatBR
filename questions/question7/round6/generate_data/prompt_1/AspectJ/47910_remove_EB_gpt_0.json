{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using the ajc command with the options sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, an output file is created with a .jar extension. However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation suggests that the outjar parameter should put the output classes in a zip file, but it doesn't make sense for a parameter called outjar to create a zip file.", "OB": "When calling ajc with the options sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, the output file created with a .jar extension does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The output file created by ajc with the sourceroots and outjar options should be a valid jar file and include a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, call ajc with the sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar options and observe that the output file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
