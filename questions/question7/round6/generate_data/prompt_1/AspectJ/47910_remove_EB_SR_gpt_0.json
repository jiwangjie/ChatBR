{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When invoking ajc with the parameters `sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar`, an output file with a .jar extension is created. However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation states that the `outjar` parameter is used to create a zip file, but it doesn't make sense for a parameter named `outjar` to create a zip file instead of a proper jar file.", "OB": "When invoking ajc with the parameters `sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar`, an output file with a .jar extension is created, but it is missing the required MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The `outjar` parameter in ajc should create a valid jar file with the MANIFEST.MF file included.", "SR": "Ensure that the `outjar` parameter in ajc generates a valid jar file that contains the required MANIFEST.MF file."}
