  "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]. See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to observe the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)",
  "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" rather than \"app/Main\". I have also seen the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.",
  "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars should be listed in the form \"app/Main\" instead of \"app.Main.class\". Additionally, investigate and address the issue where filenames do not appear at all in these messages.",
  "SR": "Ensure that declare warning messages correctly display the source path for .class files from injars in the format \"app/Main\" instead of \"app.Main.class\". Investigate and resolve the issue causing filenames to be omitted from these messages."
