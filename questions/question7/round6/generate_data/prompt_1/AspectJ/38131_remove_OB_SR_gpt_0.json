This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n   package subpackage;\n   public class Test {\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n         System.out.println('Hello');\n      }\n   }\n\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe compiled classes should be placed in the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nActual Behavior:\nAfter running the above command, a directory named 'subpackage' is created within the existing 'subpackage' directory, and the compiled classes are placed inside it.\n\nExplanation:\nThe current behavior of ajc is not consistent with javac. The 'ajc' command should have the same behavior as 'javac' in this case.\n\nSuggested Resolution:\nUpdate 'ajc' to have the same behavior as 'javac' when compiling classes from a subpackage."}
