  "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]. See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to reproduce the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I observed it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes no sense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)",
  "OB": "Declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars display the source path in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is for the source path to be listed as 'app/Main' in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.",
  "SR": "1. Navigate to the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory.\n2. Run the code to reproduce the issue.\n3. Observe that in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."
