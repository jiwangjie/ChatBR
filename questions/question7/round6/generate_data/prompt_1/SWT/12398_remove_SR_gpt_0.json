This issue occurs on Windows 2000, specifically on March 26, 2002. Additionally, the tab key does not have any effect in the Help view. We should ensure that the Help view can be immediately navigated via the keyboard.", "OB": "When launching the Help view, the tab key does not actually do anything.", "EB": "We should be starting the Help view in a way that can be immediately navigated via the keyboard.", "SR": "The Help view should be launched in such a way that it can be navigated via the keyboard without the need to click on 'live' areas first."}
