{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to \"autocomplete\" which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full \"autocomplete\" feature could be provided.", "OB": "When performing find and replace operations, the current behavior is to replace the typed entry with a value from the history. This behavior should be changed to allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until this change is made, the feature should be removed. To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: 1. Open a document so that Edit->Find/Replace... becomes available. 2. Try typing in the Find field. The behavior is similar for the Replace With field.", "EB": "When performing find and replace operations, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history.
