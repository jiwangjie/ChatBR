We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the attached code, the text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus.", "EB": "When running the attached code in build 20020920, the left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux.", "SR": "Create a workaround by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree to ensure the text widget with Tree parent loses focus properly."}
