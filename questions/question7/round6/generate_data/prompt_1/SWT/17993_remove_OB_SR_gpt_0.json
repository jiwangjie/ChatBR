{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace feature in the document, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history.", "EB": "The behavior of the Find/Replace feature should be changed to something more simple which allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. The feature should respect the case of what the user types. Until then, the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open a document.\n2. Select Edit -> Find/Replace.\n3. The typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history.\n4. The behavior should be the same for the 'Replace With' field."
