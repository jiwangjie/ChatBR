{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor", "description": "When performing the revert operation in the java editor, it takes significantly longer compared to the close and reopen operation. Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Open an editor on the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2. Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3. Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n4. When prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, select 'no'.\n5. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nPerforming the close and reopen operation should be relatively fast, taking about 8 seconds.\n\nActual Behavior:\nPerforming the revert operation, by repeating steps 1 and 2 and then selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, takes around 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original."}
