  "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus",
  "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.",
  "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when clicking on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree, causing platform UI bug 2470.",
  "EB": "Build 20020920: Run the attached code. The left tree and text behave as expected on both Windows and Linux.",
  "SR": "Ensure that clicking on the tree does not shift focus away from the text widget on both Windows and Linux."
