  "OB": "The current behavior requires users to initiate interaction by clicking on specific 'live' areas before accessibility features become active.",
  "EB": "We should improve the initialization process to ensure that the Help view is accessible immediately via the keyboard, eliminating the need for users to click on specific areas to activate functionality.",
  "SR": "Ensure that the Help view is designed to be fully navigable via the keyboard from the moment it is initiated, without requiring any additional user actions."
