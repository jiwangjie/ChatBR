Integration build 09/17. The text fields in the Project Properties Info page look bad on all motif platforms. On motif platforms, these text fields get automatic borders, which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out more.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders and on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, they have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out more.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should be modified to use non-text field components instead of these text fields.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select a Project, right-click Properties, and navigate to the subsequent Info page. Observe the readonly fields (the values for Path, Type, etc.) on motif platforms as well as Solaris/AIX/HPUX."}
