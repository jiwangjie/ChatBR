{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor.", "description": "When comparing the time it takes to revert a file with the time it takes to close and reopen the file in the Java editor, it is observed that the revert operation is significantly slower. ", "OB": "The expected behavior would be for reverting the file contents to be faster or at least as fast as closing and reopening the file. However, the revert operation takes a longer time to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "This seems odd, since reverting the file contents ought not to take more time than closing and reopening the file. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. \n2) Select the end of the first line and enter a space character to mark the file as dirty. \nFrom this point, on my (fast) machine at home, it takes about 8 seconds to perform the following steps: \n- Click on the close box in the editor tab. \n- Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. \n- Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. \nHowever, if I repeat steps 1) and 2) and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.
