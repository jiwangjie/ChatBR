  "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage",
  "OB": "The current issue is related to the usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class in win32. This method is unnecessary, and its usage can lead to potential problems.",
  "EB": "To address this issue, add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, having a private constructor would prevent unnecessary instantiation. This change is beneficial to prevent people from instantiating the class when there is no need to do so. Additionally, making the constructor private instead of public doesn't add any size, as the compiler already provides a free public constructor.",
  "SR": "Ensure that the BidiUtil class in win32 no longer uses Class.forName(). Instead, implement a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instantiation. Verify that this change does not introduce any size overhead, as the compiler already includes a free public constructor."
