The tab key does not actually do anything. This causes accessibility issues. ", "OB": "The Help view should be starting in a way that can be immediately navigated via the keyboard. Currently, it requires the user to first click on a 'live' area for it to work.", "EB": "The Help view should automatically be navigable via the keyboard upon launching.
