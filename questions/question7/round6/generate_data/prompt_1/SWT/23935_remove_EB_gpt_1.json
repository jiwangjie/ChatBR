  "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus",
  "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.",
  "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree gains focus. On Linux, the text widget never loses focus when clicking on the tree. This issue is attributed to the text widget being a child of the tree, causing platform UI bug 2470.",
  "EB": "After applying the suggested workaround by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and placing it above the tree, the text widget should maintain focus appropriately regardless of the operating system.",
  "SR": "Ensure that clicking anywhere in the tree results in the tree gaining focus, and the text widget maintains focus on Linux as well. Additionally, validate the resolution of platform UI bug 2470 with the proposed workaround."
