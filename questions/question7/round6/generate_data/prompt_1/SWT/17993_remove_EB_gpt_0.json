{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. Currently, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous entry from the history matches what is being typed, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history.", "OB": "The behavior of the Find/Replace feature in the F1 build is causing issues. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous entry from the history matches what is being typed, it automatically replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior is undesired as it prevents the ability to perform find or replace operations correctly. The existing behavior feels similar to autocomplete functionality commonly found in browsers. However, in the future, it would be beneficial to implement a full autocomplete feature. Instead of replacing the typed entry, suggestions from the history should be presented for selection.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the Find/Replace feature should not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should present suggestions from the history for selection. This way, users can perform find or replace operations accurately without losing their typed entries.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by choosing Edit->Find/Replace... 2. Type 'a' into the Find field. 3. Click 'Find'. 4. Try to type 'A' into the Find field. Observe that the typed entry get replaced with the value from the history, preventing the desired find or replace operation. To fix the issue: Modify the Find/Replace feature to display suggestions from the history without automatically replacing the typed entry."}
