Build 2002071610021.", "OB": "When the Delete button is pressed, the first item on the second row is deleted. However, instead of remaining on the second row, the Launch item is moved to the first row when the deletion occurs. This is not the expected behavior. The Launch item should stay on the second row.", "EB": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Run the attached test case.\n2. Drag the Open Type coolitem to the second row (last coolItem).\n3. Drag the Launch coolitem (last coolitem on first row) to the second row, placing it after the Open Type item.\n4. Drag the Search coolitem to the second row, placing it after the Launch coolitem.\n5. Drag the Script coolitem to the second row (last coolItem on first row), placing it after the Search coolitem.\n6. Press the Delete button.\n   - This will delete the first item on the second row.\n   - Notice that the second row is removed when the deletion occurs.\n   - The second row should remain intact.", "SR": "To verify the fix, follow these steps:\n1.
