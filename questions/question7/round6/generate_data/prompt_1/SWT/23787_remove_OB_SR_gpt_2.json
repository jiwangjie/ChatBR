  "description": "Integration build 09/17. Looks bad on all motif platforms.",
  "OB": "On the Project Properties Info page, text fields are used instead of Labels, resulting in a visually unappealing appearance on all motif platforms.",
  "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should use readonly Labels instead of text fields. This change is necessary to improve the visual presentation on motif platforms. Labels should display information without allowing user input, ensuring a more polished and professional look.",
  "SR": "1. Open the Project Properties dialog. 2. Navigate to the Info page. 3. Observe that text fields are used for displaying information. 4. Expected: Readonly Labels should be used instead of text fields for a better visual presentation on all motif platforms."
