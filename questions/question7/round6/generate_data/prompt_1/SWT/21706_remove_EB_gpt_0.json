The following line in the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class causes this issue: \n\nstatic Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);\n\nTo resolve this problem, the line should be modified as follows:\n\nstatic Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);\n\nThis change removes the usage of reflection while achieving the same functionality. The proposed solution has not been tested yet, but it is expected to work correctly.", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 uses Class.forName() method which leads to a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.
