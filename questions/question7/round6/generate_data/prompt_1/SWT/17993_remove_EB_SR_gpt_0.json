{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "Currently, when using the Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build, if you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches for entries from a previous search history. If it finds a match, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. However, this behavior is not desired as it can hinder find or replace operations. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to 'autocomplete' commonly found in browsers. In the future, it may be beneficial to provide a full 'autocomplete' feature.", "OB": "In the Find/Replace dialog, when I type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application should not search and replace my entry with a value from the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The Find/Replace dialog should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history.", "SR": "Ensure that the application does not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history in the Find/Replace dialog."}
