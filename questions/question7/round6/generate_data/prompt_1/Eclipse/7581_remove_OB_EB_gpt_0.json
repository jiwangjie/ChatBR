{"id": "7581", "title": "ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\n", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, the editor displays a set of row that are name-value pairs in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the IPropertyDescriptor to create cell editors, including the ComboBoxCellEditor. The ComboBoxCellEditor is used in column two of the property sheet, and the drop-down button is supposed to appear at the right edge of the column. However, when one of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box expands to accommodate the widest item. The problem is that the drop-down button may now be too far to the right, causing it to be clipped and not visible within the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should size itself to fit the width of the property sheet column, regardless of the width of its content. The drop-down button should always be visible within the property sheet, even if the content of the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the column.", "SR": "Fix the sizing issue in the ComboBoxCellEditor so that it fits within the width of the property sheet column. Ensure that the drop-down button is always visible within the property sheet, even if the content of the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the column."}
