The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "1) Open an existing java file. \n2) Modify it (e.g., move an existing class).\n3) Click the SaveAs icon, next to the Save Icon. A dialog will appear.\n4) Browse for a valid container location.\n5) Type the filename without the extension, which isn't requested.\n6) Click Ok.\n\nObserve that the Navigator has added the file in the specified location, but the file extension is not shown.", "EB": "The file is now treated as a generic file, as opening it will show that the file is opened as text.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nThe file should be saved with the same extension as the original file unless explicitly changed.", "SR": "The SaveAs feature should preserve the file extension when saving the file unless the user explicitly specifies a different extension."}
