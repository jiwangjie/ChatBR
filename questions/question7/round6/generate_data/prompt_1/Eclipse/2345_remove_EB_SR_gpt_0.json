Create a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named test.xml.\n3. The default editor used for XML files is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content.\n4. In the Navigator, select test.xml and choose 'Open With...' / 'Default Text Editor'.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- The file test.xml should be opened in a new editor with the default text editor, as the chosen editor type is different from the already open editor.\n\nNOTES:", "EB": "To be inferred based on product knowledge.", "SR": "Investigate the issue and implement a fix so that opening a file with a different type of editor has the expected effect even if the file is already open in another editor."}
