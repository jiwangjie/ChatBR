    "title": "Bug 12906 - Opening a file in another editor when it's already opened in one editor should give an error message",
    "description": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open it in another editor should result in an error message. Currently, nothing happens when trying to open the file with a system editor in the Java Perspective. The workbench should display a warning message informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue, or an error message stating that all files must be closed first. We believe this behavior is a safety feature of the IDE to prevent external editing while a file is already opened.",
