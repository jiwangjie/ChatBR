  "OB": "When shutting down/rebooting the computer without saving, there is no prompt to save open, unsaved files. The system shuts down immediately.",
  "EB": "A prompt should appear when attempting to shut down/reboot the system with unsaved files open. It should provide options 'Do you want to save your file?' with buttons for 'Yes,' 'No,' and 'Cancel' (which halts the shutdown). Additionally, applications should be able to control shutdown/save actions or prompt their own windows, allowing users to stop the shutdown if 'Cancel' is selected.",
  "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project. \n2. Create a text file within the project and add text to it. \n3. Notice that the text file is marked as 'dirty' (unsaved). \n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select 'Shut Down' command to initiate the shutdown/reboot process. \n5. Result: No warning or dialogue box appears to prompt users to save their unsaved files before the system shuts down/reboots, causing potential loss of data in open files."
