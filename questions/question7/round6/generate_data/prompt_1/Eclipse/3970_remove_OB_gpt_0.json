However, since the end product is a Unix product, new files should have Unix line delimiters regardless of the platform they are created on.", "EB": "Therefore, there should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for line delimiters should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be used by all plugins to ensure consistent line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "Consider the following scenario: Unix and Windows workstations are used to develop a Unix product/program."}
