The expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed in the workbench, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, indicating that all files should be closed first before opening the selected file in another editor. This is believed to be a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).", "EB": "However, there should be a warning message or an error message displayed in the workbench when attempting to open a file that is already opened in another editor.", "SR": ""}
