{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When the view, such as the Navigator, is resized smaller on Linux using build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000), the tool items, including the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X), move below the label. This behavior can confuse users as they expect the close button to remain on the same line as the label.", "EB": "Previously, these two tool items used to stay on the same line as the label regardless of how small the view became. This change in behavior may lead to usability issues, as users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner.", "SR": "Ensure that the close button and the pulldown menu icon remain on the same line as the label, even when the view is resized smaller. This will maintain consistency and prevent confusion for users."}
