In the \"Export\" dialog window, select both projects created earlier.\n2. Give the zip file a name (such as test.zip) and begin exporting to the zip file.\n\nResults: An error message box pops up stating that problems were encountered during export, and the detail lists the file of the same name in project 2 (i.e. 'foo.txt') as the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior: The zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories.", "OB": "When exporting multiple files with the same file name but from different directories to a zip file, the export process fails. An error message is displayed during the export process, indicating that there are problems with a file of the same name in one of the projects.", "EB": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the \"Export\" dialog window.\n2. Select multiple files with the same name but from different directories.\n3. Specify a name for the zip file.\n4. Initiate the export process.\n\nAfterward, an error message should be shown, indicating that there are problems with one of the files having a conflicting name in a different directory.", "SR": "The export process should be modified to handle multiple files with the same name but from different directories. The user should not encounter any error and the zip file should include all the files with their respective directory structure intact."}
