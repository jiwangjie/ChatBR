A user interface (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for the line delimiter should include Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be used by all plugins to ensure consistent line delimiters for new files.", "SR": ""}
