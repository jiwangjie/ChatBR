  "description": "Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] If a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open it in another editor does not display a warning or error message as expected.",
  "OB": "When a file is opened in one editor, switching to the Java Perspective and attempting to open the same file by double-clicking on it does not trigger any response. Subsequently, right-clicking on the Java file and selecting 'Open With' -> 'System Editor' also does not produce any result. There is no warning message indicating that overwriting changes is possible, nor is there an error message suggesting that all files should be closed first. It seems to be a safety feature preventing external editing while the file is already open in the Workbench (WSAD).",
  "EB": "Upon attempting to open a file in another editor that is already open in one editor, the Workbench should display a warning message indicating the possibility of overwriting changes. Alternatively, an error message should prompt the user to close all instances of the file before proceeding.",
  "SR": "1. Open a file in one editor within the Workbench.\n2. Switch to the Java Perspective.\n3. Double-click on the same file to open it in another editor.\n4. Right-click on the Java file and choose 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n5. Observe the absence of any warning or error message. The Workbench should provide a warning about potential changes being overwritten or an error message instructing the user to close all instances of the file before proceeding."
