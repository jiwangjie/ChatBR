Ensure that a Java file is associated with a Windows editor.\n2. Open the Java Perspective.\n3. Double click on a Java file to open it in the workbench.\n4. Right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor' - a notepad or wordpad window will open with the Java file.\n5. Close the notepad or wordpad window.\n6. Double click on the Java file to open it again in the workbench.\n7. Right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected behavior: A warning message should be displayed informing the user that there are unsaved changes and asking if they want to continue, or an error message should be displayed indicating that the file needs to be closed before opening it in another editor.\n\nThis behavior is likely a safety feature in which the IDE doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in the IDE."}
