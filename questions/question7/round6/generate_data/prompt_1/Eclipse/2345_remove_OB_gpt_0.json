Open a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml'.\n3. Select 'test.xml' in the Navigator.\n4. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'.\n5. Verify that a new editor is opened on the file, considering the different editor type.\n\nNOTES: The current behavior is incorrect as it reactivates the existing editor instead of opening a new one based on the editor type."}
