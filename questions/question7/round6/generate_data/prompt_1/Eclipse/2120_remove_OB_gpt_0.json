{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120 - MRU File List is not persisted between sessions", "description": "The MRU (Most Recently Used) file list in the File menu is not persisted between sessions. This means that when the user closes the workbench and reopens it, the previously opened files do not appear in the MRU list. It is expected that the MRU list should be saved and restored between sessions. The current implementation should make use of the IPersistableElement interface instead of directly accessing the underlying resource. It is important to note that the IEditorInput may not necessarily be a resource.", "OB": "The MRU file list should be persisted between sessions, so that when the user reopens the workbench, the previously opened files automatically appear in the File menu MRU list.", "EB": "Currently, when the workbench is restarted, the previously opened files do not appear in the File menu MRU list.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start the workbench. \n2. Open 2 or 3 files. \n3. Shutdown the workbench. \n4. Restart the workbench."}
