  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...",
  "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet, resulting in improper display.",
  "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as DialogCellEditor (Button always visible). I will need to investigate to determine if this is an issue with our implementation or with SWT.",
  "SR": "1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Activate a cell that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe the incorrect sizing of the combo box in relation to the property sheet column width."
