  "description": "Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] If file is already opened in one editor, cannot open in another editor (should give error msg)",
  "OB": "While working in the Java Perspective, if a file is opened in one editor and you attempt to open the same file by double-clicking on it, or by right-clicking and selecting 'Open With' -> 'System Editor', nothing happens. The expected behavior is to receive a warning message in the workbench, indicating that you may overwrite changes, and prompting whether you want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, instructing the user to close all files first. It seems to be a safety feature preventing external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed when attempting to open a file that is already opened in another editor. The message should inform the user about the possibility of overwriting changes and ask whether they want to continue.",
  "SR": "1. Open a Java file in the Java Perspective by double-clicking on it.\n2. Right-click on the same Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n3. Observe that no warning or error message is displayed. The expected behavior is to receive a warning message about overwriting changes and be prompted to confirm the action."
