{"id": "14197", "title": "Bug 14197: Removing a working set immediately makes changes", "description": "When removing a working set, changes are immediately applied without confirmation or cancellation.", "OB": "Currently, when a working set is deleted, the package view in the background immediately refilters. Additionally, when pressing 'cancel' during the working set selection dialog, the changes made to working sets are not reverted.", "EB": "The package view should only be refiltered when the working set selection dialog is closed, not while manipulating the working set. Pressing 'cancel' should cancel all changes made to working sets, including the removal of the working set.", "SR": "Please modify the behavior of working set removal to only apply changes when confirmed, and provide the option to cancel the removal process by pressing 'cancel' during the working set selection dialog."}
