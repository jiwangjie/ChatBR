  "title": "Incorrect 'Build' Popup Action Enablement",
  "description": "The 'Build' action in the context-sensitive popup menu within the Java perspective appears enabled consistently, despite configuring 'Perform build automatically on resource modification' in Preferences > Workbench. This behavior seems incorrect.",
  "OB": "The 'Build' action in the context-sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective is always enabled. Even if the user goes to Preferences > Workbench and selects 'Perform build automatically on resource modification', the 'Build' menu option still appears in the Java popup menus. I believe this is incorrect.",
  "EB": "The 'Build' action should reflect the preference set in Preferences > Workbench. If 'Perform build automatically on resource modification' is selected, the 'Build' option should be disabled in the Java popup menus accordingly.",
  "SR": "1. Open the Java perspective.\n2. Go to Preferences > Workbench.\n3. Select 'Perform build automatically on resource modification'.\n4. Verify the context-sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective to confirm the 'Build' action is disabled as per the preference setting."
