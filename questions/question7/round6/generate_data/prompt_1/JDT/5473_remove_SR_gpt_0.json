To reproduce the issue, replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually. Then, execute the ShiftLeft operation. The text does not move as expected. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the position of the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). At any rate, it is confusing if there is a stray space, as it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces to ensure consistent indentation, executing the ShiftLeft operation should properly shift the lines. Currently, the ShiftLeft operation does not handle intermixed tabs and spaces correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior. It is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the position of the space character (i.e., remove the tab). This improvement would make the behavior more consistent and prevent confusion when encountering stray spaces.", "SR": ""}
