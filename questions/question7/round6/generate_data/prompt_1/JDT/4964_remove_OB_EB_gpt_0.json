{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED', which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "The automatic code assist feature in the SWT IDE does not consider the context of the code being typed and inserts incorrect suggestions.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should analyze the context and prioritize suggestions that match the typed code better.", "SR": "In build 204, I encountered an issue while writing SWT code. Upon typing 'button.dispose', I did not notice that the code assist list was up since I was not looking."}
