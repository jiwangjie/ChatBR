The problem here is that setting the output location and classpath are being treated as separate operations, resulting in an illegal state when the output location is set first.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project itself as the source folder and output location."}
