I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. BTW, what does the message mean?", "OB": "When hitting F4 on a binary project selection, the class hierarchies of the internal jars are not displayed and the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'' is shown.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when hitting F4 on a binary project selection, the class hierarchies of the internal jars should be displayed.", "SR": "Investigate and fix the issue causing the lack of scoped type hierarchy on binary projects when hitting F4. Additionally, clarify the meaning of the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant''. "}
