{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to add an exception breakpoint, canceling the operation does not have any effect. The progress dialog closes immediately and eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. The cancel button should either be disabled or the cancellation request should be honored. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, set the cancelable parameter to false.", "OB": "When canceling the operation of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog should close and the action should be cancelled. The exception list should not be displayed.", "EB": "When canceling the operation of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog immediately closes without displaying the exception list. The cancel button should be disabled or the cancellation request should be honored.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the J! button to add an exception. 3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
