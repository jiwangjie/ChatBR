  "description": "",
  "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files. These additional files can be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "EB": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm that the bin directory can be scrubbed",
  "SR": "Ensure that during project creation, a validation step is added to confirm the ability to delete and rebuild the output directory. This validation should specifically check for cases where the output folder is directed to a bin directory, ensuring it contains only .class files that can be regenerated from the available .java files."
