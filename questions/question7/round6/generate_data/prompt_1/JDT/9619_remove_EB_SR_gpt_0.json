{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details 20020212a.\n\nMnemonics.\nNo validation on the type field.\nType existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the superclass), so it could be done.\nAt least isValidTypeName.\nLabel could say 'Select destination type:'.", "OB": "The browse button is too small. It should use SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\nTitle is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\nOnly types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\nDestination type can be source type. Refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudochanges in all referencing classes.", "EB": "Please provide more details regarding what specifically needs to be improved or fixed in the dialog details.\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue.\nInclude any error messages or logs that you encountered.", "SR": "Investigate the browse button size issue and update it to use SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\nFix the logic to display only types from the source folders of the own project in the dialog.\nAddress the misleading warning message and pseudochanges made during refactoring.\nValidate the type field to ensure a valid type name is entered.\nProvide a clear title for when long text is displayed, especially when transitioning to the next page.\nEnsure the label in the dialog prompts the user to select a destination type."}
