{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed inconsistently which is confusing to users. All actions should be easily accessible from the editor, either through the context menu or other global menus. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views to access certain actions.", "OB": "The bug occurs when the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "Ensure that the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is added to the context menu on text selection."}
