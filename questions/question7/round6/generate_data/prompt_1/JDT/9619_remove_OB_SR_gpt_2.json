  "OB": "The current behavior lacks mnemonics for certain elements, and there is no validation on the type field.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is to include mnemonics for all elements and implement validation on the type field. The label should be modified to 'Select destination type.'",
  "SR": "1. Open the 'Move static field(s)' dialog.\n2. Observe the absence of mnemonics for elements and lack of validation on the type field.\n3. Enter a type in the type field and verify the absence of validation.\n4. Modify the label to 'Select destination type.'\n5. Save changes and re-open the dialog to ensure the changes persist."
