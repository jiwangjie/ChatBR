{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before typing anything, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message is unclear and confusing because the package name field is empty at this point. It is unclear whether this is an error or a warning. It is suggested that if this message is indeed an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. Additionally, when the package name field is empty, there should be no error message and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. It is also important to note that there seems to be an issue with creating a default package as it can't be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before typing anything, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message is confusing when the package name field is empty.", "EB": "The confusing message stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should be removed or clarified to provide better guidance. The error message should be displayed in red with the appropriate error icon, if it is indeed an error. When the package name field is empty, there should be no error message and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. It should be possible for the user to create a default package during the creation of a new Java project.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a new Java Project. 2. Select the project. 3. Open the New Package Wizard."}
