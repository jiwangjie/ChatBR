{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The application should check if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt before allowing the user to create a new project. This is especially important when the output folder is pointed to a bin directory that may contain additional files besides .class files. A confirmation message should be displayed to ensure the user understands the consequences.", "SR": "1. Prior to allowing the user to create a new project, check if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt.\n2. If the output folder is pointed to a bin directory, display a confirmation message highlighting that files other than .class files might be deleted during the process.\n3. Allow the user to proceed with project creation only if they confirm they understand the consequences of deleting and rebuilding the output directory."}
