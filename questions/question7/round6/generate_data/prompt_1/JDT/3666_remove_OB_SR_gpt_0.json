{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - CodeCompletion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances code assist eats too much code. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the baz call in bar to make the program correct. Steps: 1. UI can decide whether it wants to use the code assist end position (until the end of current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, so as to control the amount of source to replace. Removing code assist option.", "OB": "When using code completion, under certain circumstances, it results in replacing more code than necessary. Specifically, in the 'bar' method, the code assist replaces the entire 'baz(x.foo())', which is incorrect.", "EB": "The incorrect code that is currently replaced by code completion is: 'baz(x.foo());'. It should instead be 'baz(x.foo()x.foo());'.", "SR": "To fix this issue, the code completion should be changed to replace the code with 'baz(x.foo()x.foo());'. Additionally, the option for code assist should be conditioned by a keystroke. Pressing 'enter' should replace until the end, while pressing 'insert' should only replace until the cursor location."}
