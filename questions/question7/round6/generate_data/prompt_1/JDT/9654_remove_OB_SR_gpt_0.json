Duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page.\n2. The first and second column could be merged.\n\n", "OB": "1. There is a large marking between the button and the list. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog.\n2. The table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic.\n3. Multiple selection should be allowed as 'Move Up'/'Move Down' action can be applied on more than one item.\n4. The signature preview should be a label that wraps text.\n5. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover effect.", "EB": "1.
