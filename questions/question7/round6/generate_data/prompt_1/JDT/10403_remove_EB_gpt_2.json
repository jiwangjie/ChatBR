  "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed",
  "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "OB": "After creating a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or warning about the potential deletion of the output directory. Users may not be aware that the output directory could contain important files other than .class files.",
  "EB": "Upon creating a new project, there should be a confirmation prompt or warning ensuring that the output directory can be deleted and subsequently rebuilt. This ensures that users are aware of the potential loss of data in the output directory and can take necessary precautions.",
  "SR": "1. Open the IDE and choose to create a new project.\n2. Select an existing directory structure as the project location.\n3. Verify that there is no confirmation or warning about the potential deletion of the output directory.\n4. Suggest adding a confirmation prompt or warning in the project creation process to address this issue."
