{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the IDE is consuming too much code. This issue can be reproduced with the following steps:\n\n1. Open the provided class X.\n2. In the method bar, add a parameter to the baz call to make the program correct. The modified code should be:\n\n   baz(x.foo().foo())\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nInstead of replacing the entire code, the code assist should only replace part of the code, leaving the rest intact. So the expected code after using code assist should be:\n\n   baz(x.foo(), x.foo())", "OB": "The code is changed to:\n\n   baz(x.foo(), x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n    void bar(X x) {\n        baz(x.foo());\n    }\n\n    int foo() {\n        return 5;\n    }\n\n    void baz(int i, int j) {\n    }\n}", "EB": "Currently, the code assist feature replaces the entire code instead of partially replacing it. The expected behavior is that code assist should replace only the necessary part of the code while leaving the rest unchanged.", "SR": "Modify the code assist feature to only replace the necessary part of the code, leaving the rest intact."}
