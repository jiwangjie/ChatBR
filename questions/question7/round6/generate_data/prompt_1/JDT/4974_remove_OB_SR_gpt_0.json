{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the setting of classpath and output location is done separately. To improve usability, these operations should be combined into one. This would make it more efficient for users to manage their project settings.", "EB": "Currently, users have to set the classpath and output location separately. The proposed improvement is to provide an option to set both the classpath and output location in a single operation. This would simplify the process and make it more convenient for users.", "SR": "Implement a feature that allows users to set the classpath and output location together in a single operation. Update the error message to display a more accurate error when attempting to nest a directory within itself."}
