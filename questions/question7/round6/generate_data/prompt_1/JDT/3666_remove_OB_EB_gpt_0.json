This issue can be reproduced by following the steps below:\n\n1. Open the enclosed class.\n2. Locate the call to 'baz' in the 'bar' method.\n3. Add a parameter to the 'baz' call to correct the program.\n\nThe expected behavior is that the code assist should only replace the necessary source code. However, in this case, it is consuming more code than necessary.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Place the cursor after the first 'x.' in the 'baz' call.\n2. Press Ctrl+Space to activate the code assist feature.\n3. Type 'f' to filter the list.\n4. Select 'foo()'.", "OB": "The code assist feature consumes excessive code and replaces more code than necessary.", "EB": "The code assist feature should only replace the necessary source code.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method should be changed to 'baz(x.x.foo())'."}
