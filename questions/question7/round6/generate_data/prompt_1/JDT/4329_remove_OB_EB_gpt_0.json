Specifically, when searching via the Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X), no results are displayed.", "EB": "The search functionality should return results when searching via the Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X).", "SR": "To fix this issue, the search functionality should be modified to properly retrieve and display the desired results. Specifically, when searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X), the functionality should first attempt to retrieve the Java element. If it fails to do so, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name."}
