{"id": "4121", "title": "Bug 4121 - JarExporter causes out of Sync", "description": "When using the JarExporter, the application becomes out of sync. This occurs due to the exported jar file including itself. The issue can be reproduced by following the steps below:\n\n1. Enable JarExporter in the application.\n2. Export the application as a jar file.\n3. Run the exported jar file.\n\nAs a result, the application will go out of sync. The expected behavior is that the exported jar file should not include itself.", "OB": "The exported jar file includes itself, causing the application to become out of sync.", "EB": "The exported jar file should not include itself in order to prevent the application from going out of sync.", "SR": "Exclude the exported jar file from including itself when using the JarExporter."}
