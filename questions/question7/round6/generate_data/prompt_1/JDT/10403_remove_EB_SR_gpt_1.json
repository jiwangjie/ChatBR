  "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed",
  "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files, and can be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, weshould confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt.Some users are creating projects & pointing the output folder at a bindirectory which contains more than just .class files which can be rebuilt fromthe available .java files.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that, upon project creation, the system should present a confirmation prompt to the user, ensuring that the output directory (bin directory) can be safely deleted and rebuilt. This confirmation should consider scenarios where the bin directory contains more than just .class files.",
  "SR": "To address this issue, implement a confirmation mechanism in the project creation workflow that checks for the contents of the bin directory. Provide clear instructions or warnings to the user if the bin directory contains files beyond .class files. Additionally, enhance the documentation to guide users on proper project setup and directory configurations to avoid potential issues."
