  "description": "Bug 10022: Incorrect \"Build\" popup action enablement.",
  "OB": "The \"Build\" action in the context-sensitive popup menu is always enabled in the Java perspective.",
  "EB": "If a project has already been built, the 'Build' action in the context-sensitive popup menu should be automatically disabled to avoid unnecessary manual builds. Currently, there seems to be an issue where the 'Build' action remains enabled even when a build is already done. This behavior needs to be corrected.",
  "SR": "Ensure that the 'Build' action in the context-sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective is only enabled when there is a need for a build, and it should automatically disable when a build is already completed."
