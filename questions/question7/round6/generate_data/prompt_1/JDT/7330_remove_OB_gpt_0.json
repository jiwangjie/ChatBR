{"id": "7330", "title": "Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference, which is confusing for users. It is not clear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views in order to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be easily accessible on text selection, without the need to switch to the Outline view. All relevant actions should be available in the editor or a global menu, such as the Edit menu.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available directly on the text selection, either in the context menu or via the Edit menu.", "SR": "Please make sure that all actions, including 'Add Javadoc Comment', are accessible to users when they select text. These actions should be available in the context menu and/or the Edit menu."}
