  "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When attempting to set the classpath or output location, the current behavior is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected errors. The error message is unclear and does not provide meaningful information.",
  "EB": "The behavior should be modified so that setting the classpath or output location is treated as a single operation. This aligns with the validation process, where both classpath and output location are checked simultaneously. Additionally, improve the error message to be more informative, for example: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.",
  "SR": "1. Open the application. 2. Navigate to the settings for setting the classpath or output location. 3. Observe the current behavior, which may include inconsistent results or unclear error messages. 4. Implement the change to ensure that setting classpath or output location is a unified operation. 5. Verify that the error messages are improved and provide meaningful information, such as the example mentioned."
