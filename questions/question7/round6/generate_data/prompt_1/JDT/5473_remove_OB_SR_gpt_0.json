The text doesn't shift as expected and there is confusion when there is a stray space.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually, executing the ShiftLeft operation should shift the second line left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). This will eliminate confusion and ensure the text shifts as desired.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, modify the ShiftLeft functionality to handle intermixed tabs and spaces properly. When executing ShiftLeft, ensure that the first line is shifted left at least until the space character, removing any tabs. Additionally, the second line should be shifted left as expected. This will provide consistent behavior and eliminate confusion when using ShiftLeft with tabs and spaces."}
