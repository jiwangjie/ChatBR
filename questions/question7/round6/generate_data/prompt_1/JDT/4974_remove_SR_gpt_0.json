The problem is that setting the output location and classpath are currently treated as two separate operations. By setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "Bug 4974 Set classpath / output location should be one operation. Similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location at once, the setting of classpath and output location should be offered as a single operation. Please note that the error message appears to be incorrect. It should state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
