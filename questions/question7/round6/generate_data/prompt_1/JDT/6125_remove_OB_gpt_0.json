{"id": "6125", "title": "Bug 6125: JAR packager reports open files very late", "description": "When pressing 'Finish' in the JAR packager, the following error occurs: 'JAR creation failed: Unsaved Editors'5.", "OB": "The JAR packager is not allowing the creation of a JAR file with unsaved editors. If there are open files that have unsaved changes, the packager should either allow the creation of the JAR file or display a dialog prompting the user to save the changes.", "EB": "The JAR packager should allow the creation of a JAR file even if there are open files with unsaved changes. If there are unsaved changes, the packager should display a dialog prompting the user to save them before proceeding with the JAR creation. If the user chooses not to save the changes, the packager should proceed with the JAR creation using the unsaved editors.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a file and make changes without saving. 2. Open the JAR packager for the corresponding project. 3. Fill in all the required fields (path, destination, name, description, etc.) in the packager. 4. Attempt to create the JAR file. "}
