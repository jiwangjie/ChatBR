{"id": "4329", "title": "Search results not displayed when searching via Package view selection and dialog", "description": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog on the system with ID 1GLDN1X, no results are displayed. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly. The issue seems to be that the Search dialog in the package view initializes with the fully qualified name, which is not found when searching for declarations. The expected behavior is that the search should first attempt to get the Java element and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "The package view initializes the Search dialog with the fully qualified name, causing no results to be displayed when searching for declarations. Search functionality via the context menu in packages view, however, works correctly.", "EB": "The Search dialog in the package view should be modified to initialize with the element name instead of the fully qualified name when performing a search for declarations. This will ensure that the search results are displayed correctly.", "SR": "1. Modify the package view search functionality to initialize the Search dialog with the element name instead of the fully qualified name.\n2. Update the search algorithm to first attempt to get the Java element and only display the fully qualified name if getting the element fails."}
