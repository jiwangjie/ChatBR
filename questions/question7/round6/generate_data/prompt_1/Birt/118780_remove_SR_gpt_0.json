Open the expression builder. 2. Select a dataset. 3. Double click on the first column name. The original column name should not appear below the expression builder, and the alias name should appear as row['column1'] after double clicking the original name.", "SR": "The bug needs to be fixed so that when selecting a dataset in the expression builder, the alias name is used instead of the original name when double clicking on a column name."}
