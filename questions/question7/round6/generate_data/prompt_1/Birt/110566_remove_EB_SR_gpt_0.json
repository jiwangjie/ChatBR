The expected behavior is for the data set to return the correct result based on the filter expression.", "EB": "The data set should handle invalid filter expressions for 'row[0]' properly and either return the correct result or provide an appropriate error message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set a filter in the data set using the expression 'row[0] equals to '\n2. Click on the 'Preview' tab\n\nActual result:\nThe first result record is returned when previewing the data set\n\nExpected result:\nAs explained by the developer, 'row[0]' can only be generated after all the data has been fetched. Therefore, 'row[0]' should not be used as a filter expression."}
