{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which could easily be several hundred tables. Currently, the tree is being populated on page load, causing a warning message to appear. This behavior should be changed so that the tables and columns are loaded on demand.", "OB": "Currently, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control is populating all tables and columns on page load, causing a warning message to appear. This is an issue on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, where there are several hundred tables. The tree control should be modified to load tables and columns on demand, rather than on page load.", "EB": "Modify the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control to load tables and columns on demand, instead of populating them all on page load. This change will prevent the warning message from appearing and improve performance on systems with a large number of tables, such as the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers.", "SR": "1. Modify the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor to only load tables and columns when requested by the user.\n2. Remove the warning message that currently appears on page load due to the large number of tables on the iSeries platform.\n3. Test the changes on both the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers and other supported platforms to ensure compatibility and performance improvements."}
