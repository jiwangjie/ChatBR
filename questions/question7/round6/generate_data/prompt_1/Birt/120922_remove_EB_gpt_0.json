{"id": "120922", "title": "Dirty Page behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor in the XML Report Designer, and then trying to switch back to the Layout view, the user encounters an error message indicating the need to save the changes. The error message states, 'Source page is dirty.' This presents a problem because the user is left to figure out how to save or discard the changes, and the error message itself is not very clear. Additionally, the dialog box displaying this message is titled 'Error.'", "OB": "If the user makes changes to the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and attempts to switch back to the Layout view, they are presented with an error message indicating the need to save the changes. This leaves the user unsure about how to proceed with saving or discarding the changes. The error message displayed is 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor in the XML Report Designer, and then attempting to switch back to the Layout view, the user should be provided with clear options to save or discard the changes. Additionally, the error message should be improved to clearly communicate that the user needs to save the changes before switching views. The dialog box title should also be changed to something more informative than just 'Error.'", "SR": "The XML Report Designer should be updated to enhance the user experience when editing in the 'source' view. Clear options should be provided to help the user save or discard changes when attempting to switch back to the Layout view. The error message displayed should be improved to clearly instruct the user to save the changes before switching views. The dialog box title should be changed to provide more context and clarity."}
