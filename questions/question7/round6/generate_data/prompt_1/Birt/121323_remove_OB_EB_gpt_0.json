{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When leaving the dialog in XML Edit Data Set, RelationInformation gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. This is because the XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog is not being persisted when leaving the dialog.", "EB": "The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog should be persisted when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "Modify the XML Edit Data Set dialog to ensure that the filter information entered by the user is properly persisted when leaving the dialog."}
