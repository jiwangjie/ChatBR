{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "The dynamic text element's Content Type property does not have any effect on the displayed results.", "EB": "Regardless of whether I set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML, the report continues to display the same results. The expected behavior is as follows: \n\n- For Plain, the literal content (including tags) should be displayed.\n- For Auto, content 1, 2, and 3 should appear properly without any HTML or RTF tags.\n- For HTML, content 1 and 2 should appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 should appear as is with RTF tags. The attached report demonstrates this issue.", "SR": "I have a database field that contains three types of content:\n\n1) HTML text within <html>...</html> tags.\n2) HTML fragments not within <html> tags.\n3) Text with RTF tags.\n\nI am using a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field."}
