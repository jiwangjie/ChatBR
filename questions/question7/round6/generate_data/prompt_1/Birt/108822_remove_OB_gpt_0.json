{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient disk sorting logic needed when there is a border value for row value", "description": "Currently, the disk sorting process is not efficient when there is a border value for the row value. This can be improved by implementing a logic that sorts the data directly in memory before writing it to the file. This will enhance the overall performance of the program.", "OB": "Currently, the program does not handle disk sorting efficiently when there is a border value for the row value.", "EB": "The program should implement a more efficient logic for disk sorting when there is a border value for the row value. Specifically, it should sort the data directly in memory before writing it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Set the program to sort on disk.\n2. Have a dataset of 40000 rows.\n3. Configure the program to process the data less than 40000 rows.\n4. Observe the following operations:\n   a. The file is saved as a temp file.\n   b. The file is read into memory.\n   c. Sorting is performed on the data.\n   d. The sorted file is saved as a temp file."}
