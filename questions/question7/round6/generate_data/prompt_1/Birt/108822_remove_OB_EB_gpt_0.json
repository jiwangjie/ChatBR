{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic needed for processing disk sorting when there is a border value for row value", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "When performing disk sorting, if we sort a dataset containing 40000 rows and set the program to process only a subset of the data (less than 40000 rows), the current logic does the following operations: 1. Saves the file as a temporary file, 2. Loads the file into memory, 3. Performs sorting on the data, 4. Saves the sorted data back to the temporary file."}
