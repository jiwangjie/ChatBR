{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. Eventually, it shows a message saying, 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. This bug report suggests that the load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "The loading of tables and columns in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "EB": "Currently, when the JDBC Data Set Editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load.

This will improve the performance of the editor and prevent delays for the user. Additionally, consider implementing the feature requested in bug 101372 to allow filtering based on schema."}
