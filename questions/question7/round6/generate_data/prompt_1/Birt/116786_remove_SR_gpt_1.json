  "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "The current behavior shows that the report design stores an absolute path. For instance: <property name=\"fileName\"/>E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property><property name=\"namespace\">lib1</property>",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that Bug 116786 is addressed, and when a library is included in a report design using BIRT designer, the tool should generate and store the relative path. For example, if my report design is in $project/test, the saved path should be relative, like $project/test/lib1.rptlibrary.",
  "SR": "1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library in the report.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Verify that the path stored for the included library is relative to the project."
