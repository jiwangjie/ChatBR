Create a label.\n2.

However, based on the bug report title and description, it can be inferred that when the font size of a label is modified, the label's height does not adjust to accommodate the new font size.", "EB": "Upon modifying the font size of a label, the label's height should immediately adjust to properly display the text at the new font size.", "SR": "To fix this issue, the code related to label height calculation needs to be modified so that it dynamically adjusts the height when the font size is changed."}
