  "OB": "When including a library in a report design using BIRT designer, the system fails to generate and save the relative path correctly.",
  "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path for the included library in the report design. For example, if the report design is in $project/test, the relative path should be correctly stored.",
  "SR": "1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design in a directory, for instance, $project/test.\n5. Close and reopen the BIRT designer.\n6. Attempt to access the included library, observing the failure to generate and save the relative path correctly."
