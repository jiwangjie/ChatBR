The error message is not clear and does not provide guidance on how to save or discard the changes. The dialog box is titled as \"Error\" and includes quotes. It would be more user-friendly to provide a clearer message and use an appropriate title for the dialog box.", "OB": "The user encounters an error message when attempting to switch from the XML source view to the Layout view without saving changes. The error message states that the \"Source page is dirty\" but does not provide clear instructions on how to save or discard the changes.", "EB": "Instead of the current error message, a more informative and actionable message should be displayed when switching views after making changes. The title of the dialog box should be improved and should not include quotes.", "SR": "Improve the error message when switching views after making changes in the XML Report Designer. Provide clear instructions on how to save or discard changes. Update the title of the dialog box to something more appropriate and remove the quotes."}
