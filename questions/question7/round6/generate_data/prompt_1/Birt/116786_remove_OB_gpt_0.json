{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should correctly generate and save the relative path. For example, if my report design is located in $project/test and I include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "OB": "The BIRT designer is not generating or saving the relative path correctly when including libraries in a report design.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and store the relative path when including libraries in a report design.", "SR": "Modify the BIRT designer to correctly generate and save the relative path when libraries are included in a report design. Verify this functionality by including a library from a different directory and checking that the relative path is saved correctly."}
