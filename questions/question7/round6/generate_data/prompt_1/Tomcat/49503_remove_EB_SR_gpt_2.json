{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. The first instance starts successfully. When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960.\n\nThe second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.\n\nActual behavior:\nThe exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "The connector does not try to bind to the port until the start() method is called. The startup sequence proceeds without throwing an exception, but eventually fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connector should bind to the port during the Catalina.load() phase, instead of waiting until the start() method is called. This will ensure that the startup sequence does not encounter an error in Server.await().", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully.\n2. Run Tomcat with jsvc, making sure to use a privileged port (e.g., port 80).\n3. Start a second instance of Tomcat.\n4. Observe that the second instance fails, not binding to the port as expected. The startup sequence will continue, but eventually fail in Server.await()."}
