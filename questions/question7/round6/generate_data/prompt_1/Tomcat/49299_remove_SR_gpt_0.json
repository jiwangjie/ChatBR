{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1: Custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting", "description": "Chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf states that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual result shows that the Reload link on the page still uses the default 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name. A detailed description of the issue can be found in the attached WAR file.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie: SetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. However, the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' instead of the expected custom cookie name.", "EB": "According to the statement in 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, the expected behavior is for the Reload link to use the custom cookie name in the URL, as follows: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F.", "SR": "Please investigate the issue and ensure that the session ID is properly encoded in the URL using the configured custom cookie name, as specified in the Servlet 3.0 documentation."}
