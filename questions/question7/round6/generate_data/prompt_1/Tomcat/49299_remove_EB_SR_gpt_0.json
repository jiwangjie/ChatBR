{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Incorrect behavior regarding custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299: The documentation in Servlet 3.0 chapter 7.1.1 states that a custom cookie name should affect URL rewriting. However, the actual behavior is different. When a custom name is configured for session tracking cookies, the generated URI parameter still uses the default name 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name.", "OB": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should also be used as the name of the URI parameter when the session ID is encoded in the URL, provided that URL rewriting is enabled.", "EB": "The actual result observed is that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page incorrectly uses the default name 'jsessionid' in the URL, instead of the expected custom name.", "SR": "There is a need to correct the behavior of the 'Reload' link to properly use the custom name of the session ID in the URL, as specified in the documentation."}
