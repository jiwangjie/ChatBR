{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "When specifying <Server port='1' in server.xml, using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service works, but it prints an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The message is 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, this message is only informational and Tomcat stops successfully regardless of it. After printing the message, Catalina stopServer() calls System.exit(1) to shut down Tomcat. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "OB": "The following is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: 'SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'", "EB": "It would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in the StandardServer.await() method, so that it can be woken up by a notifyAll() call. Alternatively, the interrupt() method can be used to wake up the thread if we know its reference.", "SR": ""}
