Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start().", "EB": "Connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load().", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true. 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
