{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, it is observed that Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). This issue also affects version 7.0.0.In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is achieved by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. However, this implementation breaks the fix for BZ 48625.To reproduce the issue:1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "When calling connector.init() in StandardService.initInternal(), it is expected that the call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "EB": "Expected behavior: In StandardService.initInternal(), the connector.init() call should fail due to the inability to bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. This rethrown exception should then be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, resulting in the termination of Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true. Then, start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
