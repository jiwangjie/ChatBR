{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works but prints error message", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, Tomcat stops without any issues but prints an error message in catalina.20100427.log. The error message states 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, this message is misleading because Tomcat actually stops after printing the message. The issue may also exist with jsvc but it has not been tested. The use case for stopping Tomcat using the service launcher should be considered as well.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. The message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' is misleading because Tomcat actually stops after printing the message.", "EB": "It would be helpful to improve the error message in the log file to accurately reflect that Tomcat has actually stopped despite the message.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Shutdown the server through an OS signal by calling Catalina.stop()."}
