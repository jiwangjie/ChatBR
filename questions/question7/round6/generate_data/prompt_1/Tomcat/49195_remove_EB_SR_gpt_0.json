That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, Tomcat stops successfully but prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log: \n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down. \n\nDespite this error message, Tomcat still performs a shutdown successfully by calling the System.exit(1) method after printing the message. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "The error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' should not be printed when 1 is used as the shutdown port with the Windows service. Tomcat should stop successfully without any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml configuration file.\n2. Start the Tomcat service.\n3.
