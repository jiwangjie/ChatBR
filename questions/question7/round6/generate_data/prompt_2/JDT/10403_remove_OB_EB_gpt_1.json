  "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed",
  "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "OB": "Upon project creation, there is no confirmation or validation check to ensure that the bin directory can be successfully scrubbed (deleted and rebuilt).",
  "EB": "After creating a new project, there should be a confirmation or validation step ensuring that the bin directory can be scrubbed. This ensures that users do not encounter issues when rebuilding the output directory.",
  "SR": "1. Open the application and navigate to the project creation wizard.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure for the new project.\n3. Specify the output folder to point at a bin directory containing more than just .class files.\n4. Complete the project creation process.\n5. Observe that there is no confirmation or validation step regarding the scrubbing of the bin directory."
