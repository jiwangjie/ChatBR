  "description": "The Modify Parameters dialog is experiencing issues: duplicated name validation should be performed on the first page. Additionally, the first and second columns need to be merged.",
  "OB": "The spacing between the button and list is too large. The top button should align with the dialog's top. The table lacks a label, preventing it from containing a mnemonic. Multiple selections should be allowed as the 'move up / down' functionality can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview label wraps, but the signature preview itself doesn't have the background color set to match the hover color. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.",
  "EB": "The spacing between the button and list should be reduced. The top button should align precisely with the top of the dialog. A label should be added to the table to enable it to contain a mnemonic. Enable multiple selections to allow 'move up / down' functionality for multiple items. The signature preview label should wrap, and the background color of the signature preview should match the hover color. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview should display the entire name without getting cut off.",
  "SR": "1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog. 2. Attempt to change a parameter name to something very long. Observe the preview being cut off. 3. Check the spacing between the button and list, ensuring it's reduced. 4. Verify the alignment of the top button with the top of the dialog. 5. Check for the presence of a label in the table. 6. Attempt to select multiple items and apply 'move up / down'. Ensure it works as expected. 7. Confirm that the signature preview label wraps and the background color matches the hover color."
