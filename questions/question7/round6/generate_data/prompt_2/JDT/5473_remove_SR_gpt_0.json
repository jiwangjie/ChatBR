Then, execute ShiftLeft. The text should now move correctly. Currently, it is unclear how this behavior is specified, but it appears that in this scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be ignored). Having a stray space in the indentation can be confusing, as it prevents the text from shifting.", "EB": "In the first line of the code, replace the tab character with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually.
