{"id": "5473", "title": "ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "In Build 200110251, there is an issue with the ShiftLeft behavior when tabs and spaces are intermixed. Currently, if the first line contains a tab character and the second line contains spaces, the ShiftLeft function does not work correctly. To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following lines:\n   - Some text\n   - Some text2\n   Ensure that the first line starts with a tab character and the second line starts with spaces.\n3. Highlight the two lines and execute the ShiftLeft command.\n   Note that no text is moved.\n\nExpected Behavior: When the ShiftLeft command is executed in this scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab character). There should not be any stray spaces.\n\nThis behavior is currently confusing as it is not clear why the text does not shift. It would be helpful to address this issue and align the behavior with the expected behavior.", "OB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same. Then, execute the ShiftLeft command.",   "EB": "The expected behavior is that when executing ShiftLeft on text containing intermixed tabs and spaces, the lines should be indented consistently, following the specified indentation rules. The operation should adjust the text alignment based on the presence of tabs and spaces, ensuring the lines are uniformly indented as visually expected.", "SR": "Ensure that the ShiftLeft command correctly moves the selected text, aligning the behavior with the expected behavior in the given scenario."}
