When there are intermixed tabs and spaces in the text, the function does not work as expected. In the provided scenario, when the first line starts with a tab character and the second line starts with spaces, executing ShiftLeft does not shift the text correctly. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but it is expected that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least up to the space character (i.e., the tab should be replaced with spaces). Additionally, having a stray space in the first line makes it even more confusing as the reason for the text not shifting is not obvious.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
