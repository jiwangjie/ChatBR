{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Setting classpath/output location should be one operation", "description": "When trying to set the output location and classpath for a project, an error message is displayed that says 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. When the output location is set first, it creates an illegal state.", "OB": "After pressing 'Ok' in the project properties dialog, the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src' is displayed.", "EB": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location.", "SR": "To fix this issue, the process of setting the classpath and output location should be combined into one operation. This will ensure that creating an illegal state is avoided."}
