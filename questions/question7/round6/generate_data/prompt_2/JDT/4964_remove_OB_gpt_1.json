  "title": "Bug 4964: Code Assist Inserting Incorrect Code",
  "description": "While typing SWT code, the automatic code assist inserts the wrong suggestion. For instance, typing 'button.dispose' results in 'button.DISPOSED' being suggested, which is incorrect. This requires deletion and restarting the input. The code assist should recognize that 'dispose()' is a closer match to 'button.dispose' than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, it should consider case sensitivity when inserting suggestions automatically.",
  "OB": "While typing 'button.dispose', the code assist suggests 'button.DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()', requiring manual deletion of the incorrect suggestion.",
  "EB": "The code assist should accurately suggest 'dispose()' when typing 'button.dispose', improving its accuracy and preventing incorrect suggestions like 'button.DISPOSED'.",
  "SR": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, type 'button.dispose' to observe the code assist suggesting 'button.DISPOSED' incorrectly."
