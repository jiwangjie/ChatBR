{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "The current project creation process does not confirm if the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "When creating a new project for an existing directory structure, the system should prompt the user to confirm that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt if it already exists.", "SR": "Add a confirmation step during project creation to ensure the user is aware that the output directory will be scrubbed and rebuilt if it already exists."}
