  "title": "Bug 9619: Issue with Move static member in Dialog details",
  "description": "When performing 'Move static member' in Dialog details (version 20020212a), several issues are observed:\n- Mnemonics are missing.\n- Validation is absent on the type field. The existence of the type should be checked, similar to how it's done in the type wizard for the superclass. This validation is not too resource-intensive and should be implemented.\n- The label should read 'Select destination type:' for clarity.\n- The browse button appears smaller than standard sizes, it should use SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\n- The title displays long text, causing a 'Type not found' message when moving to the next page. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be visible in the dialog.\n- When the destination type matches the source type during refactoring, a warning erroneously states that it will result in errors. This warning leads to pseudo-changes in all referencing classes, which is incorrect.",
  "OB": "1. Mnemonics are missing.\n2. Validation on the type field is absent, causing issues when moving to the next page.\n3. Label does not read 'Select destination type:'.\n4. Browse button size is smaller than standard sizes.\n5. Long text in title causing 'Type not found' message.\n6. All types, not just from source folders of the own project, are visible in the dialog.\n7. Warning during refactoring about destination type matching the source type causing pseudo-changes in referencing classes.",

Label should be changed to 'Select destination type:' for clarity.\n4. The browse button should use SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\n5. The title should be truncated or adjusted to prevent the 'Type not found' message.\n6. Restrict visibility of types in the dialog to only those from the source folders of the own project.\n7. Refactoring should not trigger warnings and pseudo-changes when the destination type matches the source type.",
  "SR": "1. Launch the 'Move static member' function in Dialog details.\n2. Observe the absence of mnemonics.\n3. Navigate to the type field and attempt to proceed to the next page.\n4. Check the label displayed for the destination type.\n5. Examine the size of the browse button.\n6. Input long text into the title and proceed to the next page to trigger the 'Type not found' message.\n7. Perform refactoring with a destination type that matches the source type to observe the warning and pseudo-changes in referencing classes."
