The progress dialog closes immediately and eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request. This behavior should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. When calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, the 'cancellable' parameter should be set to false.", "OB": "1) Open the debug perspective.\n2) Go to the breakpoints pane.\n3) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception breakpoint.\n4) In the progress dialog, click cancel.", "EB": "The progress dialog should close immediately when the cancel button is clicked and the exception list should not be displayed.
