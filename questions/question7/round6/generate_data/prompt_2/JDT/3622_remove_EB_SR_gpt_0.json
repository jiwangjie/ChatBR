When invoking the New Java Package wizard, before typing anything, a message appears at the top stating - 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. However, at this point, the package name field is empty. The user is unsure of what this message means and if it is an error. Notes from the conversation:\nEG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM) - There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and Finish should be disabled.\nMA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM) - It is a warning. I will remove the message.\nEG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM) - Issue: How to create a default package? It can't be created by the user since it is always there.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' even when the package name field is empty.
