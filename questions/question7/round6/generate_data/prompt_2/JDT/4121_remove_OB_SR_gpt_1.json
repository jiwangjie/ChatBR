  "description": "When using the JarExporter, it results in an out-of-sync state.",
  "OB": "The JarExporter includes the exported JAR file within itself, causing an out-of-sync issue.",
  "EB": "The exported JAR file should exclude itself to prevent out-of-sync problems.",
  "SR": "1. Open JarExporter tool.\n2. Select 'Export'.\n3. Check the exported JAR contents; observe it contains a duplicate of itself.\n4. This duplication leads to the out-of-sync state."
