{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "When accessing the All types dialog in JDK 1.4, it shows obfuscated classes such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd'. This makes it difficult to identify the desired classes.", "OB": "The All types dialog displays obfuscated class names.", "EB": "The All types dialog should not display obfuscated class names.", "SR": "To address this issue, I suggest either sorting the lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter or completely filtering out the obfuscated classes from the All types dialog."}
