{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "While writing SWT code, I typed 'button.dispose'. I did not realize that the code assist list was up because I was not looking. There were 2 items in the list: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. I then accidentally typed '(' which caused the code assist to insert whatever was selected, resulting in 'button.DISPOSED'. This is not what I intended, and I had to delete it all and start again. The code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' much better than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, the code assist should be case sensitive when automatically inserting.
