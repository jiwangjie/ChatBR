{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - CodeCompletion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature eats too much code. Consider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the `baz` call in `bar` to make the program correct. Steps to reproduce the issue: 1. Place the cursor after the first `x.` in the `baz` call. 2. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist. 3. Type `f` to filter the list. 4. Select `foo()`. The code is changed to: `baz(x.x.foo())`. I would expect the code assist to give me `baz(x.foo()x.foo())`.", "OB": "The code assist feature should give the expected result by providing `baz(x.foo()x.foo())` instead of `baz(x.x.foo())`.", "EB": "The code assist feature currently gives `baz(x.x.foo())`. It should be changed to `baz(x.foo()x.foo())`.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Change the baz call to `baz(x.x.foo())`. 2. Place the cursor after the first `x.` in the `baz` call. 3.
