The buttons in the dialog are too small, which makes them difficult to click.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\ng. The dialog comes up as too large for methods with many parameters.\n\n", "OB": "a.
