{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "Currently, the setting of classpath and output location is done as separate operations. It would be more convenient if these two settings could be done in a single operation. Additionally, the error message displayed when a nested path is provided for the output location is unclear and should be improved.", "OB": "The setting of classpath and output location as separate operations.", "EB": "The setting of classpath and output location should be offered as a single operation. The error message when a nested path is provided for the output location should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "Combine the setting of classpath and output location into a single operation. Improve the error message for nested output location paths."}
