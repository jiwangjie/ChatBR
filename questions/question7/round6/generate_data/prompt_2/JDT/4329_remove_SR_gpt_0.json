{"id": "4329", "title": "No search results when searching via Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X)", "description": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X), no results are returned. The search dialog is initialized with the fully qualified name, which is not found when searching for declarations. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly. The expected behavior is that the search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "The search dialog in the Package view should use the element name instead of the fully qualified name when searching for declarations.", "EB": "The search dialog in the Package view incorrectly uses the fully qualified name when searching for declarations.", "SR": "Update the search dialog in the Package view to use the element name instead of the fully qualified name when searching for declarations."}
