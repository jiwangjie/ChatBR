After executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the space character (i.e., removing the tab character). It is currently confusing as there might be unexpected behavior if there is a stray space preventing the text from shifting.", "SR": "Ensure that ShiftLeft properly aligns the text when there are intermixed tabs and spaces, removing any stray spaces and aligning the text correctly as per the given constraints."}
