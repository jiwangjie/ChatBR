The ajc documentation suggests that the outjar option should create a zip file, but it is not clear how to include a valid MANIFEST.MF file in the output.", "OB": "When calling ajc with the sourceroots option and the outjar option to specify the output .jar file, the resulting .jar file is missing a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The ajc compiler should include a MANIFEST.MF file in the generated .jar file when using the outjar option.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar' and observe that the generated .jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
