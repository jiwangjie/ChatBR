This issue occurs even when there is a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file present in the source directory.", "OB": "I expect the ajc command to create a JAR file that includes the MANIFEST.MF file from the source directory.", "EB": "The ajc command currently creates a JAR file without including the MANIFEST.MF file, resulting in an invalid JAR file.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, please modify the ajc command to include the MANIFEST.MF file from the source directory when creating the JAR file."}
