However, this file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc suggests that the outjar parameter should put the output classes in a zip file, but it does not seem to be functioning correctly in this case.", "OB": "The output file created by ajc with the outjar parameter does not contain a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The outjar parameter should create a valid jar file that includes a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "ajc should create a valid jar file with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file when using the outjar parameter."}
