I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n\n```\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Compile using the following command: `ajc subpackage\\Test.java`\n\n3. You will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nWhen compared to the behavior of javac, this issue is not a big deal, really.", "OB": "No OB statement provided.", "EB": "It will be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "SR": "Add the -d option to ajc when compiling classes from a subpackage to ensure the directories are created correctly."}
