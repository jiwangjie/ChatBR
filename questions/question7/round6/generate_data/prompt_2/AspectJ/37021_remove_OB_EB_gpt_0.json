{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path listed incorrectly in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When declaring warnings on binary files [java|aj], the source path is listed incorrectly as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'. Please refer to the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ for reproducing the problem. It should be noted that these tests may produce false positives as filename checking is not enabled during harness verification of messages. It appears that AJDT may omit the filename if it is nonsensical to AJDT.", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "Update the source path in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars to use 'app/Main.class' format instead of 'app.Main.class'."}
