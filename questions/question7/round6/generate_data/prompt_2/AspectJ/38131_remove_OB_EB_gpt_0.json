{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131 - ajc should include the option while compiling classes from subpackage correctly", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I suspect it may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. To reproduce the issue, create a class in a subpackage, like this:\n\n```java\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThen compile using the following command:\n\n```\najc subpackage\\Test.java\n```\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. The same command with javac, `javac subpackage\\Test.java`, does not have this issue. It's not a major problem, but it's an unexpected behavior.", "OB": "ajc does not include the appropriate option while compiling classes from a subpackage", "EB": "ajc should include the appropriate option `-d .` while compiling classes from a subpackage", "SR": "Modify ajc to correctly process classes from subpackage by including the `-d .` option in the compilation process"}
