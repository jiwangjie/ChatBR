{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d . option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n\najc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. This means running the java command results in the exception \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\".\n\nRunning the following command fixes the problem: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java.", "OB": "The test.class file is then put in the subpackage\\subpackage directory.", "EB": "It would be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "SR": ""}
