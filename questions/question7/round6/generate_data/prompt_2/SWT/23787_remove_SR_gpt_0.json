The current integration build 09/17 shows that it looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, these text fields all get automatic borders, which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out much worse.", "EB": "To address this issue, the text fields should be created as readonly Text fields instead of Labels. This will prevent them from appearing as user input targets. It is possible that the current implementation uses text fields so that their values can be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": ""}
