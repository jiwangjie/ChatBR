{"id": "17993", "title": "Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace dialog is to replace what is typed in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields with a value from the history if a match is found. This behavior is similar to autocomplete found in browsers. However, it would be better if what is typed is not replaced with a value from the history. Providing a full autocomplete feature in the future might be a viable solution.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog, accessed through 'Edit > Find/Replace...', has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search and replaces what was typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what was typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The Find/Replace dialog should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by choosing 'Edit > Find/Replace...' 2. Type 'a' into the Find field. 3. Click 'Find'. 4. Try to type 'A' into the Find field. The typed entry should not be replaced with the value from the history."}
