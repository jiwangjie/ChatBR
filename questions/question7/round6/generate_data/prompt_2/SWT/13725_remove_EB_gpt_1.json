However, if I repeat steps 1 and 2, and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.",

Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3. On my fast machine at home, it takes about 8 seconds to perform the following steps:\n   - Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n   - Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n   - Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n4. Repeat steps 1 and 2, then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor. Observe that it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original."
