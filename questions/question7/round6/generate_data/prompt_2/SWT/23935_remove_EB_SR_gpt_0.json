{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both the tree and text widgets are children of the shell. The issue occurs only on Windows. A possible workaround is to create the text editor as a sibling of the tree and move it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree receives focus. On Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. This is because the text widget is a child of the tree. As a result, platform UI bug 2470 occurs.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
