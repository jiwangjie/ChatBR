{"id": "13725", "title": "Bug 13725 - Revert is much slower than close and reopen in java editor", "description": "When working in the Java editor, the 'Revert' operation is significantly slower compared to the 'Close' and 'Reopen' operations. On my fast machine at home, it takes 8 seconds to perform the following steps: 1) Open an editor on the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. 2) Select the end of the first line and add a space to mark the file as dirty. Then, 3) Click on the close box in the editor tab, 4) Answer 'no' to the 'Do you want to save changes' dialog, and 5) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. However, if I repeat steps 1) and 2) and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original content.", "OB": "1) Open an editor on the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.2) Select the end of the first line and add a space to mark the file as dirty.3) Click on the close box in the editor tab.4) Answer 'no' to the 'Do you want to save changes' dialog.5) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.", "EB": "After selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original content.", "SR": "Investigate and optimize the performance of the 'Revert' operation in the Java editor to improve its speed."}
