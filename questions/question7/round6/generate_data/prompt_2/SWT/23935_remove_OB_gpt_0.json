We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "On Windows, when clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree does not lose focus.", "EB": "When running build 20020920, the attached code shows that the left tree and text behave as expected on Windows and Linux.", "SR": "Clicking anywhere in the tree should not cause it to gain focus."}
