On motif, these text fields have automatic borders that make them appear as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out even worse.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. On Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page on motif platforms should not use text fields. The appearance of the text fields should be consistent across all platforms.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Select a Project\n2. Right-click and choose Properties\n3. Navigate to the Info page\n\nExpected behavior: The readonly fields (such as Path, Type) should not be displayed as text fields."}
