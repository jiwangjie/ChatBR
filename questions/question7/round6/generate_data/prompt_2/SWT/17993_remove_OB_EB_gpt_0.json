{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace field replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace field is replacing user-typed entries with values from the search history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. However, it would be better if the Find/Replace field does not replace the user's typed entry with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered.", "OB": "When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the application searches for entries from previous searches and replaces the user's typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "When typing in the Find or Replace With fields, the application should not automatically replace the user's typed entry with a value from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Choose Edit > Find/Replace...\n2. Type 'a' into the Find field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the Find field. Notice that the typed character is automatically replaced with a value from the search history."}
