Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it is recommended to make the constructor private. This will prevent people from instantiating the class when there is no need to do so. Adding a private constructor does not increase the size because the compiler provides a free public constructor by default.", "SR": "Replace the line above with: 'static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);'. While I haven't tested it, this change should provide the same functionality."}
