{"id": "14047", "title": "Bug 14047 - StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap", "description": "When changing the text in StyledText with word wrap enabled, the widget performs multiple unnecessary redraws. This can impact performance and result in an inefficient user experience.", "OB": "Currently, the widget performs multiple redraws during a text change with word wrap. This can result in unnecessary rendering and impact the overall performance of the application.", "EB": "The widget should only perform one redraw for each visible line during a text change with word wrap enabled. This will ensure a more efficient rendering process.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, run the following test case: \n1. Enable word wrap in StyledText.\n2. Make a text change that triggers a redraw.\n3. Observe the number of redraws occurring during the text change.\nTo address this issue, add the following line to the performPaint method in StyledText: \nSystem.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight); This will print the relevant information about the redraws occurring during the text change."}
