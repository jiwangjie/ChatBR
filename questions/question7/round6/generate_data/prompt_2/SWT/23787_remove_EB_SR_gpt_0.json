{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787[Properties dialog] Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog shows text fields with automatic borders, giving the appearance of user input targets. On Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields also have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more. This issue is observed in the integration build of 09/17. The appearance of the text fields should be improved to provide a more consistent and visually appealing experience.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets. On Solaris/AIX/HPUX, the fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog on motif platforms should not use text fields. Instead, a different UI component should be used to display the information.", "SR": "1. Remove the automatic borders around the text fields on motif platforms.\n2. Adjust the background colors of the text fields on Solaris/AIX/HPUX to match the surrounding UI elements.\n3. Consider using a different UI component, such as labels or static text, to display the information on the Project Properties Info page to improve the visual consistency and avoid confusion with user input targets."}
