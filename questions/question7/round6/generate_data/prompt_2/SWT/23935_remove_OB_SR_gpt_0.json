{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the attached code using build 20020920, the left tree and text behave as expected on Windows and Linux.", "EB": "However, when running the attached code using build 20020920, the right tree and text do not behave as expected on Windows.", "SR": "To fix this bug, we can try creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree so it works consistently on both Windows and Linux."}
