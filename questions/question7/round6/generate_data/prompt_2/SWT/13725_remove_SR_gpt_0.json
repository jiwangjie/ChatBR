Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:", "OB": "1. Answer \"no\" to the \"do you want to save changes\" dialog.\n2. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.\n4. Select \"Revert\" from the pop-up menu in the editor.", "EB": "This behaviour seems odd because the process of reverting the file contents should not take longer than simply closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "Investigate the code responsible for the \"Revert\" functionality in the java editor to identify and resolve the performance issue."}
