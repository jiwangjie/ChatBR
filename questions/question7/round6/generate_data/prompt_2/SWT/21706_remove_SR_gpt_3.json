  "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage",
  "description": "The current issue is with the usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class in win32.",
  "OB": "When attempting to use the method in question, a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown. This error is not defined in the CLDC class libraries, causing complications in the CLDC version of SWT.",
  "EB": "To resolve this issue, add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no non-static methods in the class, making the constructor private would be beneficial. This change would prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class, and it won't add any size because the compiler provides a free public constructor by default.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Navigate to the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class on the win32 platform.\n2. Identify the line containing 'static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);'.\n3. Observe the occurrence of NoClassDefFoundError when using jxeLink or similar verification methods.\n4. To confirm, utilize the Eclipse or Sun's compiler without encountering any compilation errors, yet encountering issues in the CLDC version of SWT due to the absence of NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC class libraries."
