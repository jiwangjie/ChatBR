{"id": "21834", "title": "Coolbar deleting items corrupting layout", "description": "The Coolbar in build 2002071610021 has a bug where deleting items corrupts the layout. When pressing the Delete button, the first item on the second row is deleted. However, instead of remaining in the second row, the Launch item is moved to the first row. This behavior is incorrect.", "OB": "Press the Delete button and delete the first item on the second row. Notice that the second row is removed when the delete occurs, but it should remain.", "EB": "Press the Delete button and delete the first item on the second row. Notice that the Launch item is moved to the first row when the delete occurs, but it should stay on the second row.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n\n1. Run the attached test case.\n2. Drag the Open Type coolitem to the second row (last coolItem).\n3. Drag the Launch coolitem (last coolItem on first row) to the second row, putting it after the Open Type item.\n4. Drag the Search coolitem to the second row, putting it after the Launch coolitem.\n5. Drag the Script coolitem to the second row (last coolItem on first row), putting it after the Search coolitem.\n6. Press the Delete button and delete the first item on the second row. Notice that the second row is removed when the delete occurs, but it should remain."}
