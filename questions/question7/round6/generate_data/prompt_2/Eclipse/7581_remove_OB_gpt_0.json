As a result, the drop-down button may be clipped and not visible on the screen.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should automatically adjust its width to match the width of the property sheet column, so that the drop-down button is always visible.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor is currently not resizing itself correctly in the property sheet, causing the drop-down button to be clipped when the strings are wider than the column. This issue needs to be investigated to determine if it is a problem with our implementation or with SWT.", "SR": "In the PropertySheetViewer, objects can be edited using a set of rows that are name-value pairs displayed in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor, which has a method to create a cell editor. When creating editors that include a ComboBoxCellEditor, I provide a constructor argument with a set of strings. The ComboBoxCellEditor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the drop-down button is positioned at the right edge of the column. The problem occurs when any of the strings in the drop-down list is wider than the width of the property sheet column. In this case, the combo box grows to match the width of the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be clipped if it extends beyond the visible area of the property sheet. To ensure a good user experience, the ComboBoxCellEditor should resize itself to fit within the visible area of the property sheet, with the drop-down button always visible."}
