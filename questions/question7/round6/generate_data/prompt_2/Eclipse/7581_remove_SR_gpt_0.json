The width of the combo box is not equal to the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior to be that the combo box is always the same width as the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. We will need to investigate to determine whether this is an issue with our implementation or with SWT.", "SR": ""}
