Currently, when trying to open a file in another editor while it is already opened in one, there is no warning or error message displayed.", "OB": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Close the file that is currently opened in the editor.\n2. Go to the Java Perspective.\n3. Open a Java file by simply double clicking on it.\n4. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n5. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' followed by 'System Editor'.\n6. Nothing happens.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe workbench should display a warning message stating that opening the file in another editor may result in overwriting changes made in the current editor. The user should then be prompted to confirm whether they want to proceed or not.\n\nExplanation:\nWe believe it is a safety feature in WSAD that prevents external editing while a file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning message displayed in the workbench when attempting to open a file in another editor while it is already opened in one.", "SR": ""}
