{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.", "OB": "The system should provide a 'Do you want to save your file' dialog box with options Yes, No, and Cancel, which halts the shutdown process.", "EB": "The system currently does not provide a warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty file(s) before shutting down the computer. The shutdown/reboot process is immediate without any prompt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n3. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer.\n\nResults: There is no warning or question message box displayed, and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately without giving the user a chance to save their dirty file."}
