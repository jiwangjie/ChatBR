A dialog will appear.\n4) Browse for a valid container location.\n5) Type the filename, but do not include the extension (as it is not requested).\n6) Click Ok.\n\nObserve that the Navigator has added the file in the specified location, but without showing the file extension.", "EB": "The saved file appears as a generic file and is opened as text instead of retaining the original extension. The file should be saved with the same extension as the original, unless explicitly changed.", "SR": "When using SaveAs, the saved file should retain the original extension by default, instead of appearing as a generic file with no extension. Please update the SaveAs functionality to preserve the file type."}
