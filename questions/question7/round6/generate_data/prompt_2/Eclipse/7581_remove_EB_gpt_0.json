", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the PropertySheetViewer does not size correctly in the property sheet. When using ComboBoxCellEditor, which can include strings, in column two of the property sheet, the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column. However, if any of the strings is wider than the column width, the combo box expands to accommodate the widest item. This causes the drop-down button to be pushed off the visible area of the property sheet, making it inaccessible without widening the property sheet view.", "EB": "", "SR": "The issue can be resolved by ensuring that the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet is sized appropriately to accommodate the widest item while also ensuring that the drop-down button remains within the visible area of the property sheet."}
