{"id": "12906", "title": "Bug 12906[Editor Mgmt] Cannot open a file in multiple editors simultaneously", "description": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open the same file in another editor does not show any warning or error message. This behavior should be changed to display a warning message or error message to inform the user that the file is already opened in another editor.", "OB": "When a file is opened in one editor, it can also be opened in another editor without any warning or error message.", "EB": "When a file is opened in one editor, attempting to open the same file in another editor should display a warning message or error message indicating that the file is already opened in another editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  \n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double-click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.  \n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on a Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will open with the java file displayed. Close this window.  \n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file will now be opened in the workbench.  \n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.  \nExpected Results:  \nA warning message should be displayed in the workbench, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, instructing the user to close all instances of the file first.  \nWe believe this behavior is a safety feature where WSAD doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."}
