Currently, the files do not appear in the File menu MRU list. The expected behavior is for these files to be persisted between sessions. The implementation should use the IPersistableElement and not peek into the underlying resource. It's important to note that the IEditorInput may not be a resource.", "OB": "The MRU file list is not being persisted between sessions. Files do not appear in the File menu MRU list.", "EB": "The MRU file list should be persisted between sessions, ensuring that files appear in the File menu MRU list.", "SR": "Implement the use of IPersistableElement to persist the MRU file list between sessions. Avoid peeking into the underlying resource and consider that the IEditorInput may not be a resource."}
