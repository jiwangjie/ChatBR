  "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings",
  "description": "When a WSWB (Example Software) session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.",
  "OB": "When shutting down Windows with an open WSWB session containing a modified .txt file, there is no warning or question message box to prompt users to save their changes. The computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.",
  "EB": "When shutting down Windows with an open WSWB session containing a modified .txt file, a warning or question message box should appear, allowing users to save their changes before the computer is shut down/rebooted.",
  "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu, select the 'Shut Down' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nResults: There should be a warning or question message box giving users a chance to save their dirty model(s) before the computer is shut down/rebooted. This behavior is expected in line with other Windows programs (e.g., Word, Outlook, etc.)."
