Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. Next, left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down\u2026' command to shutdown/reboot the computer. The result is that there is no warning or question message box, and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. This behavior is different from other Windows programs like Word or Outlook."}
