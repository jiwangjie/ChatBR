When attempting to export, an error message box appears indicating problems during the export process, specifically highlighting the file with the same name in project2 as the issue.", "EB": "The export process should successfully create a zip file containing all the selected projects, even if they have files with the same name under different directories.", "SR": "To fix this bug, the export functionality should handle files with the same name under different directories correctly and ensure they are included in the resulting zip file without any errors or omissions."}
