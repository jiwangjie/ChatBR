", "EB": "The UI should provide a preference setting to define the line delimiter for new files. The options for line delimiters should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure consistency across all plugins' usage of line delimiters for new files.", "SR": ""}
