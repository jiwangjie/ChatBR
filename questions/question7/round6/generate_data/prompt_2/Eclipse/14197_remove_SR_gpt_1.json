  "EB": "At the moment of deletion, the package view in the background immediately refilters. In my opinion, refiltering should only occur when closing the working set selection dialog, not during manipulation. Additionally, I believe that pressing cancel should revert all changes made to working sets, including canceling the removal.",
  "SR": "1. Create a working set with one project and select it. Ensure that the package view is filtered.\n2. Attempt to remove the working set.\n3. Observe the immediate refiltering of the package view. This behavior is unexpected and should only occur upon closing the working set selection dialog.\n4. Press cancel and check if all changes made to the working set, including the removal, are successfully canceled."
