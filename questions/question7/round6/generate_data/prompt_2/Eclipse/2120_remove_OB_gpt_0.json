{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120 - MRU File List is not persisted between sessions (1GE71Z0)", "description": "The MRU (Most Recently Used) file list in the File menu is not being persisted between sessions. As a result, when the workbench is restarted, the previously opened files do not appear in the MRU list. According to the notes, the MRU list should be persisted using the IPersistableElement, without peeking into the implementation or relying on the underlying resource being a resource. ", "OB": "The files should be persisted in the MRU list between sessions.", "EB": "Currently, the files are not appearing in the MRU list when the workbench is restarted.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start the workbench.\n2. Open 2 or 3 files.\n3. Shutdown the workbench.\n4. Restart the workbench."}
