Launch WSWB and create two projects. 2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as \"foo.txt\"). 3. From the main menu, select File > Export and select Zip File to export.", "OB": "The zip file is unable to store files with the same name under different directories.", "EB": "When exporting multiple files with the same name but under different directories to a zip file, the files are not properly stored in the zip file. Instead, only one version of the file is included in the zip file, causing the loss of other versions.", "SR": "Modify the export functionality so that the zip file is able to store multiple files with the same name under different directories. Each version of the file should be included in the zip file without overwriting or causing loss of other versions."}
