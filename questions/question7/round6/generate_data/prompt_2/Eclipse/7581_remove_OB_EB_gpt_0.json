{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor not sizing correctly in Property Sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows users to edit objects using a set of rows that consist of name-value pairs in two columns, each defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include the ComboBoxCellEditor. The ComboBoxCellEditor can be given a list of strings. The editor is displayed in column two of the property sheet, and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column.\n\nA problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It seems that the combo box automatically expands to the width of the widest item. The problem with this is that the drop-down button may now be too far to the right and outside the visible area of the property sheet, thus getting clipped. From a user's perspective, they can no longer see the drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button becomes visible. ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size itself to fit within the width of the property sheet column, regardless of the width of the widest item. The drop-down button should always be fully visible within the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor has been fixed to properly size itself based on the width of the property sheet column. The drop-down button now appears within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the widest item in the combo box.", "SR": "To resolve this issue, ensure that the ComboBoxCellEditor is modified to size itself appropriately within the property sheet column. The drop-down button should always be visible within the property sheet view, regardless of the width of the widest item in the combo box."}
