The file remains open in the original editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a new basic project\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml'\n3. When the editor used is the scripted resource editor example, select 'test.xml' in the Navigator\n4. Choose 'Open With...' -> 'Default Text Editor'\nExpected result: The file 'test.xml' should be opened in a new editor, as the editor type is different.\nActual result: Nothing happens, and the scripted resource editor example remains active. \n\nNOTES: Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types."}
