{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "When resizing the view to a smaller size, the close button and label no longer stay on the same line. This can pose a usability problem as users expect the close button to be on the same line as the label, located to the far right corner.", "OB": "Previously, the close button and label always stayed on the same line, regardless of the size of the view.", "EB": "Now, when resizing the view to a smaller size, the close button and label no longer stay on the same line.", "SR": "On Linux, running build 20011127 (not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000), when resizing a view like the Navigator to a smaller size, the tool items move below the label."}
