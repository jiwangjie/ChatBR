Start WSWB and create a new project\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer\n\nResults: There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook etc.)", "OB": "A 'Do you want to save your file' dialog box should be provided, with options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' (which halts the shutdown).", "EB": "", "SR": "One other nice feature might be to allow the applications to control the shutdown/save also or to pop up their own windows that would also (if 'Cancel' is selected) allow the user to stop the shutdown."}
