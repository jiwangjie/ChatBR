That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured, server not shut down.'. However, Tomcat stops despite this message. It is worth noting that after printing the message, the method Catalina.stopServer() executes System.exit(1), resulting in Tomcat shutdown. Additionally, it seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this bug: \n\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Shut down the server through the OS signal, for example, by calling Catalina.stop()."}
