{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name in URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of the servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual result is that the page sends a cookie with a different name and the URL's session id parameter still uses the default name 'jsessionid'.", "OB": "1. Open the attached 'cookiename.war' file.\n2. Configure a custom name for the session tracking cookie.\n3. Enable URL rewriting.\n4. Access the web application.\n5. Observe the session tracking cookie's name and the session id parameter in the URL.", "EB": "", "SR": "When a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies and URL rewriting is enabled, the custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter in the URL. Currently, the implementation does not reflect this behavior. Please correct the behavior so that the custom name is used for the session id parameter in the URL when URL rewriting is enabled."}
