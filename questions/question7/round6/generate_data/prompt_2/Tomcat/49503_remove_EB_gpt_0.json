{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this bug affects version 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, which allows Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() methods [1]. However, in the current implementation, this breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully. 2. Start a second instance with the same configuration. Expected behavior: The second instance fails to start because it cannot bind to the port. Actual behavior: The second instance starts successfully because the connector does not try to bind to the port until start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true", "EB": "The Connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), not just in start(). This ensures that multiple instances of Tomcat cannot bind to the same port.", "SR": "When starting two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time, the second instance should fail to start because it cannot bind to the port."}
