  "title": "Using '1' as Shutdown Port with Windows Service Results in Error Message",
  "description": "When configuring the server.xml3 file with <Server port=\"1\", there are two distinct use cases. However, improvements in the shutdown process for Tomcat could enhance its functionality. The use of System.exit(0) appears to function irrespective of these cases. It's plausible that jsvc might exhibit similar behavior, though it remains untested.",
  "OB": "When setting the shutdown port as '1' with a Windows service, Tomcat operates but generates an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error reads: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServerSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Despite this message, Tomcat still shuts down. After displaying the message, the Catalina stopServer() function executes System.exit(1), leading to the shutdown of Tomcat. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that setting the shutdown port as '1' should not generate an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The shutdown process should function smoothly without displaying any errors, ensuring a clean and complete shutdown of Tomcat when using '1' as the shutdown port.",
  "SR": "1. Modify the server.xml3 file to include <Server port=\"1\".\n2. Run Tomcat as a Windows service.\n3. Observe the catalina.20100427.log file for error messages related to the shutdown process."
