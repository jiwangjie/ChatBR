{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() methods [1]. This issue breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.

The second instance fails, but not in the expected way.", "SR": "The connector does not attempt to bind to the port, causing the exception to not occur. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await()."}
