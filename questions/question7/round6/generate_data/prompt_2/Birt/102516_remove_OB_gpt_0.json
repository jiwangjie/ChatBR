{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. However, currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and you have to wait for it to load. This can be time-consuming, especially if there are a large number of tables and columns. The system eventually displays a message saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on the schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. After waiting for some time, a message is displayed saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "The data set editor should load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema when the editor is opened. This will improve performance and prevent the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' from appearing.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the data set editor. 2. Wait for the Editor to query the entire schema and load the tables and columns. 3. Notice the appearance of the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. To reproduce the expected behavior: 1. Open the data set editor. 2. Immediately see the tables and columns list, without having to wait for the entire schema to be queried."}
