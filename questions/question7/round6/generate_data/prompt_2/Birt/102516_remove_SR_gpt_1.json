The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. When using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, even after applying the schema filter, a warning message is still displayed on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The loading of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
