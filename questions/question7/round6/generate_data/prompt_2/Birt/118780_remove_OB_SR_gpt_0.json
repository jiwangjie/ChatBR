{"id": "118780", "title": "Setting alias for columns in data set does not update the column names in the expression builder", "description": "", "OB": "When selecting a dataset in the expression builder, the original column names are displayed instead of the alias names that have been set for the columns.", "EB": "According to SCR 78193, the alias names should be used in the expression builder for the columns in the dataset. Therefore, when double-clicking on the first column name, it should display the alias name (row[\"column1\"]) instead of the original name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the expression builder. 2. Select a dataset that has columns with alias names set. 3. Double-click on the first column name. Observe that the original name is displayed instead of the alias name."}
