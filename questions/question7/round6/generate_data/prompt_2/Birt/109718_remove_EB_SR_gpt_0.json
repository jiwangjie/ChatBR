Property group information should be provided on the ElementDefn class.\n2. Completion of the TODO tasks.\n3. Review of the result.\n4. Enhancement of the message file to avoid duplicate error messages.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further information.", "OB": "When I put a large content in a text item, the tips that are supposed to show the content in a formatted manner are instead showing the content in one line.
