{"id": "108822", "title": "More logical processing needed for disk sorting when there is a boundary value for the row value", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk with 40000 rows, and the program is set to process only data less than 40000 rows, the following operations occur: 1. The file is saved as a temporary file. 2. The file is loaded into memory. 3. The data is sorted. 4. The sorted data is saved to a temporary file.", "EB": "When sorting data on disk with a boundary value for the row value, the program should handle the sorting logic properly. Specifically, it should not save the file as a temporary file, load it into memory, and then sort the data. Instead, it should directly sort the data on disk, without the need for temporary files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort data on disk with a boundary value for the row value. 2. Observe if the program saves the file as a temporary file, loads it into memory, and then sorts the data. Note that the expected behavior is for the program to directly sort the data on disk without the use of temporary files."}
