{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic needed for disk sorting when there are border values in the row data", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for sorting data on disk is not efficient when there are border values in the row data. It performs the following operations:\n1. Saves the file as a temp file\n2. Loads the file into memory\n3. Sorts the data\n4. Saves the sorted data to a temp file\n\nHowever, this logic is not optimal and can be improved.", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected for disk sorting. Instead of saving the file as a temp file, the data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file. This will improve the sorting process for data with border values in the rows.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk\n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000 rows\n3. Observe the current sorting process:\n   a. Save the file as a temp file\n   b. Load the file into memory\n   c. Sort the data\n   d. Save the sorted data to the temp file\n\nExpected result: The data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file, without the need for a temp file."}
