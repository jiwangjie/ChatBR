{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not persisting filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This could lead to a lot of trouble when using XPath expressions in this way.", "OB": "When I enter an XPath expression with a selection part in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, such as section[@id='left'], and save the changes, the filter information is not persisted and is lost.", "EB": "The filter information should be persisted in the .rptdesign file when leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'], in the column mapping.\n3. Save the changes and close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog and verify that the filter information is still visible."}
