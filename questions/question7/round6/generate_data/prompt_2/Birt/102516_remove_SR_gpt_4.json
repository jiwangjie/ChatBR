{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Although there is a schema filter in place, a warning message still appears on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor displays every schema on the system, which results in several hundred tables being shown. Even with the schema filter, I still encounter a warning message when loading the page because the tree is populated on load.", "EB": "To improve performance and prevent the warning message, the load of the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
