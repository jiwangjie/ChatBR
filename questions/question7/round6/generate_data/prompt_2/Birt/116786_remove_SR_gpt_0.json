{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "The current issue is that the report design is storing an absolute path for the included library instead of a relative path. This creates a problem when the report design is moved or deployed to different environments.", "OB": "When I examine the report design, I observe that the <property name='fileName'/> element contains an absolute path - 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the BIRT designer should generate and save a relative path for the included library. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, the relative path should be saved as '$project/test/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the BIRT designer\n2. Create or open a report design\n3. Include a library in the report design\n4. Save the report design\n5. Check the <property name='fileName'/> element to see if it contains a relative path"}
