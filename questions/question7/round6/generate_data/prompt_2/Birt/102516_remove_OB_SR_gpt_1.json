{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, the entire tree is loaded when the page loads, which can slow down the performance, especially when dealing with large data sources. It would be more efficient to load the tables and columns on demand, i.e. only when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "Currently, the tree control loads all tables and columns in the data source when the JDBC Data Set Editor page is loaded, regardless of whether the user actually interacts with the tree control.", "EB": "The tree control should only load tables and columns in the data source when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the tree control loads all tables and columns in the data source.\n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter.\n4. Observe that the tree control only loads the necessary tables and columns based on the user's interaction."}
