On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Currently, even with the schema filter, a warning message is displayed on load because the tree is being populated on load. It is suggested that the load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query displays every schema (aka catalog) on the system.
