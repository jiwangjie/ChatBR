{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return some user recognizable strings", "description": "When extracting data, the function 'getcolumnlabel' is not returning user recognizable strings in the meta data object.", "OB": "Currently, when the 'getcolumnlabel' function is called before extraction, it does not return any recognizable labels.", "EB": "The 'getcolumnlabel' function should return the same user recognizable labels both before and after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Call the 'getcolumnlabel' function before extracting data.\n2. Compare the labels returned with the expected user recognizable labels.\n3. Extract the data and call the 'getcolumnlabel' function again.\n4. Compare the labels returned with the expected user recognizable labels again.\n5. Note the difference in labels between the pre-extraction and post-extraction calls to the 'getcolumnlabel' function."}
