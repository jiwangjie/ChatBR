{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. However, when using the code from CVS as of 6/30/05, although there is a schema filter, the tree is still being populated on load, resulting in a warning message.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control populates all schemas and tables on load, which can be a few hundred tables. This is not ideal as it causes a warning message to appear.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control should only load schemas and tables on demand, preventing the warning message from appearing on load.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers.\n2. Check if the tree control is populating all schemas and tables on load.\n3. Confirm if a warning message is shown when the tree is being populated.\n4. Verify if the schema filter is present but not functioning as expected."}
