However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left']. 3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. 4. Leave the dialog. 5. Verify that the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
