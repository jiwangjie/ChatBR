{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When viewing the report design, it can be observed that the <property name=\"fileName\" /> attribute stores an absolute path instead of a relative path. For example, it stores the absolute path as \"E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary\".", "EB": "The <property name=\"fileName\" /> attribute should store a relative path instead of an absolute path, to improve portability and flexibility of the report design. For example, it should store the relative path as \"lib1.rptlibrary\".", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:  \n1. Open the report design that includes a library.  \n2. Check the value of the <property name=\"fileName\" /> attribute in the library inclusion section. It should display an absolute path.  \n3. The expected behavior is that the <property name=\"fileName\" /> attribute should display a relative path.  \n4. Save the report design and verify that the <property name=\"fileName\" /> attribute now stores a relative path."}
