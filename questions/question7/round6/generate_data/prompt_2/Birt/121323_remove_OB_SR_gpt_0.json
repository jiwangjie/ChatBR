{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not retain the filter information after it is closed and reopened. The user suggests using plain XPath expressions, with the path from the data set selector appended, to allow filtering for those who need it.", "OB": "When I open the XML Edit Data Set dialog and apply a filter, such as selecting a specific node or using an XPath expression, the filter information is lost when I close the dialog. This means that I have to reapply the filter every time I open the dialog again.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should save the filter information so that it is retained when the dialog is closed and reopened. This would make it more convenient for users as they would not have to reapply the filter each time they open the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Apply a filter, such as selecting a specific node or using an XPath expression.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the dialog.\n5. Verify that the filter information is still retained and applied."}
