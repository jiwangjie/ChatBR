It either returns null or the wrong data.", "OB": "Bug 110566: Wrong data set result returned when setting an invalid filter expression for row[0]. The first result record is returned when previewing the data set after setting the filter.", "EB": "When setting an invalid filter expression for row[0], such as \"row[0] equals to 0\", it should return the expected result. As the developer mentioned, row[0] can only be generated after all the data has been fetched and should not be used as a filter expression.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Set a filter in the data set with the expression \"row[0] equals to \"\n2. Click on the Preview tab\n\nThe actual result is that the first result record is returned when previewing the data set. The expected result is that when setting an invalid filter expression for row[0], it should return the appropriate result based on the developer's explanation."}
