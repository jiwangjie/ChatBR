{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior treats XPath expressions in a way that can cause a lot of trouble.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left']. 3. Notice that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. 4. Leave the dialog. 5. Check that the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
