As a result, the drop-down button may be pushed off the visible area of the property sheet and gets clipped.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size itself to fit within the width of the property sheet column and ensure that the drop-down button remains visible at all times.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer and navigate to a page where ComboBoxCellEditor is used in column two.\n\n2. Make sure one of the strings in the drop-down list is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n\n3. Observe that the drop-down button of the ComboBoxCellEditor is pushed off the visible area and gets clipped.\n"}
