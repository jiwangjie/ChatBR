  "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.",
  "EB": "Users should receive a warning or a question message box when attempting to shut down Windows with unsaved changes in opened files, providing them with a chance to save their work before the shutdown/reboot process.",
  "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu, select the Shut Down command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nResults: There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s); the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. This behavior differs from other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.)."
