{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. If any of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item. However, this causes the drop-down button to be positioned too far to the right and outside the visible area of the property sheet. As a result, users cannot see the combo drop-down button without increasing the width of the property sheet view.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should resize correctly in the property sheet, ensuring that the drop-down button is always visible within the visible area of the property sheet, regardless of the width of the combo box items.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer. \n2. Edit an object using a set of rows containing name-value pairs in two columns. \n3. Use IPropertyDescriptor to create a cell editor that includes ComboBoxCellEditor. \n4. Provide strings to the ComboBoxCellEditor. \n5. Ensure that at least one of the strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. \n6. Observe that the combo box grows to accommodate the widest item, causing the drop-down button to extend beyond the visible area of the property sheet."}
