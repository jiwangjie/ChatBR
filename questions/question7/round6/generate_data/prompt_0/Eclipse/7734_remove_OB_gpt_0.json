{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without save file warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.", "EB": "The system should provide a \u201cDo you want to save your file\u201d dialog box with options for Yes, No, and Cancel. Selecting Cancel should halt the shutdown and allow the user to stop it. Additionally, it would be beneficial to allow applications to control the shutdown/save process and pop up their own windows if cancel is selected.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start WSWB and create a new project. 2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. 3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. 4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the \u201cShut Down\u2026\u201d command to shut down or reboot the computer."}
