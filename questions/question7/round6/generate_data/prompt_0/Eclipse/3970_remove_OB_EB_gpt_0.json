This is a problem especially when using Windows work stations as X terminals and running Eclipse on them.", "EB": "The software should provide a UI option in the preferences section to define the default line delimiters for new files. This option should be accessible and configurable for users running Eclipse on Windows work stations used as X terminals.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario:\n1. Set up a Unix and Windows work station environment.\n2. Use the Windows work station as an X terminal.\n3. Run Eclipse on the Windows work station.\n4. Look for the preferences section and check if there is an option available to define the default line delimiters for new files. "}
