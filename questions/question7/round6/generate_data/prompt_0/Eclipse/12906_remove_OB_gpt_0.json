Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your java file.\n2. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n3. In the Java Perspective, right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' > 'System Editor'.\n4. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the java file opened. Close it.\n5. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a java file by simply double clicking on it.\n6. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n7. Right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' > 'System Editor'.\n8. Nothing happens.\n\nThe expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed in the workbench, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, instructing the user to close all files first. We believe this is a safety feature where the software doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in the software."}
