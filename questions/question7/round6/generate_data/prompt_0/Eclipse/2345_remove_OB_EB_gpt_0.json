The file remains unchanged and does not open in the selected editor.", "EB": "When a file is already open and the user selects a different type of editor from the 'Open With...' menu, the file should be reopened in the selected editor, disregarding the fact that it is already open in a different editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open the software and create a new basic project. \n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml'. \n3. By default, the 'scripted resource editor example' is used to open the file, which ignores the XML file content. \n4. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'. \n5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...'. \n6. From the options, select 'Default Text Editor'. \n7. Observe that nothing happens and the file remains open in the scripted resource editor example. \n\nExpected: The file 'test.xml' should be reopened in the 'Default Text Editor' because it is a different editor type."}
