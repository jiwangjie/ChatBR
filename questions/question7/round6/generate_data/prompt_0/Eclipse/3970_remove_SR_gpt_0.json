However, this may not always be desired by the user.", "EB": "The new file should have Unix line delimiters, regardless of whether it is created on Windows, since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should be Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be used by all plugins to ensure consistency in the line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "Implement a UI in the Workbench to allow users to define the default line delimiter for new files. The UI should include options for Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. All plugins should be updated to use the selected line delimiter for new files."}
