", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly. It does not match the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would have expected the ComboBoxCellEditor to always be the same width as the property sheet column. It should work in the same way as the DialogCellEditor where the Button is always visible.", "SR": "Investigate the issue to determine whether this is a problem with our application or with SWT framework. Also, ensure that the ComboBoxCellEditor works the same way as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible."}
