{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project and specifies an existing bin directory as the output folder, there is no confirmation or warning message displayed. The project is created without checking if the bin directory can be scrubbed (deleted and rebuilt).", "EB": "After clicking on the 'Create Project' button, a confirmation dialog should appear to inform the user that the specified bin directory will be deleted and rebuilt during the project creation process.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Specify an existing bin directory as the output folder.\n3. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n\nExpected behavior:\nA confirmation dialog should appear, informing the user that the specified bin directory will be deleted and rebuilt during the project creation process."}
