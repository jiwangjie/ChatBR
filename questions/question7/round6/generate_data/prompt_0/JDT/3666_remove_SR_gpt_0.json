When adding a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method, the program needs to be corrected.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the enclosed class.\n2. Locate the 'bar' method.\n3. Add a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method.\n4. Observe the code that is generated by the code assist feature.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nInstead of generating 'baz(x.foo().foo())', it is expected that the code assist feature generates 'baz(x.foo(), x.foo())'.\n\nKUM (5/21/01 9:02:11 AM) - The text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure.\nMoved to ITPJCORE.PM (9/4/2001 2:58:56 PM) - An option was added.\nPM (9/25/2001 2:20:50 PM) - The option was removed.\n\nThe choice between replacing until the end or until the cursor location should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location). This issue should be moved to ITPJUI."}
