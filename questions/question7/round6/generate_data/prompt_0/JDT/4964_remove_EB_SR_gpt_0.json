Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type the following: \n\nbutton.dispose \n\nAt this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: \n\nDISPOSED \n\nintWidgetdispose() \n\nvoidWidget \n\nI then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: \n\nbutton.dispose(); \n\nBut as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "The automatic code assist feature should recognize that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. It should either prioritize the accurate match or be case sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: \n\n1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code. \n2. Type 'button.dispose' without realizing that code assist is active. \n3. Without selecting any suggestion from the code assist list, type '('. \n4. Observe that the code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. "}
