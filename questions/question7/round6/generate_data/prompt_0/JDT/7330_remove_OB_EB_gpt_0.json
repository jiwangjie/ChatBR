I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not (OK not all need to be in the context menu but all must be reachable from the editor e.g. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the Edit menu or any other global menu when selecting text in the editor. It can only be found when switching to the Outline view.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be available in the Edit menu or another global menu when selecting text in the editor. Users should not need to switch to the Outline view to access this action.", "SR": "To reproduce, select text in the editor and try to find the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the Edit menu or any other global menu. Switch to the Outline view to confirm that the action is available there."}
