{"id": "5473", "title": "ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the twolines are indented visually the same and then executing ShiftLeft, the text does not shift as expected. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the given scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (removing the tab character). Stray spaces in the input can also cause confusion, as the cause of the text not shifting becomes unclear.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that executing ShiftLeft after replacing the tab character with spaces should align the lines correctly and remove the visual indentation discrepancy. Any stray spaces should not prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces until both lines are visually indented the same. \n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command."}
