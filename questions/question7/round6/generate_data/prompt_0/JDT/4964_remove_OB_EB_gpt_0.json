{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, if the user types 'button.dispose', the code assist inserts 'button.DISPOSED' instead of 'button.dispose()', which is not the intended behavior.", "EB": "The automatic code assist feature should recognize that when the user types 'button.dispose', they are more likely intending to complete the method call 'button.dispose()' rather than referring to the constant 'button.DISPOSED'. If there is a match with the opening parenthesis '(', it should prioritize suggesting method calls over constants.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the IDE and create a new SWT project. \n2. Write code that includes an SWT button object, for example: 'Button button = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH);' \n3. Type 'button.dispose' without realizing that the code assist list is displayed. \n4. Observe that the code assist inserts 'button.DISPOSED' instead of 'button.dispose()'."}
