Type existence is not too expensive (done in the type wizard for the superclass) and could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g. ", "OB": "The browse button is too small and needs to use SWTUtil for standard button sizes. The title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found.' Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type can be a source type, but refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudochanges in all referencing classes.", "EB": "I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": ""}
