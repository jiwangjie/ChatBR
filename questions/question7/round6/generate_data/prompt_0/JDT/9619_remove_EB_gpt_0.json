When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'.\nOnly types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\nDestination type can be the source type: refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.", "OB": "Browse button is too small.\nTitle is used for long text.

Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Notice that the browse button is too small.\n3. Enter long text in the title field.\n4. Proceed to the next page of the dialog.\n5. Observe that it says 'Type not found'.\n6. Display the types in the dialog and notice that it shows types from folders other than the source folders of the current project.\n7.
