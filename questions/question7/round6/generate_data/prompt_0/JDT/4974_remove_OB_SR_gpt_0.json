{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the classpath and output location settings are not offered as one operation. Instead, they are set separately.", "EB": "The classpath and output location settings should be combined into one operation. This would make it more convenient for users to configure their desired settings.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the settings menu.\n3. Look for the options to set the classpath and output location.\n4. Notice that they are separate options.\n5. Attempt to set both the classpath and output location simultaneously.\n6. Observe that it is not possible to do so."}
