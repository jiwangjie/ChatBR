{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Build 200110251. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually. Execute ShiftLeft. The text now moves. I'm not sure how this is spec'd, but in the first scenario it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). At any rate, it's definitely confusing if there is a stray space. You don't know why the text won't shift.", "OB": "When the ShiftLeft operation is executed on a text editor with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text does not move as expected. The behavior is such that nothing moves when the operation is performed.", "EB": "Expect the ShiftLeft operation to shift the lines to the left, aligning them properly. In the case of intermixed tabs and spaces, the shift should occur up to the first non-whitespace character.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue in a default text editor, follow these steps:\n1. Type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text\n2. Now highlight the two lines above and execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n3. Notice that nothing moves as a result of the operation."}
