Currently, the actions on text selection seem to be distributed on a personal taste basis. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view just to access certain actions. We should make sure all actions are reachable from the editor, either in the context menu or via the Edit menu.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu when selecting text.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu when selecting text. All relevant actions should be easily accessible to users, either in the context menu or the Edit menu.", "SR": "1. Open the editor. 2. Select some text. 3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu. Check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available. 4. If the action is not available, switch to the Outline view or open the Edit menu to see if it is available there."}
