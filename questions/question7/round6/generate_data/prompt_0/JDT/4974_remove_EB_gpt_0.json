{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after setting the output location and classpath for a project, the following error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This issue arises because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. Consequently, when the output location is set first, it creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Open the project properties. \n3. Change the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location. \n4. Press 'Ok' to save the changes. \n5. Observe the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
