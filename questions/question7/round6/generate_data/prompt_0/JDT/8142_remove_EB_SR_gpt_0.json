I don't understand it.", "OB": "When I try to view the scoped type hierarchy for binary projects in the IDE (specifically, org.apache.ant), I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, what does the message mean?", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the IDE. 2. Load a binary project, such as org.apache.ant. 3. Navigate to the scoped type hierarchy view. 4. Observe the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'."}
