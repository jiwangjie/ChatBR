There should not be any stray spaces that prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   - A space\n   - A tab\n   - Some text\n   - A tab\n   - Some text\n3. Highlight the two lines above.\n4. Execute the ShiftLeft function.\n\nNotice that nothing moves, indicating incorrect behavior."}
