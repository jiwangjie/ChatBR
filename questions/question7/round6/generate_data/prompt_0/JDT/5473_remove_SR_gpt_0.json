", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, and then the ShiftLeft operation is executed, the text does not move as expected. It is unclear why the text does not shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, executing the ShiftLeft operation should result in the second line being shifted left and the first line being shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., getting rid of the tab). It should not be confusing when there is a stray space, and the user should be able to understand why the text won't shift.", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n3. Observe the behavior of the text. It should not move as expected."}
