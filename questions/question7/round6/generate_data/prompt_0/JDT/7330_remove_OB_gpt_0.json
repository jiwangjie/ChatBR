Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal preference, which is not clear to users. Some actions are in the context menu while others are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the Edit menu or any other global menu. It can only be found in the Outline view.", "EB": "I expected the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" to be accessible through the Edit menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Open the software and select some text.\n2. Navigate to the Edit menu and check if the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is available."}
