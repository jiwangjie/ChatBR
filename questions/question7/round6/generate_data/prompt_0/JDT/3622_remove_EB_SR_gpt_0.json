{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package feature, a message appears at the top saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. This message appears even before any input is provided in the package name field. The user is confused about the meaning of this message and whether it indicates an error. The package name field is currently empty at this point.", "EB": "The message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should not appear before the user types anything in the package name field. If this message is meant to be a warning, it should be visually differentiated from error messages, such as by using a different color or an error icon. Additionally, when the package name field is empty, the finish button should be disabled.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the New Package Wizard.\n2. Observe that the message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' appears at the top, even though the package name field is empty.\n3. Try to create a default package.\n4. Note that the package cannot be created by the user, as it is always present."}
