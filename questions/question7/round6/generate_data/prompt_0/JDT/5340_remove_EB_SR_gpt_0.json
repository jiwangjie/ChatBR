{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When trying to add an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately, and the exception list appears regardless of the cancellation request. This behavior ignores the cancellation request and does not disable the cancel button in the progress dialog.", "EB": "The software should either honor the cancellation request and prevent the exception list from appearing, or disable the cancel button in the progress dialog when the 'add exception breakpoint' operation is initiated.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software and navigate to the debugging settings.\n2. Start the process of adding an exception breakpoint.\n3. While the progress dialog is being displayed, try to cancel the operation by clicking on the cancel button.\n\nExpected result: The progress dialog should stay open and the operation should be cancelled, preventing the exception list from appearing.\n\n**Note:** When calling 'ProgressMonitorDialog.run', make sure to pass 'false' for the 'cancelable' parameter."}
