That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat server installed as a service on Windows, the server is able to shut down successfully. However, during the shutdown process, an error message is printed.", "EB": "If the server uses 1 as the shutdown port, it should shut down successfully without printing any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n 2. Start the service. \n 3. Stop the service. \n 4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling the Catalina.stop() method."}
