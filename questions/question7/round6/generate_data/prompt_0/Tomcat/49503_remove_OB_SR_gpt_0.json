  "description": "Bug 49503: Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.",
  "OB": "During the startup process, Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load() but only later in start().",
  "EB": "I would expect that in StandardServiceinitInternal() the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() is caught there, and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown. It is then caught in Catalinaload() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.",
  "SR": "1. Start Tomcat. 2. Observe that the first instance starts successfully, but Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load()."
