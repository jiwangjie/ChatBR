{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to ports in Catalina.load() and only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects version 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, allowing Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented by having separate methods Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() [1]. However, it seems that this implementation breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce this issue, follow the steps below:\n1. Start the first instance successfully.\n\nOB: The Connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method.\n\nEB: The Connectors should bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method.\n\nSR: Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties\norg.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time.", "OB": "The Connectors do not bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method.", "EB": "The Connectors should bind to their ports in the Catalina.load() method.", "SR": "Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties\norg.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n\n2.
