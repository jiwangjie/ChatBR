  "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works but prints error message",
  "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.",
  "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, the shutdown process works as intended, but it prints an error message.",
  "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, configure Tomcat with <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml3 and set it up as a Windows service. Perform the shutdown process and observe the error message during shutdown."
