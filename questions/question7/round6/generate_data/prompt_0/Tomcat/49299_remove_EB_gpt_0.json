However, when accessing the page in question, the cookie set is 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' with the value '658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F' and the URL generated for the 'Reload' link uses the default 'jsessionid': http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file. 2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/."}
