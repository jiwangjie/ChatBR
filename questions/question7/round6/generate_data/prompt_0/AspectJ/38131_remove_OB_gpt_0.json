This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nCreate a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command:\n\najc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. subpackage\\Test.java or javac subpackage\\Test.java. No big deal, really.", "OB": "When compiling a class in a subpackage using the 'ajc' command, a directory named 'subpackage' gets created within the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "EB": "The 'ajc' command should behave the same way as the 'javac' command, which does not create a nested 'subpackage' directory when compiling classes from a subpackage.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the 'ajc' command with the appropriate options and try compiling a class from a subpackage. Compare the directory structure generated with the 'javac' command for the same scenario."}
