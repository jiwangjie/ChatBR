This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n  }\n}\n\nThen compile using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nYou will see a directory 'subpackage' created under the existing 'subpackage' directory. subpackage\\Test.java\nor\njavac subpackage\\Test.java\n\nNo big deal, really.", "OB": "When compiling a class in a subpackage using ajc command without the -d option, a 'subpackage' directory is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "EB": "ajc creates a subdirectory with the same name as the subpackage when compiling a class from a subpackage.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage.\n2. Use the ajc command without the -d option to compile the class.\n3. Check if a 'subpackage' directory is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory."}
