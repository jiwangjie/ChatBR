{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "In the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved around. However, they do not have any effect on the image displayed. When opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they do not perform any action.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled, preventing users from moving them and giving the impression that they can scroll the image.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Build F2 (20020602) on Red Hat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2.10 (GTK2 only) 2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example. 3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they do not affect the image. 4. Open a small image, such as an icon, and observe that the scrollbars are misleading as they have no functionality."}
