However, if the steps of closing the editor tab, answering 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, and double-clicking on the file in the navigator to reopen it are repeated, it only takes about 8 seconds.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that selecting 'Revert' from the popup menu in the editor should be performed significantly faster than closing the editor tab, answering 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, and reopening the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and input a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3) Close the editor tab.\n4) When prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, choose 'no'.\n5) Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n6) Repeat steps 1) and 2).\n7) Select 'Revert' from the popup menu in the editor.\n8) Observe that it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original."}
