{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and automatically replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The software should not automatically replace the typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to type and input their desired value without interference.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the software. \n2. Choose the 'Edit' menu. \n3. Select 'Find/Replace...'. \n4. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field. \n5. Click on 'Find'. \n6. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. "}
