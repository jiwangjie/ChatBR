Somehow I don't think it's supposed to do that.", "OB": "When I choose the SWT.MULTI option in the ControlExampleText, it emits a beeping sound. Additionally, clicking on other buttons also triggers the bell sound.", "EB": "The ControlExampleText should not produce any sound when selecting the SWT.MULTI option, and clicking on other buttons should not generate any audible feedback either.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open ControlExampleText.\n2. Choose the SWT.MULTI option.\n3. Observe that a beeping sound is emitted.\n4. Click on other buttons in the ControlExampleText and notice that the bell sound is still present."}
