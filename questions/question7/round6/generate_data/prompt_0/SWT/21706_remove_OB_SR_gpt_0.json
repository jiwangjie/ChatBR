Since there are no non-static methods in this class, making the constructor private will prevent unnecessary instantiation. The size of the class will not increase as the compiler provides a free public constructor by default.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 platform.\n2. Look for the usage of Class.forName() method."}
