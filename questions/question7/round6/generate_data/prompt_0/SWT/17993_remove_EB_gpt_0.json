{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace should not replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace dialog is that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is commonly seen in browsers. However, it would be better if what is typed is not replaced with a value from the history. In the future, there may be potential for a full autocomplete feature to be implemented.", "OB": "When using the F1 build, I noticed that the Find/Replace dialog has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search and replaces what is typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, so the case of what is typed may be changed to match the value in the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "The software should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to enter their own search or replacement text without interference from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the software and navigate to the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...).\n2. Type 'hello' into the Find field and replace it with 'hi'.\n3. Perform a search for 'Hello'.\n4. Try to replace 'Hello' with 'Hi'.\n5. Notice that it is not possible to enter 'Hi' as the software automatically replaces 'Hello' with 'hi' due to the history search and autocomplete behavior.\n6. This limitation can be demonstrated by choosing Edit > Find/Replace..., typing 'a' into the Find field, clicking 'Find', and then attempting to type 'A' into the Find field."}
