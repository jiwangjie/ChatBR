Integration build 09/17. The layout of the text fields in the Project Properties Info page looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On Windows, the text fields appear fine. However, on motif platforms, these text fields display automatic borders, identifying them as user input targets. Furthermore, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. Instead, a more appropriate user interface element or design should be implemented to prevent the issues with automatic borders and different colored backgrounds.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Launch the software on any motif platform. 2. Navigate to the Project Properties Info page. 3. Observe the appearance of the text fields with automatic borders and different colored backgrounds."}
