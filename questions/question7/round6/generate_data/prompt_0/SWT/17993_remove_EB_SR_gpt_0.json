{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build is to replace what the user types in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields with a value from the history of recent searches. This behavior is similar to autocomplete commonly seen in browsers. However, it would be better if the user's typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. It should not modify the case of the user's input to match the case of the value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered.\n\nThis behavior of replacing the user's input with a value from the history makes it difficult or impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "OB": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build replaces the user's typed entry with a value from the history of recent searches. It also modifies the case of the user's input to match the case of the value from the history.", "EB": "The Find/Replace dialog should not replace the user's typed entry with a value from the history. It should maintain the case of the user's input and allow manual entry without auto-replacement.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Find/Replace dialog using the 'Edit' menu and selecting 'Find/Replace...'.\n2. Type an entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.\n3. Observe that the typed entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history of recent searches, if a matching entry is found.\n\nExpected result:\nThe user's typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. The user should be able to manually enter the desired search or replacement term without auto-replacement."}
