{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete,' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "The current behavior of Find/Replace should be changed to something more simple that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. However, it should still respect the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open a document so that 'Edit > Find/Replace...' becomes available.\n2. Type something in the 'Find' field or 'Replace With' field.\n3. Notice that if there is a matching entry from the previous search history, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history.\n4. Try to perform find or replace operations using the modified value from the history.\n5. Observe the difficulties encountered due to the undesired replacement behavior.\n\nThe behavior is similar for the 'Replace With' field."}
