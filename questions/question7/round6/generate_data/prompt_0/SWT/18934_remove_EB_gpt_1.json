  "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When using Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2.10 (GTK2 only), open the ImageAnalyzer example. The observed behavior is that the scrollbars are enabled. It is possible to move them around, but they do not have any effect. Particularly, when opening a small image such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading as they do not perform any action.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that, in the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars should be disabled when they do not have any functionality. Users should not be able to interact with non-functional scrollbars, providing a more accurate representation of the image display area.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Use Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2.10 (GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and movable.\n4. Open a small image, such as an icon.\n5. Notice that the scrollbars, despite being movable, do not have any effect, making them misleading."
