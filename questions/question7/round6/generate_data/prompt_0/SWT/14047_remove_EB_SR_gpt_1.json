  "title": "Bug 14047 - StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When appending N lines to StyledText in word wrap mode (build 20020416), it results in N redraws of the entire client area.",
  "EB": "I expect that when appending N lines to StyledText in word wrap mode, it should trigger a more efficient redraw mechanism, such as only redrawing the affected lines, rather than the entire client area.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the application in word wrap mode.\n2. Append N lines of text to the StyledText component.\n3. Observe that the entire client area is redrawn for each appended line, resulting in inefficient rendering."
