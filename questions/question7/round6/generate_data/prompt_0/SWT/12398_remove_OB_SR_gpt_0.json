I need to first click on one of the 'live' areas before it starts working (e.g., the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame).", "OB": "When opening the Help view, it does not initially allow keyboard navigation. The user has to manually click on a 'live' area, such as the banner with the tool buttons or the content frame, to enable keyboard navigation.", "EB": "We should be starting the Help view in a way that allows immediate keyboard navigation without requiring the user to click on a 'live' area.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Help view. 2. Attempt to navigate using the keyboard. Observe that keyboard navigation does not work. 3. Click on a 'live' area, such as the banner with the tool buttons or the content frame. 4. Attempt to navigate using the keyboard again. Observe that keyboard navigation now works."}
