Integration build 09/17. Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page displays text fields with automatic borders, which make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields on all motif platforms. The text fields should not have automatic borders, and they should have the same background color as the rest of the page.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Select a Project.\n2. Right-click and choose Properties.\n3. On the subsequent Info page, observe the readonly fields (e.g., Path, Type, etc.) that are displayed as text fields."}
