This is causing a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to remove the reflection usage in BidiUtil and find an alternative way to create the Callback object without relying on Class.forName().", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Use the CLDC version of SWT.\n2. Verify or use jxeLink (or similar tools).\n3. Observe that a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown when BidiUtil is accessed."}
