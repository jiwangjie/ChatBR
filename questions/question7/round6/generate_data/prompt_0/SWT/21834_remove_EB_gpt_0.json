This behavior is incorrect as the Launch item should remain on the second row.", "EB": "When the Delete button is pressed, the first item on the second row should be deleted, but the Launch item should stay on the second row.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Run the attached test case. \n2. Drag the Open Type coolitem to the second row (last coolItem). \n3. Drag the Launch coolitem (last coolItem on first row) to the second row, placing it after the Open Type item. \n4. Drag the Search coolitem to the second row, placing it after the Launch coolitem. \n5. Drag the Script coolitem to the second row (last coolItem on the first row), placing it after the Search coolitem. \n6. Press the Delete button. This will delete the first item on the second row. Notice that the second row is removed when the delete occurs, instead it should remain as it is."}
