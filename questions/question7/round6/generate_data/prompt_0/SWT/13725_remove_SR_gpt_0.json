This seems odd, since reverting the file contents should not take more time than simply closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "When answering 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog and double clicking on the file in the navigator to reopen it, the contents of the window are replaced with the original almost instantly. However, when repeating the steps and selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "Reverting the file contents should not take more time than closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1.
