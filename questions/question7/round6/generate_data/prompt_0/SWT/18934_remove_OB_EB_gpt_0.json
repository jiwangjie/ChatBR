However, they have no effect on the displayed image. When opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading as they don't perform any scrolling action.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled when they have no effect on the displayed image.", "SR": "1.
