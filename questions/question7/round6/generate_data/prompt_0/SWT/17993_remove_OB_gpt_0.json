{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers, but a full autocomplete feature could be provided in the future. For now, I think the current behavior should be changed to something more simple that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I believe the feature should be removed.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search. For example, searching for 'hello' and replacing it with 'hi', and then searching for 'Hello' and replacing it with 'Hi' is not possible.", "EB": "Currently, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software replaces the typed entry with a value from the search history. This behavior should be changed, and the software should allow the user to perform find and replace operations while still respecting the case of what the user types. The feature should no longer replace the typed entry with a value from the history.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document so that the 'Edit > Find/Replace...' option becomes available.\n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click on 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."}
