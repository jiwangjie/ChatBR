  "title": "Bug 14047 - StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When appending N lines to StyledText in word wrap mode, it results in N redraws of the entire client area. This behavior is inefficient and impacts performance.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when adding N lines to StyledText in word wrap mode, it should only trigger a redraw of the affected portion of the client area, not the entire area. This would improve performance and responsiveness.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open an application using StyledText in word wrap mode.\n2. Append N lines of text to the StyledText widget.\n3. Observe that the entire client area is redrawn N times, impacting performance."
