An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected.", "OB": "When entering an invalid date/time string in the report design, the system does not reject it and stores it incorrectly.", "EB": "(2) The date value should be validated by the user interface (UI) or the model before being stored in the report design.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the report design form. 2. Enter an invalid date/time string in one of the fields. 3. Save the report design. The system should validate the date value and reject it if it is not in a valid format."}
