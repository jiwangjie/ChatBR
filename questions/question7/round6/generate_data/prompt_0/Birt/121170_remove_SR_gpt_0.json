Since the labels need to be displayed to the end user before extraction, the method should return the same labels as after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Perform an extraction without calling the 'get column label' method.\n2. Call the 'get column label' method and observe that the labels are null.\n3. Perform the extraction again.\n4. Call the 'get column label' method and observe that the labels are now recognizable strings."}
