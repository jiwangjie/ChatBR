There is no difference in the content displayed regardless of the content type chosen.", "EB": "I expect the report to display different results based on the dynamic text element's content type. \n- For the Plain content type, I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed. \n- For the Auto content type, I expect content 1, 2, and 3 to be displayed properly without any HTML or RTF tags. \n- For the HTML content type, I expect content 1 and 2 to be displayed properly without any HTML tags, while content 3 should be displayed literally with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the report. \n2. Set the dynamic text element's content type to Auto. \n3. Observe the displayed results. \n4. Repeat the process with the content type set to Plain and HTML, respectively. Compare the displayed results for each content type."}
