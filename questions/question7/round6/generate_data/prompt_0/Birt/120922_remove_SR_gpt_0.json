Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog titled 'Error' (including the quotes) asks 'Do you want to save the changes? <Yes <No <Cancel>': Yes would save the changes, No would discard the changes, and Cancel would do nothing and remain on the Source page.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then trying to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the changes need to be saved. The problem is that the user has to figure out what action is required to save or discard the changes, and the error message provided is not very clear. The error message displayed is 'Source page is dirty.'", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a clear notification stating 'XML Report Design has been changed'. Additionally, the dialog should use a more appropriate title and should not include the quotes.", "SR": ""}
