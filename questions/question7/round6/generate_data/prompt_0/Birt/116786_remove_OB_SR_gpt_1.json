  "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer currently generates and saves the absolute path instead of the expected relative path. For instance, if the report design is located at $project/test, the absolute path is stored instead of the relative path.",
  "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. For example, if the report design is in $project/test, the library path should be stored as a relative path.",
  "SR": "1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library in the report.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Verify that the library path is stored as a relative path, considering the location of the report design."
