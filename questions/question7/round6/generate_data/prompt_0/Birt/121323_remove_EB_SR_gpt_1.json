  "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "Entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'] in the XML Edit Data Set dialog results in the selection being stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. Upon leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.",
  "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information along with the XPath expression for column mapping. The stored data, including selections with parts like section[@id='left'], should be retained even after exiting the dialog. Treating XPath expressions in this manner may lead to data loss and should be addressed to ensure accurate and consistent behavior.",
  "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for column mapping, e.g., section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe the stripping of the selection, and the storage of the selection in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class.\n4. Exit the dialog and check if the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, and verify if the data stored in filterInfo is retained."
