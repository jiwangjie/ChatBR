{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "In the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information does not persist. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to a lot of trouble.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog and open it again.\n5. Notice that the filter information is not persisted and the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
