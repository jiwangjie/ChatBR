{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path for the library include. Instead, it should save the relative path.", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test, the relative path for the included library should be saved.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the BIRT designer. \n2. Create or open a report design. \n3. Include a library in the report design. \n4. Save the report design and observe that the library include is stored with the absolute path instead of the relative path."}
