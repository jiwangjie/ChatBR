{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located at $project/test, and a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary is included, the BIRT designer should store the relative path, ensuring that the library can be accessed correctly.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design located at $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Close and reopen the report design.\n6. Check the library inclusion to ensure that the relative path is stored correctly."}
