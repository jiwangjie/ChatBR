{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path for included libraries. For example, <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/> and <property name='namespace' value='lib1'/>. This means that the library path is hardcoded and not relative to the project location.", "EB": "The report design should save the relative path of the included library rather than the absolute path. For example, it should be saved as <property name='fileName' value='$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Navigate to the BIRT designer.\n2. Open a report design.\n3. Include a library using the absolute path.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Close and reopen the report design to verify that the absolute path is still stored instead of the relative path."}
