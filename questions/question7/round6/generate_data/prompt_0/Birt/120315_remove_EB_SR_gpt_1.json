  "description": "When the display property of an item is set to 'none', it doesn't take effect in the new PDF emitter.",
  "OB": "When the display property of an item is set to 'none' in the new PDF emitter, the item remains visible instead of being hidden as expected.",

  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the new PDF emitter.\n2. Set the display property of an item to 'none'.\n3. Generate a PDF containing the item.\n4. Observe that the item is still visible in the generated PDF, contrary to the expected behavior."
