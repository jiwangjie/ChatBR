The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, and it takes a while to load. Eventually, a message appears saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "The tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand instead of querying the entire schema at once. The loading of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the long wait time during the loading of the entire schema. Eventually, the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' should appear. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on the schema."}
