{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, you have to wait for the entire schema to be queried. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query is opened, the entire schema is queried, causing a delay. The delay is followed by a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load the tables and columns on demand, instead of querying the entire schema upfront. This will eliminate the delay and prevent the display of the message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query. \n2. Observe the delay caused by the query to the entire schema. \n3. Notice the message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. \n\nExpected: The tables and columns should be loaded on demand, without any delay or display of the message."}
