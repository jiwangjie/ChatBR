Please refer to the attached report for more details.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Prepare a database field with three types of content:\n   a) HTML text within <html>...</html> tags\n   b) HTML fragments not within <html> tags\n   c) Text with RTF tags\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field in a report."}
