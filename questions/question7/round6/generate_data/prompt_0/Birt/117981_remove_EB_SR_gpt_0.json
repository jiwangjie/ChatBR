Open the library outline view.\n2. Attempt to select any item in the view.\n\nObserved Behavior (OB): When attempting to select an item in the library outline view for the first time, the focus jumps to the library file node in the outline view instead. It is not possible to select any other items initially.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB): When attempting to select an item in the library outline view, the item should be selected without the focus jumping to the library file node. Users should be able to select any item in the view directly.\n\nSteps to Reproduce (SR):\n1. Open the library outline view.\n2. Attempt to select any item in the view.\n3. Observe that the focus jumps to the library file node instead of selecting the intended item."}
