The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "Currently, the tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query loads all the tables and columns from the data source as soon as the page is loaded.", "EB": "The tree in the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query should load the tables and columns on demand. It should only load the tables and columns when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query. 2. Observe the tree control and note that it loads all the tables and columns from the data source. 3. Expand the tree or apply a filter and verify that the tables and columns are loaded on demand."}
