When the ComboBoxCellEditor is used in the property sheet view, it does not expand to fit the content of the drop-down list. As a result, the items in the drop-down list are truncated or clipped. This behavior makes it challenging for users to select the desired option.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet view should expand or size itself properly to accommodate the content of the drop-down list. This will ensure that all items in the drop-down list are fully visible to the users, allowing them to easily select the desired option.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the property sheet view.\n2. Select a property that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Observe the size of the drop-down list.\n4. Add enough items to the drop-down list to cause scrolling or truncation.\n5. Notice that the ComboBoxCellEditor does not expand to show all items in the drop-down list properly."}
