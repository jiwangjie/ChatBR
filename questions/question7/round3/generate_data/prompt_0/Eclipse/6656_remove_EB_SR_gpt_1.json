{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On Linux, running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000), when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items such as the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) move below the label. This behavior may confuse users.", "EB": "These two tool items are expected to stay on the same line. The close button should remain located to the far right corner.", "SR": "1. Open the software on Linux using build 20011127.2. Open a view, such as the Navigator.3. Resize the view to a smaller size.4. Observe the position of the tool items, specifically the pulldown menu icon and the close icon."}
