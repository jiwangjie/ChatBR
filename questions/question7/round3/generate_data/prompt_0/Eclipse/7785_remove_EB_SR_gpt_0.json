Additionally, the file icon should remain consistent with the java file icon.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1) Open an existing java file.\n2) Modify the java file (e.g., move an existing class).\n3) Click on the SaveAs icon.\n4) Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a location for the file.\n5) Type a filename without including the file extension.\n6) Click Ok to save the file.\n\nNote: Ensure that the Navigator is visible to observe the file's presence without the file extension."}
