", "OB": "The current behavior does not provide a UI for defining the default line delimiters for new files. As a result, new files created on Windows have Windows line delimiters, even though the end product is a Unix product.", "EB": "I expect that there should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, and Unix default platform line delimiters. The UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure consistency across all plugins in using the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, consider the following scenario: Use both Unix and Windows workstations to develop a Unix product. Create a new file on Windows and observe the line delimiters used."}
