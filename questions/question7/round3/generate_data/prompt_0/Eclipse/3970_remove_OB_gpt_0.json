There should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, consider the following scenario: Use a Unix and Windows workstation to develop a Unix product/program."}
