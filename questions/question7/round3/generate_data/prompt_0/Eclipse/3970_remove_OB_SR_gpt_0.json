There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The UI should allow users to choose from the following possible values: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, or the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be consistent across all plugins.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Launch Eclipse on a Windows work station.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiters used for the newly created file."}
