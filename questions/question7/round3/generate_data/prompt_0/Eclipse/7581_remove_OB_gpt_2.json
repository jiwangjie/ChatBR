{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com... ", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet grows to the width of the largest item, causing the drop-down button to be positioned off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "I would have expected behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as DialogCellEditor (Button always visible). Will need to investigate to determine if this is an issue with our implementation or SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Select an object and try to edit it.\n3. If any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combobox grows to accommodate the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be clipped. \n4. To see the entire dropdown button, the property sheet view needs to be widened."}
