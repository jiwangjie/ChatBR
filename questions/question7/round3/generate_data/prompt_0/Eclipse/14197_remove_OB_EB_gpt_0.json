{"id": "14197", "title": "Bug 14197: Removing a working set immediately applies changes", "description": "When a working set is removed, the changes are immediately applied without any prompt or confirmation.", "OB": "After removing a working set, the package view is immediately filtered and only shows the packages/projects that are part of the remaining working set. The user is not prompted or warned about the immediate application of this change.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a working set is removed, the package view should not be immediately filtered. Instead, the user should be prompted with a confirmation dialog asking if they want to apply the changes or discard them.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a working set with one project and select it. Notice that the package view is filtered and only shows the packages/projects in the working set.\n2. Open the working set dialog again and create a second working set.\n3. Delete the first working set. Notice that the package view is immediately filtered again without any prompt or confirmation."}
