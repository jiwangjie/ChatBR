{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view is resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "When the view (such as the Navigator) is resized smaller on Linux, the close button and the pulldown menu icon (triangle) move below the label. This behavior is observed in build 20011127 but not in build 20011116 on Nt2000.", "EB": "The close button and pulldown menu icon should stay on the same line as the label, regardless of how small the view is. Users expect the close button to be located to the far right corner of the label, and this usability issue might confuse them.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue on Linux:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Resize the view (such as the Navigator) to make it smaller.\n3. Observe that the close button and the pulldown menu icon move below the label."}
