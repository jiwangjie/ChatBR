System Editor', nothing happens. The workbench should display a warning message informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue, or display an error message instructing the user to close all other files first. This behavior is believed to be a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "When the Java Perspective is active, if a java file is already opened, and the user right-clicks on the java file and selects 'Open With ..
