Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' followed by 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will appear with the Java file opened. Close this window.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by double clicking on it.\n4. Right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' followed by 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected: The workbench should display a warning message stating that you may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue, or an error message indicating that you should close all files first.\n\nAdditionally, we believe this behavior is a safety feature where the software does not allow external editing while a file is already opened within the software."}
