{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s); the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.)", "EB": "The system should provide a \u201cDo you want to save your file\u201d dialog box with options like Yes, No, and Cancel. Selecting Cancel should halt the shutdown. Additionally, it would be helpful to allow applications to control the shutdown/save process or to have their own windows pop up, giving users the option to stop the shutdown if cancel is selected.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n3. Left-click on the Windows Start menu and select the \u201cShut Down\u2026\u201d command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nResults: The system shuts down/reboots immediately without displaying a warning or question message box to allow users to save their dirty model(s)."}
