", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly when the width of the strings in the cell is wider than the width of the property sheet column. As a result, the drop down button of the combo box may be off the visible area of the property sheet and gets clipped. Users have to widen the property sheet view until the button becomes visible again.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should resize itself properly in the property sheet when the width of the strings in the cell exceeds the width of the property sheet column. The drop down button of the combo box should always be visible within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the property sheet view. \n2. Edit an object using the row of name-value pairs in two columns. \n3. Make sure at least one string in one of the columns is wider than the width of the property sheet column. \n4. Observe that the drop down button of the combo box is off the visible area and gets clipped. \n5. To make the button visible, widen the property sheet view until the button comes into the visible area."}
