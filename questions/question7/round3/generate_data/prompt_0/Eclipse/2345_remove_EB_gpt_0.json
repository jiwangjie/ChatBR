Create a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named test.xml\n3. Select the test.xml file in the Navigator.\n4. Choose 'Open With' and select 'Default Text Editor'.\n\nThe expected behavior is that a new editor should open for the selected file since the editor type is different. However, nothing happens, and the scripted resource editor example is reactivated instead.", "EB": "When opening a file with a different editor type, a new editor should be opened for the file instead of reactivating the currently open editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
