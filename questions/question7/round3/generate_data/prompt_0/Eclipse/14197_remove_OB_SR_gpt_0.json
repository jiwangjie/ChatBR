{"id": "14197", "title": "Bug 14197: Removing a working set immediately makes changes", "description": "When removing a working set, changes are immediately reflected without confirmation or cancellation option.", "OB": "Currently, when a working set is removed, the package view in the background refreshes and applies the changes without any confirmation dialog or cancellation option. This behavior applies not only to the removal of the entire working set but also to individual changes made within the working set.", "EB": "At the moment of deletion, the package view in the background should not immediately refresh and apply the changes. Instead, there should be a confirmation dialog allowing the user to cancel the removal and revert any changes made to the working set. This dialog should only appear when closing the working set selection dialog, not during any manipulation within the working set.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the working set selection dialog.\n2. Select a working set to remove.\n3. Click on the 'Remove' button.\nExpectedly, a confirmation dialog should appear asking for confirmation to proceed with the removal and apply the changes. This dialog should also provide a cancellation option to revert the removal and any changes made to the working set."}
