There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.)", "EB": "When a WSWB session is open and there are unsaved changes in any opened .txt file, a warning or question message box should be displayed when the user tries to shut down or reboot the computer. The message should provide users with the option to save their unsaved changes before proceeding with the shutdown/reboot process.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project. \n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. \n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. \n4. Left-click on the Windows Start menu, select the 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer. \n\nExpected results: \n\nA warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their unsaved changes before proceeding with the shutdown/reboot process."}
