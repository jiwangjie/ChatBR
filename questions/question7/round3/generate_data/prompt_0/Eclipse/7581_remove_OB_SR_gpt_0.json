It does not match the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I would expect the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. It should work the same as DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the property sheet. \n2. Edit a cell using the ComboBoxCellEditor. \n3. Observe that the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column."}
