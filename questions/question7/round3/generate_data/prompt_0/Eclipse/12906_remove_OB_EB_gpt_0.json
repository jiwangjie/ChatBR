The user should be given the option to continue and potentially overwrite changes or cancel the operation.", "SR": "1. Make sure you have an associate Windows editor for your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go to the Java Perspective and open a java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected: The workbench should display a warning message saying that you may overwrite changes and ask if you want to continue, or display an error message saying that you should close all files first before opening in another editor.\n\nNote: We believe it's a safety feature where WSAD doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."}
