{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without save file warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to provide a 'Do you want to save your file', Yes, No, Cancel (which halts the shutdown) dialog box. One other nice feature might be to allow the applications to control the shutdown/save also or to pop up their own windows that would also (if cancel is selected) allow the user to stop the shutdown.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Start WSWB and create a new project. 2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. 3. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select 'Shut Down...' command to shutdown/reboot the computer."}
