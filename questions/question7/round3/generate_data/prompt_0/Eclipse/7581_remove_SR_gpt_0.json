", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet.", "EB": "I would expect the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as the DialogCellEditor with the button always visible. We will need to investigate to determine if this is an issue with our software or with SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit).", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the property sheet. \n2. Navigate to the column where ComboBoxCellEditor is located. \n3. Note that the size of the combo box does not match the width of the column in the property sheet."}
