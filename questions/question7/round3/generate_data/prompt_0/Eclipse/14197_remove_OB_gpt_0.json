This behavior occurs during manipulation of working sets.", "EB": "The package view should only refilter when the working set selection dialogue is closed, not during working set manipulation. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to the working sets, including canceling the remove action.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Create a working set with one project and select it. The package view will be filtered.\n2. Open the working set dialog again, create a second working set, and delete the first working set."}
