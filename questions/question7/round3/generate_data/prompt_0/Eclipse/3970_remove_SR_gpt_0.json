The Windows workstations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes).", "OB": "When creating a new file, we currently use the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are: Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files. NOTES:", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter used for the new file."}
