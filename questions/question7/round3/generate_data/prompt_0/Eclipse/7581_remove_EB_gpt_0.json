{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor sizing issue in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows editing of objects using a set of rows that consist of name-value pairs in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. An IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, which I use to create editors that include the ComboBoxCellEditor constructor, which can be given strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column.\n\nA problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It appears that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The problem is that the drop-down button may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet, so it is clipped. From a user experience perspective, they can no longer see the combo box drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. When a string in the drop-down list is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. As a result, the drop-down button may be clipped and become invisible to the user.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should dynamically adjust its size to show the entire drop-down button, even if a string in the list is wider than the width of the property sheet column. The drop-down button should always remain visible to the user.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Edit an object that has a property with a ComboBoxCellEditor as the cell editor.\n3. Ensure that one of the strings in the drop-down list is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box grows to accommodate the width of the widest string, potentially causing the drop-down button to be invisible or clipped."}
