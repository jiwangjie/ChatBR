The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When using the SaveAs functionality, the file is saved without a file extension. The Navigator displays the file without the file extension.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original unless explicitly changed. The file should be displayed with the correct file extension in the Navigator.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1) Open an existing java file.\n2) Make modifications to the file.\n3) Click the SaveAs icon, located next to the Save Icon.\n4) A dialog will appear.\n5) Browse for a valid container location.\n6) Type the filename without the extension (as the extension is not requested).\n7) Click OK.\n\nObserve that the file is saved in the specified location but does not have a file extension displayed in the Navigator."}
