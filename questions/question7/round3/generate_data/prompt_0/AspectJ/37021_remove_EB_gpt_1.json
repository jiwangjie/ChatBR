See 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' for code to reproduce the problem. Note that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification. (AJDT may omit filenames that make no sense to it.)", "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Additionally, there are cases where the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that specific problem.", "EB": "The declare warning messages should correctly display the source path in the format 'app/Main' for .class files from injars.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code from 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'\n2. Observe the declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars.\n3. Verify that the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
