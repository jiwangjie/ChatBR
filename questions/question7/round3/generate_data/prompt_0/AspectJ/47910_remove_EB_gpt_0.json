{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.", "OB": "When calling ajc with the parameters 'sourceroots <mydir' and 'outjar <my.jar', an output file is generated with a .jar extension. However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation suggests that the 'outjar' parameter should put the output classes in a zip file, but having a parameter called 'outjar' that creates a zip file is confusing.", "EB": "The generated output file should be a valid jar file that includes a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Call ajc with the parameters 'sourceroots <mydir' and 'outjar <my.jar'.\n2. Check the generated <my.jar file and observe that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
