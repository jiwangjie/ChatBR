However, currently, the resulting jar file does not contain the 'MANIFEST.MF' file.", "OB": "The 'outjar' option creates an output file with a '.jar' extension, but it is not a valid jar file because it does not have a 'MANIFEST.MF' file inside.", "EB": "If the 'outjar' option is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file that includes a 'MANIFEST.MF' file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Call 'ajc' with the option 'sourceroots' and specify the source directory.\n2. Use the 'outjar' option and provide the desired output jar file name.\n3. Verify that the output file is created with a '.jar' extension.\n4. Check that the resulting jar file does not contain a 'MANIFEST.MF' file."}
