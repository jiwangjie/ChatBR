See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the issue. However, these tests have limitations as they may return false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages. In AJDT, if the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "The source path listed in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars is in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\".", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form \"app/Main\" instead of \"app.Main.class\".", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Observe the source path listed in the declare warning message for .class files from injars."}
