The bug is observed in [java|aj] and can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. It should be noted that these tests have limitations and may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It is also observed that AJDT omits the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for binary files is displayed in the format 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be displayed as 'app/Main.class' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Navigate to the tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. 2. Run the code within this directory. 3. Observe the declare warning messages for binary files and note that the source path is displayed incorrectly."}
