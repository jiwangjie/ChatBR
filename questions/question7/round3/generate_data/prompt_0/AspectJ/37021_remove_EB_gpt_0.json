Please refer to 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' for the code that can be run to reproduce the problem. It is important to note that the tests have limitations and may result in false positives due to the absence of filename checking in the harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, the filename may be omitted if it does not make sense to AJDT.)", "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath appears as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that the filenames may not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that particular problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open declare warning messages in files targeting .class files from injars. \n2. Observe that the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. "}
