It appears that the ajc command is supposed to create a zip file, but the resulting file is not a valid jar file.", "OB": "When using the ajc command with the parameters sourceroots, outjar, <mydir, and <my.jar, an output file with a .jar extension is created. However, the resulting file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "If the outjar parameter is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run the ajc command with the following parameters: \n  ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar \n2. Check the resulting file for the presence of a MANIFEST.MF file."}
