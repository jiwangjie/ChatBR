{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.", "OB": "When I run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar', an output file is created with a .jar extension. However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc suggests that the 'outjar' parameter is supposed to create a zip file, but it does not logically make sense for a parameter called 'outjar' to create a zip file without a required MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when using the 'outjar' parameter with ajc, the generated jarfile should contain a valid MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the command line interface.\n2. Navigate to the directory containing the source files ('mydir').\n3. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar'.\n4. Verify that the generated 'my.jar' file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
