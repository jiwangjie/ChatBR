That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat stops regardless of this error message. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() method performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "The error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' should not be printed when using 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service. The server should still stop successfully without any error messages.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal (e.g., by calling Catalina.stop())."}
