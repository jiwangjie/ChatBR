Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1. The first instance starts successfully.\n[1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html\n\nDowngrading user\n\nWhen running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80).\n\nI do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.\n\n3. Actual behaviour:\n\nThe exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called.\n\nThe startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "The connector does not try to bind to the port in Catalina.load(), but later binds when start() is called.
