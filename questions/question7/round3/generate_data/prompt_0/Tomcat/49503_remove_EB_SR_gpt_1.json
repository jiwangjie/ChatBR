Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.\n[1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html\nDowngrading user: When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. 3. Actual behaviour: The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "OB": "The connectors do not bind to their ports during the `Catalina.load()` method, but only when the `start()` method is called. This behavior is observed when running Tomcat with `jsvc`. The second instance fails to start in the expected way. Specifically, the exception does not occur because the connector does not attempt to bind to the port. Instead, it binds when `start()` is called. The startup sequence continues and eventually fails in `Server.await()`.", "EB": "The connectors should bind to their ports during the `Catalina.load()` method, allowing them to be ready to accept connections before other parts of Tomcat are started. This behavior is expected when running Tomcat with `jsvc`. When the second instance is started, it should fail with the expected exception instead of delaying the binding of the connector to the port until `start()` is called.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1.
