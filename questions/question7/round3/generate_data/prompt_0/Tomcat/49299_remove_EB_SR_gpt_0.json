However, the observed behavior is that the page sends the following cookie: Set-Cookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. But when reloading the page using the provided 'Reload' link, it appends 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name to the URL: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL (assuming URL rewriting is enabled). In this case, the 'Reload' link should use the custom cookie name instead of 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Configure a web application to use a custom name for session tracking cookies.\n2. Enable URL rewriting.\n3. Access a page that requires session tracking.\n4. Observe the cookie being set with the custom name.\n5. Click on the provided 'Reload' link.\n6. Observe that the URL includes 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name."}
