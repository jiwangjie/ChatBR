{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.", "OB": "When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way. The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "Connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load() and not wait until start() is called. This will ensure that Tomcat is able to bind to privileged ports (such as port 80) when running with jsvc. The startup sequence should complete successfully without any errors in Server.await().", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
