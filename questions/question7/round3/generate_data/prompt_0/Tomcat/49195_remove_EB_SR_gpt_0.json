{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service in Tomcat, it works as expected but prints an error message in the catalina.20100427.log file. The error message is 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' It should be noted that despite this error message, Tomcat is successfully stopped. After printing the error message, the method Catalina.stopServer() invokes System.exit(1) for the Tomcat shutdown process. It is worth mentioning that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the variable Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "The error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' should not be displayed when using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service in Tomcat.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml file.\n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service.\n3. Check the catalina.20100427.log file for the error message 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'"}
