{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrapload(String[]) and Bootstartstart() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80). I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960.", "OB": "The issue occurs when the second instance of Tomcat starts. The exception from connector.init() is not thrown because the connector does not try to bind to the port at that time. Instead, it binds when the start() method is called. However, the startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "In StandardServiceinitInternal(), I would expect the connector.init() call to fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalinaload() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug: 1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully. 2. Start the second instance of Tomcat and observe the issue where the connector does not bind to the port in Catalina.load() but waits until start() is called. The startup sequence should continue and fail in Server.await()."}
