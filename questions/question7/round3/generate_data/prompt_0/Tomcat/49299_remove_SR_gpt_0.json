{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 incorrect statement about custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "Bug 49299Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 says that custom cookie name affects URL rewriting", "OB": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the actual result is that the page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' and the Reload link on the page uses the parameter name 'jsessionid' instead of the custom name.", "EB": "The expected result is that if the statement in 7.1.1 is followed, the Reload link should be 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F'.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the web application\n2. Enable URL rewriting in the application configuration\n3. Verify that a custom name for the session tracking cookie is set\n4. Use the Reload link on the page\n5. Observe the URL generated and check if the custom name is used in the URI parameter"}
