{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, the software works as expected and shuts down properly. However, an error message is printed during the shutdown process.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use the interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread). The error message should not be printed during the shutdown process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml configuration file.\n2. Start the Windows service.\n3. Shutdown the Windows service.\n4. Observe the error message printed during the shutdown process."}
