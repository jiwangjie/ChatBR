Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.

The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in Catalina.load() and then rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.4.", "SR": "1.
