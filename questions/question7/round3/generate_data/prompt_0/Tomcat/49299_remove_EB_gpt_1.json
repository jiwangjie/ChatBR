However, upon testing, the actual behavior is different. The page sends a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but the 'Reload' link on the page uses the default 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name. The URL generated looks like this: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session ID is encoded in the URL. This should occur when URL rewriting is enabled.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Deploy the attached 'cookiename.war' file. \n2. Access the URL 'http://localhost:8080/cookiename/'. \n3. Observe the behavior of the session tracking cookies and the 'Reload' link on the page."}
