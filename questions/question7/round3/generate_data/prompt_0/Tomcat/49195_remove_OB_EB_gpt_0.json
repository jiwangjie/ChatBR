There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behavior, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When Tomcat is installed as a service on Windows and the <Server port='1'> configuration is used in the server.xml file, an error message is printed during shutdown.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when shutting down Tomcat with <Server port='1'> configuration.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
