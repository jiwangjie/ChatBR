{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service of Tomcat, the service works properly and shuts down as expected. However, an error message is printed during the shutdown process.", "EB": "If using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service of Tomcat, it should work without printing any error messages during the shutdown process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, for example, by calling Catalina.stop()."}
