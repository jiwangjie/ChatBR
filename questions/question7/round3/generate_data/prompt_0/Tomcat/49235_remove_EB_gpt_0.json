However, the expected output is 'MySomeClass'. This issue seems to be related to the Servlet 3.0 specification. It's worth noting that the code works fine on Glassfish 3.0.", "OB": "When calling the ServletContainerInitializer onStartup() method with a Set<Class<?>> classSet, the output 'MySomeAnn' is printed.", "EB": "I expect the output to be 'MySomeClass'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Build Tomcat 7.0.0 from the SVN r939221.\n2. Use the following code:\n\n@MySomeAnn\npublic class MySomeClass { ... }\n\n@HandlesTypes(MySomeAnn.class)\npublic class ModuleInitializer implements ServletContainerInitializer {\n  @Override\n  public void onStartup(Set<Class<?>> classSet, ServletContext ctx) throws ServletException {\n    for (Class<?> targetClass : classSet) {\n      System.out.println(targetClass.getName());\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n3. Run the code and observe that the output is 'MySomeAnn' instead of 'MySomeClass'."}
