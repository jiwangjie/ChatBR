{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well.In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started.IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.", "OB": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "EB": "The Connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load() instead of waiting until start().", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time.\n2. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n3. Observe that the Connectors do not bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() phase."}
