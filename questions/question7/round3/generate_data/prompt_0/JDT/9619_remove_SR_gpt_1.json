{"id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619: Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "Bug 9619Move static member: Dialog details 20020212a. Mnemonicsb. No validation on the type field. Type existance is not too expensive (donein the type wizard for super class), so could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g. ", "OB": "The browse button is too small. The title is used for long text. When going to the next page, it says 'Type not found'. Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog. The destination type can be a source type, but refactoring warns that this will result in errors (which is not true) and makes pseudochanges in all referencing classes.", "EB": "I would suggest using the title for 'Move static field(s)' and using the description for 'x fields from xx'. The selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the dialog for moving a static member. 2. Try entering a type that does not exist. 3. Go to the next page and observe the error message. 4. Also, try selecting a destination type that is a source type and check the warning message and the changes made in referencing classes."}
