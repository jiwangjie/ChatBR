{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Edit (or some other global) menu. 2. Check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is present in the context menu. If not, switch to the Outline view and check again."}
