{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, it should be confirmed that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the software should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. This will ensure that the bin directory, containing more than just .class files, can be properly updated and all the necessary files can be rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory that contains files other than the .class files.\n3. Verify that the software does not confirm the ability to delete and rebuild the output directory."}
