{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation doesn't confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files. These additional files cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Specify the output directory as a bin directory that contains files other than .class files. \n3. Proceed with the project creation to see if the confirmation message regarding the scrubbing of the bin directory is displayed."}
