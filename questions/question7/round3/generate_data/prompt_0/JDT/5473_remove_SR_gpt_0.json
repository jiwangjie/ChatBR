It is not clear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, effectively getting rid of the tab. In any case, if there is a stray space, it becomes confusing why the text won't shift.", "EB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, executing the ShiftLeft operation should move the text.
