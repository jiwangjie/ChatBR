{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330: Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the Edit menu or any other global menu. It is also not visible in the context menu when selecting text.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the Edit menu or some other global menu, and also in the context menu when text is selected.", "SR": "1. Open the Edit menu or any other global menu.\n2. Select text in the editor.\n3. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the menu.\n4. Switch to the Outline view.\n5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to check if the action is now available in the context menu."}
