{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there is no confirmation or check performed to ensure that the output directory (bin directory) can be deleted and rebuilt. This can lead to issues when some users create projects and point the output folder at a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "To resolve this bug, project creation should include a confirmation step or check to ensure that the bin directory can be successfully scrubbed (deleted and rebuilt) without any issues. This will help avoid potential problems when users create projects and point the output folder to a bin directory containing unnecessary files.", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Select to create a new project.\n3. Choose an existing directory structure for the project.\n4. Set the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n5. Proceed with the project creation.\n6. Observe that there is no confirmation or check performed to verify the scrubbing of the bin directory."}
