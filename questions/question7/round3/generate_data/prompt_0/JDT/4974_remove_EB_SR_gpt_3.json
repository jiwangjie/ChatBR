{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing the 'Ok' button, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue arises because setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations. By setting the output location first, an illegal state is created.", "EB": "The software should allow the setting of classpath/output location as one operation. Additionally, the error message should correctly state that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Set the output location. 2. Set the classpath. Press the 'Ok' button and observe the error message."}
