Build 200110251.", "OB": "When executing the ShiftLeft operation on lines that contain both tabs and spaces, the text does not move as expected. Noticing that nothing moves.", "EB": "After executing the ShiftLeft operation, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least to the space character, effectively replacing the tab with spaces. Having a stray space can be confusing, as it prevents the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. On the first line, type a number of spaces.\n3. Insert a tab character.\n4. Type some text.\n5. Insert a tab character.\n6. Type some more text.\n7. Move to the second line and insert a number of spaces.\n8. Highlight both lines.\n9. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n\nNotice that nothing moves."}
