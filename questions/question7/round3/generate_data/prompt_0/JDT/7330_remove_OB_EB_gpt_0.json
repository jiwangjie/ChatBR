{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions seem to be distributed based on personal preference, which should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, without the need to switch the view.", "OB": "The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is not available when selecting text in the editor. It only becomes visible when switching to the Outline view.", "EB": "When selecting text in the editor, the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be easily accessible. Users should not need to switch to the Outline view to find this action.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the editor. \n2. Select some text. \n3. Navigate to the Edit menu or context menu and observe the available actions. The 'Add Javadoc Comment' action should be missing from both menus."}
