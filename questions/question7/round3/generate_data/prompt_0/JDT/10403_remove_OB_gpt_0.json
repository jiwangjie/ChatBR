{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new project\n2. Specify an existing directory structure\n3. Specify the output folder as a bin directory that contains more than just .class files\n4. Attempt to delete the output directory\n5. Verify if the directory is successfully deleted and rebuilt."}
