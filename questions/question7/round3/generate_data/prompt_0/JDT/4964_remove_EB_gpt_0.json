The code assist list is up with two items: 'DISPOSED' and 'intWidgetdispose()voidWidget'. When the user types '(', the automatic code assist inserts the selected item from the list instead of 'dispose()' as desired.", "OB": "Build 204: The automatic code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()' when the user types '(' after 'button.dispose'.", "EB": "Code assist should notice that the user typed '('. It should prioritize 'dispose()' as a better match instead of 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, it should be case sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "SR": "Build 204: To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the SWT code editor.\n2. Type 'button.dispose'.\n3. Without looking at the code assist list, type '('.\n4. Observe that 'DISPOSED' is inserted instead of 'dispose()'. "}
