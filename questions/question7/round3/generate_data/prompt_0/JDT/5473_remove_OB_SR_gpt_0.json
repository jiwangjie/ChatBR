{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the ShiftLeft function is executed on text with intermixed tabs and spaces, the behavior is confusing and inconsistent. In the first scenario, when there is a tab character at the beginning of the first line and spaces for indentation in the second line, executing ShiftLeft does not produce the expected result.", "EB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually. Then, executing ShiftLeft should shift the first line left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). The second line should also be shifted left. It is important to make sure that stray spaces do not interfere with the shifting process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a text with a tab character at the beginning of the first line and spaces for indentation in the second line. 2. Execute the ShiftLeft function on the text. Observe the unexpected behavior and confusion caused by the shifting process."}
