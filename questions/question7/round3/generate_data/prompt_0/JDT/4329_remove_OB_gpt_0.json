This issue is only observed when searching for declarations. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works as expected.", "EB": "When searching via Package view selection and dialog for declarations, relevant search results should be displayed. The search functionality should be consistent between Package view selection and dialog and the context menu in the packages view.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Package view in the software.\n2. Perform a search using the search dialog within the Package view selection and dialog.\n3. Observe that no search results are displayed for declarations.\n\nNote: When searching, the software should first attempt to retrieve the Java element. If retrieval fails, it should display the element name rather than the fully qualified name."}
