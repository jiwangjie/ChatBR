Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The software should either honor the cancellation request and stop the process of adding the exception breakpoint, or disable the cancel button when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run and pass false for the cancelable parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Start the process of adding an exception breakpoint. 2) Click the cancel button to cancel the process. 3) Observe that the progress dialog closes immediately and the exception list still comes up."}
