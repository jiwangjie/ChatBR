The issue arises when setting the output location and classpath as two separate operations, which results in an illegal state.", "EB": "In order to avoid this issue, the setting of classpath and output location should be offered as one operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug, follow these steps: 1. Set the output location and classpath separately. 2. Press 'Ok'. 3. Observe the error message stating 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'."}
