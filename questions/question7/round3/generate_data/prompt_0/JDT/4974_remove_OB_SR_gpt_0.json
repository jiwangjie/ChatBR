{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, setting the classpath and output location in the software requires two separate operations. When attempting to set the classpath or output location individually, the system displays a strange error message. It should say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that setting the classpath and output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location at once. Additionally, the error message should be improved to display the correct information.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Navigate to the settings or preferences menu.\n3. Look for options related to setting the classpath or output location.\n4. Attempt to set the classpath or output location individually and observe the error message.\n5. Note that the error message incorrectly states that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'."}
