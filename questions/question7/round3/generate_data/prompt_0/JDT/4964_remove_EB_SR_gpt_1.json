{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: `button.DISPOSED` which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a `(` and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code in build 204, when I type the following: `button.dispose`, the automatic code assist list pops up with two items: `DISPOSED` and `dispose()`.", "EB": "When I type `button.dispose()` and press enter, the code assist should recognize that I have typed a `(` and that it matches \"dispose()\" better than \"DISPOSED\". The automatic code assist should insert the correct method name without any confusion.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing `button.dispose`.\n3. Notice that the automatic code assist list pops up with the options `DISPOSED` and `dispose()`.\n4. Type `(` immediately after `dispose`.\n5. Observe that the automatic code assist inserts the selected item instead of recognizing the match between the typing and the available options."}
