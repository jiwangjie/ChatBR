{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The progress dialog should stay open when adding an exception breakpoint. It should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. When calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancellable parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the exception breakpoint dialog.\n2. Click on the 'Add' button.\n3. The progress dialog should appear.\n4. Attempt to cancel the operation by clicking the cancel button.\n5. Observe that the progress dialog closes immediately and the exception list still comes up."}
