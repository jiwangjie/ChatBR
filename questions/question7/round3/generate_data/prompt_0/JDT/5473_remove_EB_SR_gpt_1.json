It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left, at least up to the first space character (i.e., removing the tab). Additionally, if there is a stray space, it is confusing because it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that executing the ShiftLeft function should shift the second line left and the first line left, at least up to the first space character (if a tab is replaced with spaces). Any stray spaces should not affect the shift operation.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces, ensuring that the two lines are visually indented the same.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft function and observe the movement of the text. Make sure to note any stray spaces that may be present."}
