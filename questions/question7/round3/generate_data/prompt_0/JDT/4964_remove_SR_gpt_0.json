{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code and typing 'button.dispose(', the automatic code assist inserts 'button.DISPOSED' instead of 'button.dispose();'.", "EB": "The automatic code assist should recognize that 'button.dispose(' matches 'dispose()' better than 'DISPOSED' and should insert 'button.dispose();' instead.", "SR": "1. Open the SWT code editor.\n2. Type 'button.dispose('.\n3. Observe the automatic code assist list.\n4. Note that 'button.DISPOSED' is inserted instead of 'button.dispose();'."}
