{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the project properties, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, creating an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "The software should allow setting the classpath and output location as one operation, instead of treating them as separate operations that can cause conflicts.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
