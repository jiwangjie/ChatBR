I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. It seems that currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste, and this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the current view. It is unclear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. Users are required to switch views to access certain actions.", "EB": "I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available in the Edit (or some other global) menu. All actions should be reachable from the editor, and it should not be necessary for users to switch views to access certain actions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Open the editor and select a portion of text. \n2. Check the context menu and the Edit (or some other global) menu for the action 'Add Javadoc Comment'."}
