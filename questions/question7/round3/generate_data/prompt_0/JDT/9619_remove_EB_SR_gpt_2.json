Open the dialog for moving a static member.\n2. Observe that the browse button is too small.\n3. Proceed to the next page and observe that the title says 'Type not found'.\n4. Check that types from other projects or folders are shown in the dialog.\n5. Attempt to move the static member to the same type and check if the refactoring warning appears and pseudo-changes are made in all referencing classes."}
