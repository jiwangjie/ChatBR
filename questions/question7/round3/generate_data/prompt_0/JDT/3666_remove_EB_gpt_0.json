{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Hungry code assist eating too much code", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature is eating too much code. The following class demonstrates the issue:\n\npublic class X {\nvoid bar(X x) {\nbaz(x.foo());\n}\n\nint foo() {\nreturn 5;\n}\n\nvoid baz(int i, int j) {\n}\n}\n\nTo make the program correct, a parameter needs to be added to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method. The expected behavior is that the code assist should not eat the code when providing suggestions.", "OB": "The code is changed to: baz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would rather it gave me: baz(x.foo()x.foo())", "EB": "The code assist feature should provide suggestions without eating the code. Specifically, it should not remove the code after the first 'x.' when suggesting 'foo()' for 'baz' call in 'bar' method.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Change the 'baz' call to: baz(x.x.foo())\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up the code assist\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list\n5. Select 'foo()'"}
