Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, and then ShiftLeft is executed, the text does not move as expected. It is not clear how this behavior is specified, but in this scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (eliminating the tab). The presence of a stray space makes it even more confusing as to why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a default text editor. 2. Type in the following: <space><tab>some text<tab>some text2. 3. Highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft. Notice that nothing moves."}
