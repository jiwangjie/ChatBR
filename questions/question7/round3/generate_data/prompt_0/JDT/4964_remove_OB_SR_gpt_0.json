{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the code assist feature, if a token such as 'DISPOSED' is selected, it is automatically inserted into the code even if it does not match the desired function or method.", "EB": "The code assist feature should be smarter and more context-aware. It should recognize that when a '(' is typed, it is more likely that the user is intending to type a function or method name that matches the input, rather than inserting a pre-defined token from the list. Alternatively, the code assist feature could be made case sensitive to ensure more accurate suggestions.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the code editor.\n2. Begin typing a method or function name that starts with a letter in lowercase.\n3. Invoke the code assist feature by pressing a specific key combination or using a mouse gesture.\n4. Select a token from the suggestion list that does not match the desired method or function.\n5. Observe that the incorrect token is automatically inserted into the code."}
