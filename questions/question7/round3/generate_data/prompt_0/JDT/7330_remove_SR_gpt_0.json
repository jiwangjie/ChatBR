Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste, but it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, and it is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "I expected the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action to be available in the context menu.", "SR": "To reproduce, follow these steps:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select text.\n3. Right-click to open the context menu and observe that the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action is not listed."}
