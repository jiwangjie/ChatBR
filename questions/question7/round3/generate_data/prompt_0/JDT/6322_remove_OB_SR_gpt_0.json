{"id": "6322", "title": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes", "description": "Bug 6322: All types dialog shows obfuscated classes. JDK 1.4 includes obfuscated classes (a, a1, b, c, d) etc.", "OB": "The All types dialog in the software displays obfuscated class names such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc. These class names are not easily readable or understandable.", "EB": "The All types dialog should display obfuscated classes with less prominence. This could be achieved by dimming the obfuscated class names, using different styling or visual cues, or placing them in a separate section.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, launch the software and open the All types dialog. Observe that the dialog displays obfuscated class names (such as 'a', 'a1', 'b', 'c', 'd') in their current prominent form."}
