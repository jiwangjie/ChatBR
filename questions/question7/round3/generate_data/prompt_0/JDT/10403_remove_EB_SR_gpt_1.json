{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The software should provide a confirmation message when a user creates a new project and selects an existing directory as the output folder. The confirmation message should inform the user that the selected bin directory will be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project.\n2. Select an existing directory as the output folder.\n3. Verify that the software displays a confirmation message stating that the selected bin directory will be deleted and rebuilt."}
