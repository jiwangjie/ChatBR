{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the automatic Code Assist feature, the suggested completion option 'DISPOSED' is selected instead of 'dispose()' when typing 'button.dispose'.", "EB": "The Code Assist feature should prioritize the suggested completion 'dispose()' over 'DISPOSED' when it detects that the user has typed a '(' character.", "SR": "1. Open Build 204.\n2. Start writing SWT code.\n3. Type 'button.dispose' without paying attention to the Code Assist list.\n4. Observe that the suggested completion 'DISPOSED' is automatically inserted instead of 'dispose()'. "}
