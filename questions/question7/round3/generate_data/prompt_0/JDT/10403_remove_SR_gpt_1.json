{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When creating a new project, there should be a confirmation that the bin directory is deletable and can be rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Set the output folder to a bin directory that contains files other than .class files. \n3. Check if there is a confirmation message ensuring that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
