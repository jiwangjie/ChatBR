However, the exception list still appears, and the cancellation request is ignored.", "EB": "The progress dialog should either honor the cancellation request and not display the exception list, or disable the cancel button when calling the ProgressMonitorDialog.run method by passing 'false' for the 'cancelable' parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. \n2) Click the J! button to add an exception. \n3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
