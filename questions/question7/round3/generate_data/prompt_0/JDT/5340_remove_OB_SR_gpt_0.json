Eventually, the exception list appears, ignoring the cancellation request.", "EB": "The progress dialog should not close immediately when cancelling the operation. It should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. When calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, false should be passed for the 'cancellable' parameter.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the exception breakpoint dialog.\n2. Add an exception breakpoint.\n3. Click on the cancel button during the progress dialog."}
