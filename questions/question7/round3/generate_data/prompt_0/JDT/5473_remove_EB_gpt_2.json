", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text as expected. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). Additionally, if there is a stray space, it is confusing as there is no indication why the text won't shift.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when executing ShiftLeft, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character or remove the preceding tab. The behavior should not be affected by any stray space.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. In a default text editor, type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n2. Now highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.\n   Notice that nothing moves."}
