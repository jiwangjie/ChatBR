I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view in the Edit (or some other global) menu. I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not (not all need to be in the context menu, but all must be reachable from the editor, e.g., it is not acceptable to force users to switch the view).", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "All actions should be available in the context menu or the Edit menu.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the software and select some text.\n2. Check the context menu and verify if the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is available. If not, switch to the Outline view and confirm if the action is accessible."}
