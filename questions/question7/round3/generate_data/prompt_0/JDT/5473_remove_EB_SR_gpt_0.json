However, executing the ShiftLeft command causes the text to move. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but it seems that in the given scenario, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left to at least the space character (i.e., removing the tab). It is also confusing when there is a stray space, as the user doesn't know why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces until the two lines are visually indented the same.\n2. Execute the ShiftLeft command and observe the text movement."}
