This message is unclear and raises questions about its meaning and whether it indicates an error. There are also discussions about whether this message should be displayed in red with an error icon.", "EB": "The New Package Wizard should not display any warning or error message when the package name field is empty, and the 'Finish' button should be disabled in this case.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new Java Project. \n2. Select the created project. \n3. Open the New Java Package wizard."}
