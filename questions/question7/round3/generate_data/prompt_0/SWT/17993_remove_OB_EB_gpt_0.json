{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The software should not automatically replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow the user to enter their desired text freely.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the 'Find/Replace' dialog through the 'Edit' menu. 2. In the 'Find' field, type 'a'. 3. Click 'Find'. 4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field and observe that it is automatically replaced with the previous value from the history."}
