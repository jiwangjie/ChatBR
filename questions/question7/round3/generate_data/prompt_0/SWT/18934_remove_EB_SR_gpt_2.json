{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, with GTK2 and KDE 2.2.10 (GTK2 only), it is observed that the scrollbars are enabled. However, when attempting to move them, they do not have any effect. This behavior is misleading, especially when opening a small image such as an icon, as the scrollbars are not functional.", "OB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example are enabled, but do not have any effect when attempting to move them. This behavior is misleading, as they appear to be interactive but do not actually serve any purpose.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that in the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars should be disabled, as they do not serve any functional purpose. This will prevent confusion and provide a better user experience.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled.\n3. Attempt to move the scrollbars and observe that they do not have any effect. This can be demonstrated using a small image, such as an icon."}
