This error is not defined in the CLDC class libraries.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code in org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil should be modified to remove the reflection and avoid the NoClassDefFoundError. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Verify or use jxeLink or a similar approach.\n2. Compile the code using the Eclipse compiler or Sun's compiler.\n3. Observe that the compiler does not generate an error, but the NoClassDefFoundError is encountered at runtime in the CLDC version of SWT.\n\nTo resolve the issue, change the line mentioned above to:\nstatic Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);\nNote: This change has not been tested, but it should provide the same functionality."}
