Open a Java file in the editor.\n2. Make some changes to the file.\n3. Attempt to revert the changes using the 'Revert' option.\n4. Observe the time it takes to complete the revert operation.\n5. Close the file and reopen it.\n6. Compare the time taken to close and reopen the file with the time taken to revert the changes."}
