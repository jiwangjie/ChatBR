However, when selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor after marking the file dirty, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.", "EB": "The performance of the 'Revert' operation should be faster, taking a similar amount of time as the 'close and reopen' approach.", "SR": "1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. 2) Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty. 3) Click on the close box in the editor tab and answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. 4) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. 5) Repeat steps 1 and 2 and select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor."}
