{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when clicking anywhere in the tree, regardless of the operating system. The text widget should not remain focused when interacting with the tree.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Click anywhere in the tree. 2. Observe that the tree gets focus and the text widget remains focused on Linux."}
