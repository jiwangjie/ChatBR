{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to \"autocomplete\" which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full \"autocomplete\" feature could be provided.", "OB": "When performing a Find/Replace operation, the typed entry is being replaced with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers.", "EB": "The behavior should be changed so that the typed entry is not replaced with a value from the history. Instead, the feature should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Alternatively, the feature could be removed until a more user-friendly implementation is available.", "SR": "1. Open a document so that Edit -> Find/Replace... becomes available.\n2. Enter a search term in the Find field.\n3. Check that the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Repeat the above steps for the Replace With field, ensuring that the behavior is consistent."}
