However, if I repeat steps 1) and 2) and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes around 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file.", "EB": "I expect the 'Revert' action to replace the contents of the window with the original file as quickly as the 'close and reopen' action does.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. 2. Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. 3. Repeat steps 1) and 2). 4. Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor. Note the time it takes to replace the contents of the window with the original file."}
