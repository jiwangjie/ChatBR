{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The text widget should lose focus when the user clicks on the tree, regardless of the operating system. This will resolve platform UI bug 2470.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the application containing the tree widget and the text widget. \n2. Click anywhere in the tree. \n3. Observe that the tree gains focus, but the text widget does not lose focus."}
