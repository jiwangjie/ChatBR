{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to \"autocomplete\", which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full \"autocomplete\" feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the Find or Replace fields, the software automatically suggests entries from previous searches, replacing the user's typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "The behavior of Find/Replace should be changed to respect the case of what the user types. The software should allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed without automatically suggesting entries from the history. The Find/Replace feature should not interfere with the user's input.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document so that Edit > Find/Replace... becomes available.\n2. Click on Edit > Find/Replace....\n3. In the Find field, type 'a'.\n4. Click 'Find'.\n5. Try to type 'A' into the Find field.\n6. Observe that the typed 'A' is replaced with a suggested entry from the history."}
