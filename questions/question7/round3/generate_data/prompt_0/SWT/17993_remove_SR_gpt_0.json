{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete,' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "The behavior of Find/Replace should be changed to something more simple that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: Open a document so that Edit -> Find/Replace... becomes available. Enter some text in the 'Find' field and observe if it gets replaced with a value from the history. The behavior is similar for the 'Replace With' field."}
