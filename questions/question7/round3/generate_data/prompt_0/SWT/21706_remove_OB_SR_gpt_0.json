Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, making the constructor private would prevent unnecessary instantiation. This change would not increase the size of the class, as the compiler automatically adds a public constructor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BidiUtil class in the win32 platform.\n2. Look for any usage of the Class.forName() method."}
