{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree receives focus. However, on Linux, the text widget never loses focus when you click on the tree. It is important to note that the text widget is a child of the tree. This behavior causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When running the attached code using build 20020920, the left tree and text should behave as expected on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the attached code in the specified build. 2. Click anywhere in the tree widget. Observe that the tree widget retains focus and the text widget does not lose focus on Linux."}
