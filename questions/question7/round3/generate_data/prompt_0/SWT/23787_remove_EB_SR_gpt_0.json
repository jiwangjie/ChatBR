{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "Integration build 09/17. The Project Properties Info page in the Properties dialog should not use text fields. It looks fine on Windows, but on motif platforms, these text fields get automatic borders, which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more. This issue affects the appearance of the page and needs to be addressed.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page of the Properties dialog have automatic borders, indicating they are user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields. The fields should have consistent appearance and not display automatic borders or different colored backgrounds.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the Properties dialog for a project.\n2. Navigate to the Info page.\n3. Observe the appearance of the text fields on motif platforms such as Solaris/AIX/HPUX."}
