{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the attached code in build 20020920, the text widget with a Tree parent does not lose focus on Windows. However, the left tree and text behave as expected on both Windows and Linux.", "EB": "When running the attached code, the text widget with a Tree parent should lose focus properly on Windows, similar to how the left tree and text perform on both Windows and Linux in the current build.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run the attached code in build 20020920. \n2. Observe that the right tree and text do not lose focus on Windows. \n3. Compare this with the left tree and text, which behave correctly on both Windows and Linux."}
