{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "On Windows, when clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree does not lose focus.", "EB": "In build 20020920, the left tree and text behave as expected on both Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, click anywhere in the tree and observe that the tree does not lose focus."}
