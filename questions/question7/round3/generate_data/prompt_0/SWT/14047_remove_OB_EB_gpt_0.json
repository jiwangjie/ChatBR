{"id": "14047", "title": "Bug 14047StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap", "description": "", "OB": "The redrawing process in StyledText is inefficient when there is a text change with word wrap. It causes unnecessary redraws and impacts the performance of the application. This can be observed when performing actions that involve changing the text content.", "EB": "The redrawing process in StyledText should be optimized to minimize unnecessary redraws during text changes with word wrap. This will improve the overall performance of the application.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue and observe the inefficient redraws, follow these steps:\n1. Add the following line to StyledText performPaint method:\n   System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);\n2. Perform actions that involve changing the text content with word wrap enabled.\n3. Monitor the console output to observe the excessive redraws occurring."}
