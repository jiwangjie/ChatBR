I need to first click on one of the 'live' areas before it starts working (e.g., the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame, or the content frame).", "OB": "The Help view does not start in a state where it can be immediately navigated via the keyboard. Users have to click on one of the 'live' areas before it becomes functional with keyboard navigation.", "EB": "We should start the Help view in a way that can be immediately navigated via the keyboard.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: Open the Help view and try to navigate using only the keyboard.
