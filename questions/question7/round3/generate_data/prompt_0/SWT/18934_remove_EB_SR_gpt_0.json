{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled. However, it is observed that the scrollbars can be moved around, but they do not have any effect. This behavior is misleading, especially when opening a small image such as an icon, as the scrollbars do not perform any actual scrolling.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example. 2. Observe the scrollbars being enabled but non-functional. 3. Open a small image, such as an icon, and note that the scrollbars do not perform any scroll activity."}
