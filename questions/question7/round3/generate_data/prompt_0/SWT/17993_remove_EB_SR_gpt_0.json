{"id": "17993", "title": "Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. Currently, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous search entry is found in the history, it automatically replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete but causes issues in performing find or replace operations. It is suggested to change this behavior to prevent the replacement of typed entries.", "OB": "In the Find/Replace dialog, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous search entry is found in the history, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "The Find/Replace dialog should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. Instead, it should allow users to manually enter their desired search or replacement terms.", "SR": "1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by selecting 'Edit' > 'Find/Replace...'\n2. Type a search term or replacement term in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' field.\n3. Observe if the entered term is replaced with a value from the history."}
