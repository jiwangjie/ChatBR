It should be as fast as the close and reopen operations.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Open an editor on the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository. 2) Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty. 3) Click on the close box in the editor tab and answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog. 4) Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. 5) Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor. Note the significant delay (15 seconds) in replacing the window's contents with the original."}
