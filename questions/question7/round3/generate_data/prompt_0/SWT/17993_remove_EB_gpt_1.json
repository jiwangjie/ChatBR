{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a matching entry from the history is found, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. However, this behavior often makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a matching entry from the history is found, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, so the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history. The system should allow users to freely type in their desired search or replacement strings without interference.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by choosing Edit > Find/Replace... 2. Type something into the 'Find' field. 3. Observe if the typed entry is replaced with a value from the history."}
