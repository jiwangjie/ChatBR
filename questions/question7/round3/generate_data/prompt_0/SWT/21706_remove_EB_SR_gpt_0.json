When the method is called, it throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This issue is only visible when verifying or using jxeLink or similar tools. The Eclipse compiler and Sun's compiler do not produce a compiler error for this.", "EB": "The usage of Class.forName(\"org...BidiUtil\") in the BidiUtil class in the win32 version should be modified to avoid the NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT. The simplest way to resolve this issue is to remove the reflection usage from the code.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class in the win32 version.\n2. Locate the line: static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);\n3. Verify or use jxeLink or a similar tool to observe the NoClassDefFoundError exception thrown by the method."}
