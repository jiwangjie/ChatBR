The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This includes several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, even with the schema filter, a warning message is displayed on load because the tree is being populated entirely on load.", "EB": "Instead, the load of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": ""}
