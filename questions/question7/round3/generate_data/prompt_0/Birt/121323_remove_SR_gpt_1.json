{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can cause various issues.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information along with the column mapping. Instead of stripping off the selection from the XPath expression, the plain XPath expression (prepended with the path from the data set selector itself) should be used, allowing filtering to be optional based on user needs.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. \n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'. \n3. Observe that the selection gets stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. \n4. Leave the dialog and check the .rptdesign file to confirm that the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
