The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "Currently, the JDBC Data Set Editor loads all tables and columns in the data source when the page is opened.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should only load tables and columns when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "To reproduce:  \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.  \n2. Observe that all tables and columns are loaded and displayed in the tree control.  \n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter.  \n4. Verify that the tables and columns are loaded on demand and dynamically displayed based on user actions."}
