{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. If an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] is entered for the column mapping, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. It is important to note that treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n 2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] for the column mapping.\n 3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n 4. Leave the dialog.\n 5. Check the .rptdesign file and verify that the RelationInformation is persisted, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost."}
