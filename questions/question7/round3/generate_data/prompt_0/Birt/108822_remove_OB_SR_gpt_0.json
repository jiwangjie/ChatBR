{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822: More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border values for row value", "description": "The current logic for processing disk sorting when there is a border value for the row value can be improved.", "OB": "The current logic for disk sorting with border values for row value is not efficient and does not provide accurate results.", "EB": "A more efficient logic should be implemented to handle disk sorting with border values for the row value. Instead of directly writing the data to the file, the data should be sorted in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, copy the file to the destination folder and observe the incorrect sorting behavior. Additionally, perform operations that involve border values for the row value and note the inaccurate results."}
