{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "The bug report seeks to address the issue where the BIRT designer stores absolute paths instead of relative paths when including a library in a report design.", "OB": "Currently, I see that the report design is storing the absolute path of the library. For example, <property name=\"fileName\">/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>. This behavior needs to be changed to store the relative path.", "EB": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path. When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For instance, if the report design is saved at $project/test, the relative path should be saved as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create a new report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design in a specific location.\n5. Check the property <property name=\"fileName\"> for the included library, and ensure that it stores the relative path rather than the absolute path."}
