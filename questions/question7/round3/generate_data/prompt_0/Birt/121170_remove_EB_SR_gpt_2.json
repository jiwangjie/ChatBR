However, after extraction, recognizable strings are returned as labels.", "EB": "The 'get column label' function should return user recognizable strings as labels both before and after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a metadata object.\n2. Call the 'get column label' function on the metadata object before extraction.\n3. Note that null values are returned as labels.\n4. Extract the metadata.\n5.
