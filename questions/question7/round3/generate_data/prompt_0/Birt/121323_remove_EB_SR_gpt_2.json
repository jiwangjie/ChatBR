{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not persisting filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped and stored in the 'filterInfo' HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in 'filterInfo' is lost. This behavior is problematic as XPath expressions should not be treated in this way.", "EB": "Expected: The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist filter information entered by user. The data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be correctly saved to the design file.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped and stored in the 'filterInfo' HashMap.\n4. Leave the dialog.\n5. Check if the data stored in 'filterInfo' is lost."}
