{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a significant amount of time. Eventually, a message appears saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The load process for the tree in the data set editor should be deferred and only triggered when the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This will improve the user experience by reducing wait time and unnecessary querying of the entire schema.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the data set editor. \n2. Notice the long wait time while the entire schema is being queried. \n3. Eventually, see the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. \n\nPlease see bug #101372 for a related request to filter based on the schema."}
