Currently, the program does the following operation:", "EB": "To improve efficiency, the program should support a better logic for processing disk sorting when there are border values for row numbers. One solution could be sorting the data directly in memory and then writing it to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process less than 40000 rows. Observe the sorting operation."}
