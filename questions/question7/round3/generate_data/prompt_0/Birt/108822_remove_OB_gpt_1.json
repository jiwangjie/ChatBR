{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient disk sorting logic needed for border row values", "description": "", "OB": "", "EB": "More efficient logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is a border value for the row. Instead of saving the file as a temp file and calling it to memory, the data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk. 2. Set the program to process data that is less than 40000. 3. Perform the following operations: a. Save the file as a temp file. b. Call the file to memory. c. Sort the data. d. Save the file as a temp file again."}
