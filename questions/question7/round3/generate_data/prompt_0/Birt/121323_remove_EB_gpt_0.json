{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, such as 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation class gets persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Open the .rptdesign file and check if the filter information is still present in the filterInfo HashMap."}
