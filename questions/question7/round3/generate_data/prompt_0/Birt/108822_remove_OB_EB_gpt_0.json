{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient logic needed for disk sorting with border values in rows", "description": "", "OB": "When sorting data on disk, if there are 40000 rows and the program is set to process data less than 40000, the current logic performs the following operations:\n1. Saves the file as a temporary file.\n2. Calls the file into memory.\n3. Sorts the data.\n4. Saves the file to a temporary file.", "EB": "A more efficient logic should be implemented for sorting data on disk with border values in rows. This logic should optimize the processing steps involved in saving, loading, and sorting the data.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set the program to sort data on disk.\n2. Prepare a dataset with 40000 rows.\n3. Configure the program to process data less than 40000.\n4. Perform the sorting operation.\n5. Observe the performance and processing steps."}
