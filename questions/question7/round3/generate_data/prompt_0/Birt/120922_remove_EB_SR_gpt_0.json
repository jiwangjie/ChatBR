The user is then prompted with a dialog that asks if they want to save, discard, or cancel their changes. The dialog is titled \"Error\". The problem with this behavior is that it is unclear to the user how to save or discard the changes, and the error message is not informative enough. The error message displayed is: \"Source page is dirty.\"", "OB": "When trying to switch from the XML source view to the Layout view in the Layout Editor, an error message is shown stating that the changes made in the source view need to be saved. The user is then presented with a dialog titled \"Error\", which provides options to save the changes, discard them, or cancel the action.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the user tries to switch from the XML source view to the Layout view in the Layout Editor, they should be able to do so without any error message or prompt about saving or discarding changes. The user should be able to seamlessly switch between views.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer layout.\n2. Edit the XML in the source view.\n3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view.\n4.
