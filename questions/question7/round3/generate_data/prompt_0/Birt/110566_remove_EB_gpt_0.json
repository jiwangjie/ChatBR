As per the developer, row[0] can only be generated after all the data is fetched and cannot be used as a filter expression.", "OB": "When attempting to set a filter in the data set with the expression 'row[0] equals to', the first result record is incorrectly returned during preview.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that row[0] cannot be used as a filter expression.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Set a filter in the data set with the expression 'row[0] equals to' \n2. Click on the Preview tab and observe the incorrect result returned."}
