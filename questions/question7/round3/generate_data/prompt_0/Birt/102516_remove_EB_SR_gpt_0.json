The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, however, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor is populated on load, causing a warning message to appear. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being loaded on initial page load.", "EB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, instead of loading them all on page load. This will prevent the warning message from appearing and improve performance.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query. 2. Use the code from CVS dated 6/30/05. 3. Load the page on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers. 4. Observe the warning message and the excessive number of tables being loaded."}
