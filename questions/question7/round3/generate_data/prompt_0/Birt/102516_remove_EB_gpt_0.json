{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand\n\nThe JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter; however, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.\n\nWhen the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried, and eventually get the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.\n", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system even if there are several hundred tables.
