{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information entered in the XPath expression for the column mapping is lost. Data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is not persisted to the .rptdesign file.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information entered by the user, so that it is not lost when leaving the dialog. The data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be correctly saved to the .rptdesign file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, including a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Provide some filter information in the dialog.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n\nExpected behavior: The filter information entered in step 3 should still be present in the dialog.\n\nObserved behavior: The filter information is lost and not persisted."}
