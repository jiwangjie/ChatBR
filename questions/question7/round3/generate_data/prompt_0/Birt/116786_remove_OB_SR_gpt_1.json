{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer currently generates and saves an absolute path instead of a relative path. This causes issues when the report design is stored in a different location than originally set up.", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test, the included library path should be stored relative to that location.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design.\n3. Include a library in the report design.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Verify that the included library path is stored as an absolute path instead of a relative path."}
