Instead, it returns some internal or technical labels that are not understandable to the user.", "EB": "The 'get column label' function should return user recognizable labels that can be displayed to the end user. These labels should be the same before and after the data extraction process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Obtain a meta data object.\n2. Call the 'get column label' function using the meta data object.\n3. Verify that the returned label is not user recognizable."}
