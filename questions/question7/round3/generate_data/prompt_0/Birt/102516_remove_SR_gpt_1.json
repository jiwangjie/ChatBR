The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. The current code (from CVS dated 6/30/05) includes a schema filter, but it still generates a warning message on load because the tree is being populated immediately.", "OB": "The tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers shows every schema (catalog) on the system, including several hundred tables. Despite the presence of a schema filter, a warning message is displayed on loading the page because the tree is being populated immediately.", "EB": "The tree loading process should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Observe that the tree control immediately shows every schema on the system, including several hundred tables.\n3. Apply a schema filter or expand the tree to see if the loading process is deferred."}
