{"id": "108822", "title": "Bug 108822 - More efficient sorting logic needed for processing disk sorting with border values for row value", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for processing disk sorting with border values for row value in the program is inefficient.", "EB": "A more efficient logic is expected to be implemented to process disk sorting when there are border values for row values. The data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort 40000 rows of data on disk.\n2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000.\n3. Save the file as a temporary file.\n4. Load the file into memory.\n5. Sort the data.\n6. Save the sorted data to the temporary file."}
