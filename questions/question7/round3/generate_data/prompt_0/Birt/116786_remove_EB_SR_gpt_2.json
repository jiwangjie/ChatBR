{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "The current implementation of the report design saves the absolute path for library includes. This should be updated to save the relative path instead.", "OB": "The observed behavior is that the property 'fileName' in the report design file includes an absolute path: 'E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'. Also, the property 'namespace' includes the absolute path in the value.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the property 'fileName' and 'namespace' in the report design file should store the relative path instead of the absolute path.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design file.\n2. Look for the property 'fileName' and 'namespace' that includes a library.\n3. Verify that the path mentioned in these properties is absolute instead of relative."}
