The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the error message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The data set editor should load tables and columns on demand so that the entire schema is not queried at once and the error message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is not shown.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the time it takes to load the entire schema and the appearance of the error message."}
