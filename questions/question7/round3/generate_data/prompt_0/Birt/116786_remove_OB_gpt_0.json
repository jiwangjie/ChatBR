{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer does not generate or save the relative path.", "EB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path for the library. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test, and a library is included from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be stored.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open BIRT designer.\n2. Open a report design located in $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Check the stored path for the included library and verify if it is saved as a relative path."}
