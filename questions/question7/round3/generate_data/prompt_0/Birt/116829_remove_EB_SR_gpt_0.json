The label height remains the same even after setting a new font size in the UI.", "EB": "Expect the label height to automatically adjust and reflect the new font size when it is modified in the UI.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the UI where the label is displayed. \n2. Modify the font size of the label. \n3. Observe that the height of the label does not change to accommodate the new font size."}
