", "OB": "The current behavior of the dialog is not mentioned in the bug report.", "EB": "I would suggest using the title 'Move static field(s)' instead of 'Move static member'. Additionally, I would utilize the description section to explain that the user should be able to select 'x' number of fields from 'xx' and move them. The selection dialog should also be initialized with the type currently entered.", "SR": "It is unclear from the bug report how to browse and select a type from a CU in a different project. Please provide additional steps to reproduce this issue."}
