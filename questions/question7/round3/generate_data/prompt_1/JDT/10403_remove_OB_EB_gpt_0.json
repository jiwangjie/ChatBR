{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, there should be a confirmation to check if the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Currently, some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files, which can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "Currently, when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder to a bin directory, there is no confirmation or check if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "After creating a new project, there should be a confirmation or check to ensure that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt if necessary.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Point the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n3.
