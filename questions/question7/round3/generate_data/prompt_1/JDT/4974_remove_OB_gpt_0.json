{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the setting of classpath and output location is not offered as one operation.", "EB": "The setting of classpath and output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process that checks both classpath and output location at once. Additionally, the error message when trying to nest '/xy/src' in '/xy' seems strange. It should be clarified to say that '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
