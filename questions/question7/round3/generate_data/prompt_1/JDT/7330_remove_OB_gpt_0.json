{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "When I was working on the project, I encountered an issue where I was unable to find the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action when selecting text. I realized that the action was only available in the Outline view, not in the Edit menu or any other global menu. It seems that the distribution of actions is based on personal taste rather than a consistent approach. This can be confusing for users as it is not clear why some actions are in the context menu while others are not. It is important to make sure that all actions are reachable from the editor, without requiring users to switch views.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' was not available when selecting text.", "EB": "I expected the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action to be available in the Edit menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the editor and select some text.\n2. Right-click on the selected text.\n3. Look for the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action in the context menu.\n4. Alternatively, navigate to the Edit menu and check if the action is available there."}
