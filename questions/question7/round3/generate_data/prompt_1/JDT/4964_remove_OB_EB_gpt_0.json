Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose' and the code assist list is up, the selected suggestion is 'DISPOSED'.", "EB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose()', the code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Open the IDE and start writing SWT code.\n2. Type 'button.dispose' and observe the code assist list.\n3. Select the suggestion 'DISPOSED'.\n4. Continue typing and observe that the suggestion is not what was expected.\n5. Delete the inserted code and start typing 'button.dispose()'.\n6. Observe the code assist suggestions."}
