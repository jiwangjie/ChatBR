Eventually, the exception list comes up despite the cancellation request. The cancellation request should be honored, causing the process to either stop or disable the cancel button. To achieve this, pass 'false' for the 'cancellable' parameter when calling 'ProgressMonitorDialog.run'.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
