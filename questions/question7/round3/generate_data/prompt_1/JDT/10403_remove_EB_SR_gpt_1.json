{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder to a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder to a bin directory, the system should confirm that the bin directory can be deleted. If the bin directory contains files other than .class files, the system should display an error message and prompt the user to choose a different output folder. This ensures that the output folder only contains .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "SR": "1. Open the project creation interface.\n2. Select an existing directory structure.\n3. Choose a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Click on the 'Create Project' button.\n5. Observe the confirmation message or error message regarding the ability to delete the bin directory.\n6. If an error message is displayed, attempt to select a different output folder and repeat steps 4-5."}
