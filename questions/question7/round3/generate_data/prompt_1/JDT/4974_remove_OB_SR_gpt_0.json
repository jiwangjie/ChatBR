{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "The current behavior for setting the classpath and output location is not ideal. It requires two separate operations to be performed - one for setting the classpath and another for setting the output location.", "EB": "The desired behavior is to offer a single operation for setting both the classpath and output location.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to the settings menu.\n3. Try to set the classpath and output location simultaneously.\n4. Verify that the operation fails and shows a strange error message."}
