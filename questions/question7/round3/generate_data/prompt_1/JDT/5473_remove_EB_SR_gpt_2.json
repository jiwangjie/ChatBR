The behavior is confusing, as it is not clear why the text won't shift. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., the tab should be treated as a regular space). Additionally, it is hard to determine if the presence of a stray space is causing the confusion.", "EB": "", "SR": "1.
