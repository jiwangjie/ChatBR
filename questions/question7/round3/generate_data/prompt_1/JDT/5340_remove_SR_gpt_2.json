Eventually, the exception list comes up, but it ignores the cancellation request.", "EB": "When adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog should not close immediately. It should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass 'false' for the 'cancelable' parameter.", "SR": "1.
