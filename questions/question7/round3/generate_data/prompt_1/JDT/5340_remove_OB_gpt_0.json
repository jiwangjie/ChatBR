{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint through the J! button in the breakpoints pane of the debug perspective, the progress dialog does not respond to cancellation. The dialog closes immediately, but the exception is still added to the list of breakpoints.", "EB": "The progress dialog should honor the cancellation request and not add the exception breakpoint to the list. Alternatively, the cancel button should be disabled when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run by passing false for the 'cancellable' parameter.", "SR": "1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the J! button to add an exception breakpoint. 3) In the progress dialog that appears, click the cancel button."}
