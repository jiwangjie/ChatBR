{"id": "4329", "title": "No results when searching via Package view selection and dialog", "description": "The search functionality is not working properly when searching through the Package view selection and dialog. The Search dialog initializes with the fully qualified name, but no results are found when searching for declarations. However, searching via the context menu in the packages view works correctly. The expected behavior is that the search should first try to get the Java element and if that fails, it should display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "The search dialog in the Package view initializes with the fully qualified name, but no results are found when searching for declarations.", "EB": "The search should display results when searching for declarations using the Package view selection and dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the Package view. \n2. Select a package. \n3. Right-click and select 'Search' from the context menu. \n4. Enter a search query for declarations. \n5. Observe the search results."}
