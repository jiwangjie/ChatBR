{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\". Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, if DISPOSED is selected, it is inserted into the code even though it doesn't match the desired functionality.", "EB": "When using the automatic code assist feature, it should prioritize suggestions based on the context. In this case, since I typed a '(' character, it should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'. If the suggestion is not a perfect match, it should be case sensitive to avoid incorrect insertions.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor.\n2. Start typing a function call with '(' character.\n3. Observe the suggestions shown by the automatic code assist.\n4. Verify that the suggested options are contextually relevant to the typed text.\n5. Verify that the suggestions are case sensitive when automatically inserted into the code."}
