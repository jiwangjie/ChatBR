{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666: CodeCompletion - Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature in the IDE is replacing more code than expected. The following is an example class where the issue occurs:\n\npublic class X {\n  void bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo());\n  }\n\n  int foo() {\n    return 5;\n  }\n\n  void baz(int i, int j) {\n  }\n}\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an instance of X, say x.\n2. Call x.bar(x) method.\nThe code assist should replace the code 'baz(x.foo());' with 'baz(x.foo();x.foo());'. However, it is currently replacing it with 'baz(x.foo().foo());'.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nThe code assist should replace 'baz(x.foo());' with 'baz(x.foo();x.foo());'.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nThe code assist option to control the amount of source code to replace was added in a previous version but has been removed.", "OB": "The code is changed to:baz(x.foo().foo())", "EB": "The code assist should replace 'baz(x.foo());' with 'baz(x.foo();x.foo());'.", "SR": "1.
