{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces, the two lines are indented the same visually. Upon executing ShiftLeft, the text does not move. This behavior is confusing, as it is expected that at least the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left to the space character, eliminating the tab. It is also confusing if there is a stray space, as it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "Upon executing ShiftLeft after replacing the tab character with spaces, the first line should be shifted left up to the space character, and the second line should be shifted left. If there is a stray space, it should not prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   - [space]\n   - [tab]some text\n   - [tab]some text 2\n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.\n\nExpected result: The text should be shifted left."}
