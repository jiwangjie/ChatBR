The buttons are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. The first and second columns in the dialog should be merged.\n\nd. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\ne. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.", "OB": "a. The buttons in the dialog are small.\n\nb. When the dialog appears, no entry in the table is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. There is duplication in the naming validation performed on the first page of the dialog.\n\nd. The preview gets cut off when changing a parameter name to something very long.\n\ne. The dialog appears large for methods with many parameters.", "EB": "a. The buttons in the dialog should have a larger size for better visibility.\n\nb. When the dialog is opened, an entry from the table should be automatically selected.\n\nc. The naming validation should be performed only once, eliminating duplication.\n\nd. The preview in the dialog should display the entire parameter name, even if it is long.\n\ne. The dialog should have a more compact layout for methods with many parameters.", "SR": "To reproduce the issues:\n\n1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog.\n\n2. Observe that the buttons in the dialog are small.\n\n3. Check if any entry in the table is selected when the dialog appears.\n\n4. Verify that both move buttons are enabled.\n\n5. Change a parameter name to something very long and check if the preview is cut off.\n\n6. Create a method with a large number of parameters and check if the dialog appears too large."}
