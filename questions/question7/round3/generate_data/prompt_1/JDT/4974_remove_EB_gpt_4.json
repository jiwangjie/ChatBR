{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When the user presses 'Ok' after setting the output location and classpath in the project properties, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue is that the setting of output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, leading to an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Create a new project and set 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties and modify the settings to use the project itself as the source folder and the project itself as the output location."}
