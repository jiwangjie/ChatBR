{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since 'DISPOSED' is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED', which isn't even close to what I want. I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the code assist list is displayed without my notice.", "EB": "The code assist feature should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' when I type 'button.dispose'", "SR": "1. Open Build 204\n2. Start writing SWT code\n3. Type 'button.dispose' and observe the code assist suggestions"}
