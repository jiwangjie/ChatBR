It appears that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. As a result, when the output location is set first, it creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location.\n4. Press Ok to save the changes."}
