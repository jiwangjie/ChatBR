Execute ShiftLeft.\n\nThe text does not move as expected.\n\nThis behavior is confusing, as it is unclear why the text won't shift. Additionally, it is uncertain how the behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab.\n\nPresence of a stray space further adds to the confusion.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft should shift the second line left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab.\n\nThere should be no stray spaces causing confusion.", "SR": "1.
