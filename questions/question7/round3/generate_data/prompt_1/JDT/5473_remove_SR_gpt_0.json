{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473: ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Build 200110251.", "OB": "When I try to use the ShiftLeft feature on two lines of text, where the first line has a tab character and the second line has spaces for indentation, the text does not shift as expected.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, when I execute the ShiftLeft feature, the first line should be shifted left, at least until the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab), and the second line should also be shifted left. Currently, it is confusing because the text does not shift and I suspect it may be due to the presence of a stray space.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open a document with two lines, where the first line starts with a tab character and the second line starts with spaces for indentation. \n2. Place the cursor at the beginning of the first line. \n3. Use the ShiftLeft feature. \n4. Observe that the text does not shift as expected."}
