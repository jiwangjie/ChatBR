Eventually, the exception list comes up even if the cancellation request was made. The cancel button should either be disabled or the cancellation request should be honored (when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, pass false for the cancelable parameter).", "EB": "", "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open [relevant dialog or menu]\n2. Click on [relevant button or menu item] to add an exception breakpoint\n3. Wait for the progress dialog to appear\n4. Immediately cancel the operation\n5.
