The top button should be aligned with the dialog top. The table lacks a label so it can contain a mnemonic. Multiple selection should be allowed as the move up/down operation can be applied to more than one item. The signature preview is not properly wrapping. The signature preview should have its background color set to the same color as the hover.", "EB": "The marking between the button and list should be adjusted to a proper size.
