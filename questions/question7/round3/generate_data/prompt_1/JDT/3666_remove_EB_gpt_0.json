{"id": "3666", "title": "Bug 3666 - Code Completion Hungry code assist", "description": "Under certain circumstances, the code assist feature eats too much code. When calling the 'baz' method in the 'bar' method of the provided 'X' class, a parameter needs to be added to make the program correct. The steps to reproduce this issue are as follows: 1. Change the baz call to 'baz(x.x.foo())'. 2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.' 3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist. 4. Type 'f' to filter the list. 5. Select 'foo()' from the list.", "OB": "The code is changed to: baz(x.foo().foo()) and it should instead be: baz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n   void bar(X x) {\n      baz(x.foo());\n   }\n   int foo() {\n      return 5;\n   }\n   void baz(int i, int j) {\n   }\n}", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code assist will correctly suggest the 'foo()' method and update the code to 'baz(x.x.foo())'.
