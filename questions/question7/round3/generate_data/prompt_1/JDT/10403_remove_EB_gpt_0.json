Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, it is not confirmed whether the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, a confirmation should be displayed to ensure that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Create a new project.\n3. Specify an existing directory structure.\n4. Point the output folder to a bin directory that contains more than just .class files.\n5. Confirm that a message is displayed, asking if the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt.\n6. Proceed with the project creation process."}
