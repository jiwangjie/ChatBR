", "OB": "When executing ShiftLeft on lines with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text does not move.", "EB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that both lines are indented the same visually. Execute ShiftLeft. The second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). It is confusing if there is a stray space, as it prevents the expected text shift.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   <space>\n   <tab>some text\n   <tab>some text2\n3. Highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.\n4. Verify that nothing moves."}
