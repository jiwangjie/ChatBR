{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, we should confirm that the bin directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. This is necessary as some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and specifies a bin directory as the output folder, the system does not confirm if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and specifies a bin directory as the output folder, the system should confirm if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure.\n2. Specify a bin directory as the output folder.\n3. Proceed with creating the project.\n4. Observe if the system confirms if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt before proceeding further."}
