{"id": "4329", "title": "Bug 4329 - No results when searching via Package view selection and dialog (1GLDN1X)", "description": "When performing a search via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are returned. However, when searching via the context menu in the packages view, the search works correctly. Currently, the package view initializes the Search dialog with the fully qualified name, which is not found when searching for declarations. The expected behavior is that the search should first try to get the Java element, and if that fails, display the element name instead of the fully qualified name.", "OB": "When searching via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are returned.", "EB": "The search should return the expected results when searching via the Package view selection and dialog.", "SR": "1.
