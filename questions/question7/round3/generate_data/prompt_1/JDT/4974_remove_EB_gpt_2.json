{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974 - Set classpath/output location should be one operation", "description": "", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The issue is caused by the fact that setting the output location and classpath are currently treated as two separate operations, resulting in an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. Go to the project properties. 3. Change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location. 4. Press 'Ok'."}
