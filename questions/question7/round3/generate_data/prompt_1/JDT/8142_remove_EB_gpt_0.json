{"id": "8142", "title": "No scoped type hierarchy on binary projects", "description": "I don't understand the issue related to bug 8142. When I try to view the type hierarchy on a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), I get the following error message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. By the way, can you explain what does this error message mean?", "OB": "When viewing the type hierarchy on a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'' is displayed instead of showing the expected class hierarchies of the internal jars.", "EB": "When viewing the type hierarchy on a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), the expected behavior is to display the class hierarchies of the internal jars instead of showing the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.'", "SR": "To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:\n1. Open a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant).\n2. Attempt to view the type hierarchy by pressing F4.\n3. Observe the error message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.'"}
