{"id": "6125", "title": "Bug 6125 - JAR packager reports open files very late", "description": "When I press the finish button, the JAR creation process fails and displays the error message: 'JAR creation failed: Unsaved Editors'.", "OB": "I expect to be able to create a JAR file even if there are unsaved editors open. Currently, I am unable to create the JAR without first saving all open editors. ", "EB": "To work around this issue, I have to quit the JAR creation wizard, save all open editors, reopen the wizard, and then enter all the fields again. This is inconvenient and time-consuming. Ideally, I should be allowed to create a JAR file with unsaved editors. If it is not possible, there should at least be a dialog prompt to allow saving the unsaved editors before proceeding with JAR creation.", "SR": "1. Open any number of files in the editor. \n2. Open the JAR packager wizard. \n3. Fill in all necessary fields. \n4. Attempt to create the JAR file. \n5. Notice that the JAR creation fails and displays the error message 'JAR creation failed: Unsaved Editors'. \n6. Quit the wizard and save all open editors. \n7. Reopen the JAR packager wizard. \n8. Enter all the fields again. \n9. Attempt to create the JAR file once more. \n10. Observe that the JAR file is successfully created."}
