{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and specifies a bin directory as the output folder, the system should confirm that the bin directory can be deleted successfully and then rebuilt without any issues. If the bin directory contains files other than .class files, those additional files should not affect the rebuild operation. Only the necessary .class files should be generated based on the available .java files.", "SR": ""}
