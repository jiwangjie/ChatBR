It seems that setting the output location and classpath are two separate operations which results in an illegal state when the first operation is set.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. In the project properties, change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
