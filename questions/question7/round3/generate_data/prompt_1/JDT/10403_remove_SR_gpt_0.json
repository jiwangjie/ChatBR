{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, the project is created without confirming if the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "Upon project creation, a confirmation message should be displayed to the user, ensuring that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Select an existing directory structure.\n3. Choose a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Click on the create project button.\n5. Verify that a confirmation message is displayed, confirming that the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt."}
