{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204. While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(' then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "When I type '(' after 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist should suggest and insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' or 'intWidget'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open Build 204. \n2. Write SWT code where 'button.dispose' is typed. \n3. Without looking at the code assist list, type '(' immediately after 'button.dispose'. \n4. Observe that the code assist inserts incorrect suggestion instead of 'dispose()'. "}
