The issue is caused by setting the output location and classpath as two separate operations. Setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974 Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation, similar to the validation process that checks the classpath and output location together. Also, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
