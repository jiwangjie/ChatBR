{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions on text selection are distributed based on personal taste, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, even if they are not in the context menu. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is missing from the context menu.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be available in the context menu.", "SR": "1. Open the edit menu\n2. Look for the action 'Add Javadoc Comment'\n3. Ensure it is present and accessible from the editor menu."}
