{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with:\nbutton.DISPOSED\nwhich isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time.\nCode assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches \"dispose()\" far better than \"DISPOSED\".\nEither that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204. While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "When I type 'button.dispose', the automatic code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. It should insert 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, the code assist feature should be case sensitive when automatically inserting items.", "SR": "1. Open Build 204.\n2. Write SWT code with a button and type 'button.dispose'.\n3. Without realizing that the code assist list is up, continue typing and add a '(' after 'dispose'.\n4. Observe that the code assist inserts 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'."}
