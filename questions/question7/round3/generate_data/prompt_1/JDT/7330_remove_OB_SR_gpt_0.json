I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view in the 'Edit' menu. I think currently we distribute the actions based on personal preference, but this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view to access certain actions.", "OB": "1. The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available on text selection.", "EB": "1. I expected the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' to be available on text selection.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a block of text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Verify if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available. If not, proceed to the next step.\n5. Switch to the 'Outline' view.\n6. Open the 'Edit' menu.\n7. Verify if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available. If it is, the bug is reproduced successfully."}
