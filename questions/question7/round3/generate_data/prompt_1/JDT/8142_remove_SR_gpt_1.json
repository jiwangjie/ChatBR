{"id": "8142", "title": "No Scoped Type Hierarchy on Binary Projects", "description": "I encountered a bug where the scoped type hierarchy is not available on binary projects. When I try to view the type hierarchy for a class in the 'org.apache.ant' package, I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. Is there a way to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars? Can you please explain what this message means?", "OB": "When attempting to view the type hierarchy for a class in the 'org.apache.ant' package (e.g. org.apache.ant), I receive the message 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'.", "EB": "When attempting to view the type hierarchy for a class in the 'org.apache.ant' package (e.g. org.apache.ant), I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars.
