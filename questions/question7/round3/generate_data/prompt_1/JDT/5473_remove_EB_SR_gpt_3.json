Build 200110251.", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft does not behave as expected. The text moves, but it is unclear how this behavior is specified. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). However, in the current behavior, if there is a stray space, the text won't shift and it becomes confusing.", "EB": "", "SR": "1.
