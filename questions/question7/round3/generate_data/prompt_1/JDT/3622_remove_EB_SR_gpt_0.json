When invoking the New Java Package wizard, the following message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists.' This message appears even when the package name field is empty. It is not clear what this message means and whether it is an error or a warning. The message should be clarified or removed. Additionally, the bug report mentions an issue with creating a default package and suggests that it cannot be created by the user since it is always there. This issue should also be addressed.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before entering any text in the package name field, a message appears at the top stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists.'", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before entering any text in the package name field, no message should appear at the top.", "SR": "1.
