This results in a significant performance impact when editing large amounts of text.", "EB": "The widget should only redraw visible lines during a text change with word wrap enabled. This will improve the performance and responsiveness of the StyledText widget. To reproduce the issue, follow the steps below:", "SR": "1. Create a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled.\n2. Populate the widget with a large amount of text.\n3. Make changes to the text that require a redraw, such as adding or deleting characters.\n4. Observe the number of redraws that occur during the text change. It should be limited to one redraw per visible line."}
