Even when opening a small image, such as an icon, the scrollbars are misleading because they do not perform any action.", "EB": "In the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars should be disabled to prevent them from being misleading and not having any effect.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run build F2 (20020602) with Redhat 7.2 and GTK2KDE 2.210(GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and movable, despite not having any effect.\n4. Open a small image, such as an icon, and notice that the scrollbars remain misleading without performing any action."}
