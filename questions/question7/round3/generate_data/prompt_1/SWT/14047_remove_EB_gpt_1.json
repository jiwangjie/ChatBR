Add the following line to performPaint method in StyledText class:\n   System.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight);\n2. Trigger an event or action that appends N new lines to the StyledText in word wrap mode.\n3. Observe the redraws occurring and verify that the entire client area is being redrawn."}
