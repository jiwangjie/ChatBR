{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior is similar to 'autocomplete' which is common in browsers. In the future, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "I'm using the F1 build. The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history of recent searches. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces what you have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history is case insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. In some scenarios, this makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "EB": "When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it should not replace what you have typed with a value from the history. The search of the history should not change the case of what you have typed.", "SR": "1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by choosing Edit > Find/Replace...\n2. Type a value into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type a different value into the 'Find' field and observe if it gets replaced with a value from the history."}
