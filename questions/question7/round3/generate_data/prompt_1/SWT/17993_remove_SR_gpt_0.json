{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of Find/Replace in the F1 build is that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from previous searches in the history. If a match is found, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. This behavior, similar to autocomplete, can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios. It is suggested to change the current behavior to something more simple that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, it is recommended to remove this feature.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace dialog accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace..., the typed entry in the 'Find' field gets replaced with a value from the history if a matching entry is found. The same behavior is observed in the 'Replace With' field. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "The 'Find/Replace' feature in the F1 build should not replace the typed entry with a value from the history. The behavior should be changed to allow the full range of find and replace operations to be performed while preserving the case of the user's input. If a matching entry is found in the history, it should not automatically replace the typed entry. Instead, the user should have the option to select and use the history entry. If such a behavior change is not possible, it is recommended to remove this feature.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document so that Edit -> Find/Replace... becomes available.\n2. Try to type in the 'Find' field or 'Replace With' field.\n3. Notice that if a matching entry is found in the history, the typed entry gets automatically replaced with the history value.\n\nExpected behavior: \n- The typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. The search should not depend on the history entries. \n\nNote: The same behavior should be observed in the 'Replace With' field as well."}
