{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When running the attached code using build 20020920, the left tree and text behave as they should on both Windows and Linux. However, the right tree and text on Windows do not lose focus properly.", "EB": "When running the attached code using build 20020920, the right tree and text should behave the same way as the left tree and text on both Windows and Linux, meaning they should lose focus properly.", "SR": "1. Open the attached code using build 20020920.\n2. Observe the behavior of the left tree and text on both Windows and Linux.\n3. Observe the behavior of the right tree and text on Windows.\n4. Note the difference in focus behavior between the left and right tree and text on Windows."}
