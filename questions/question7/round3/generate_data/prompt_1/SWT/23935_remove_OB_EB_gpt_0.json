{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935 - Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree does not lose focus.", "EB": "When clicking anywhere in the tree, the tree should lose focus.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a window with a tree widget and a text widget. 2. Click anywhere in the tree widget. The tree widget should not retain the focus."}
