Integration build 09/17. The current design looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms (such as Solaris, AIX, HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders which make them look like user input targets. In addition, on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The text fields on the Project Properties Info page should be replaced with readonly text fields or labels. By using readonly text fields or labels, their values can still be selected and copied by the user.", "SR": "Here are the steps to reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the Project Properties dialog. \n2. Navigate to the Info page. \n3. Observe the presence of text fields with automatic borders and different colored backgrounds on motif platforms. \n4. Note the lack of similarities with the design on Windows."}
