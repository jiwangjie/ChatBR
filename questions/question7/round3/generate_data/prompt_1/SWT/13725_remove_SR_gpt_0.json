However, if I repeat the same steps and then select \"Revert\" from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file contents. This seems odd, since reverting the file contents should not take longer than simply closing and reopening the file.", "OB": "When selecting \"Revert\" from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original file contents.", "EB": "Reverting the file contents should be as fast as closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "1.
