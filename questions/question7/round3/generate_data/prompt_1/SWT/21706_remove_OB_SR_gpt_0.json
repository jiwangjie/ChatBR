Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, it would be a good practice to prevent people from instantiating the class unnecessarily. The size of the class will not increase because the compiler provides a free public constructor by default. You're just making the constructor private instead of public.", "SR": "1. Open the BidiUtil class in win32 code.\n2. Add a private constructor to the class."}
