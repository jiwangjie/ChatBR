{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "Currently, when using the Find/Replace feature in the F1 build, the 'Find' and 'Replace With' fields search for entries from a previous search history. If a matching entry is found, the typed entry is automatically replaced with the value from the history. This behavior can make it difficult or impossible to perform find or replace operations. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is commonly seen in web browsers. In the future, it could be beneficial to provide a complete autocomplete feature.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...), if a recent search entry is found in the history, what is typed in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields is replaced with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, meaning that the case of what is typed may be changed to the case of the value in the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "The typed entry in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history. It should retain the exact input as typed by the user. This will allow users to perform find or replace operations without any interference from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the F1 build.\n2. Go to Edit > Find/Replace...\n3. Type something in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.\n4. Verify that the typed entry is not automatically replaced with any value from the history.\n5. Attempt to perform a find or replace operation to ensure that the entered text is used correctly."}
