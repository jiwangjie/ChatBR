Currently, in the integration build 09/17, this page looks bad on all motif platforms. On motif, these text fields automatically get borders, making them appear as user input targets. Furthermore, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the Project Properties Info page displays text fields with automatic borders, indicating them as user input targets. The fields on Solaris/AIX/HPUX also have different colored backgrounds, making them more noticeable.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page on all motif platforms should not display text fields with automatic borders or different colored backgrounds. Instead, an alternative UI component should be used.", "SR": "1. Open the Properties dialog for a project.\n2. Navigate to the Info page.\n3. Observe that text fields are displayed with automatic borders on motif platforms.\n4. Observe that the text fields on Solaris/AIX/HPUX have different colored backgrounds."}
