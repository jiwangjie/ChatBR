{"id": "21706", "title": "BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage ", "OB": "The current implementation of BidiUtil in the win32 version has a line of code that uses Class.forName(). This line is causing a problem because it throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This leads to issues in the CLDC version of SWT. However, this problem is not visible during compilation as the call is generated by the compiler itself.", "EB": "To fix this issue, I suggest adding a private constructor in BidiUtil. Since there are no nonstatic methods in this class, making the constructor private will prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class. This change will not increase the size of the constructor, as the compiler provides a free public constructor by default. It simply restricts access to the constructor from outside the class.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, use the CLDC version of SWT and verify or use jxeLink or a similar tool. Then, observe the NoClassDefFoundError occurring due to the Class.forName() usage in the BidiUtil class."}
