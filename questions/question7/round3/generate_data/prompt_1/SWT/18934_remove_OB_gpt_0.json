{"id": "18934", "title": "Bug 18934 - Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example", "description": "", "OB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example in build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2, GTK2 KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), the scrollbars are enabled. It is possible to move them around, but they do not have any effect. This behavior is observed when opening a small image, such as an icon. The scrollbars are misleading because they do not perform any function.", "EB": "The scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example should be disabled when opening a small image, such as an icon. They should not be enabled or allow any movement, as they do not serve a purpose.", "SR": "1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Verify the presence of scrollbars.\n3. Open a small image, such as an icon, in the ImageAnalyzer.\n4. Observe the scrollbars and verify that they are disabled and do not allow any movement."}
