However, this approach may cause performance issues and unnecessary overhead.", "EB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 should be loaded directly as a callback, without using Class.forName().", "SR": "Change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);\n\nI haven't tested it, but it should function the same way as the existing code and avoid the unnecessary usage of Class.forName()."}
