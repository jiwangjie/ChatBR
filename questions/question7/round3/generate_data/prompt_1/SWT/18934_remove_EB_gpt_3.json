Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Notice the scrollbars are enabled, and you can move them around, but they don't have any effect.\n3. If you open a small image, like an icon, the scrollbars are just misleading because they don't do anything.", "EB": "When opening the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars are currently enabled.\nHowever, they should be disabled of images with dimensions that are smaller than the viewable area.", "SR": "Build F2 (20020602)\nRedhat 7.2, GTK2KDE 2.10 (GTK2 only)\n\n1. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n2. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled even for small images.\n3. Attempt to move the scrollbars and check if any scrolling effect is observed.\n\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR:\nThe scrollbars should be disabled for small images as they do not have any effect on the viewable area."}
