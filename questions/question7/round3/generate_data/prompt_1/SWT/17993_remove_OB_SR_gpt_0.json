{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete', which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When using the Find/Replace functionality, if a value from the history is selected, it replaces the typed entry.", "EB": "When using the Find/Replace functionality, the typed entry should not be replaced with a value from the history. Instead, the feature should allow for a full range of find and replace operations to be performed. The behavior should also respect the case of what the user types. If necessary, the feature should be removed until the desired behavior can be implemented.", "SR": "1. Open a document.\n2. Use the Edit menu to select 'Find/Replace...'.\n3. Verify that the typed entry in the 'Find' field is not replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the 'Replace With' field."}
