{"id": "13725", "title": "Bug 13725: Revert is much slower than close and reopen in Java editor", "description": "When performing the actions of closing and reopening a file in the Java editor, there is a significant difference in speed between selecting 'Close' and then reopening the file, compared to selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu. The 'Revert' operation takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original content. This is much slower compared to the 'Close' and reopen process, which takes about 8 seconds.", "OB": "The observed behavior is as follows: after opening an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository, marking the file as dirty by adding a space character at the end of the first line, and performing the actions of closing the editor tab, answering 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, and then double-clicking the file in the navigator to reopen it, selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu takes approximately 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original content.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that selecting 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor should not take significantly longer than the process of closing the file and reopening it.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open source repository.\n2) Add a space character at the end of the first line to mark the file as dirty.\n3) Close the editor tab by clicking on the close box.\n4) When prompted with the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, choose 'no'.\n5) Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n6) Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n\nExpected result: The contents of the window should be replaced with the original content without significant delay."}
