{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "Bug 21706BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "OB": "The issue is related to the usage of Class.forName() in the BidiUtil class in the win32 version. In the line `static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);`, the BidiUtil.class is used as a shortcut for `Class.forName(\"org...BidiUtil\")`. However, this method throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. This causes a problem in the CLDC version of SWT. The problem can be observed when verifying or using jxeLink or similar tools. The Eclipse and Sun's compilers do not raise a compiler error for this issue.", "EB": "The expected behavior is to remove the reflection usage in the BidiUtil class to avoid the NoClassDefFoundError.", "SR": "To fix this issue, change the line above to: `static Callback callback = new Callback (new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);`. This change should achieve the same functionality without relying on reflection. Note: The suggested solution has not been tested yet."}
