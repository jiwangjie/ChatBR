{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace function is replacing what is typed with a value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. However, it would be better if what is typed is not automatically replaced and a full autocomplete feature could be provided in the future.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches for entries from a previous search. For example, if the user searches for 'hello' and replaces it with 'hi', then attempts to search for 'Hello' and replace it with 'Hi', the application does not allow it.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application should not automatically replace what is typed with values from the history. The user should be able to type freely without interference.", "SR": "1. Open the application and navigate to the 'Find/Replace' feature.\n2. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field and observe if it allows the input without being replaced by a value from history."}
