{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text never loses focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree should not get focus. On Linux, the text widget should lose focus when you click on the tree, just like it does on Windows.", "SR": "1. Open the application on Linux.\n2. Click anywhere in the tree.\n3. Observe that the tree gets focus, but the text widget does not lose focus.\n4. Repeat the same steps on Windows and observe that the text widget loses focus when you click on the tree."}
