Currently, there are no non-static methods in this class, so it would be a good practice to have a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instantiation. This change will not increase the size as the compiler already provides a default public constructor.", "SR": "To address the issue, change the line above to: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4); It is recommended to test the solution to ensure it functions as expected."}
