", "EB": "This seems unusual because reverting the file contents should not take more time than closing and reopening the file. ", "SR": "1) Open an editor on the file 'org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java' from the source folder 'Eclipse SWTCustom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open-source repository.\n2) Select the end of the first line and add a space character to mark the file as dirty.\n3) On my (fast) machine at home, it takes about 8 seconds to perform the following steps:\n   a) Click on the close box in the editor tab.\n   b) Choose 'No' in the 'Do you want to save changes' dialog.\n   c) Double click on the file in the navigator to reopen it.\n4) However, if I repeat steps 1) and 2), and then select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original."}
