{"id": "23787", "title": "Bug 23787 - Project Properties Info page should not use text fields", "description": "Integration build 09/17. The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields as it looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On Windows, the project properties info page appears fine. However, on motif platforms, these text fields get automatic borders, making them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even worse.", "EB": "The Project Properties Info page should not use text fields on all platforms, including motif platforms. Instead, a different UI element should be used to display the information.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, select a project and right-click to open the context menu. Choose 'Properties' and navigate to the subsequent Info page. Notice that the readonly fields (such as Path, Type, etc.) are displayed as text fields instead of using a different UI element."}
