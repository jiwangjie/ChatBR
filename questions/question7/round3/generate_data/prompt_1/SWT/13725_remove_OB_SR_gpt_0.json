{"id": "13725", "title": "Revert is much slower than close and reopen in the Java editor", "description": "When performing the action of reverting a file in the Java editor, it is observed that the process is significantly slower compared to the action of closing and reopening the file. This behavior is unexpected and does not align with the assumption that reverting the file contents should be a faster operation.", "OB": "When attempting to revert a file in the Java editor, the process takes a noticeably longer time compared to when closing and reopening the file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that reverting the file contents should take a comparable amount of time as closing and reopening the file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open a file in the Java editor.\n2. Perform the action of reverting the file contents using the appropriate command or menu option.\n3. Note the time taken for the revert operation.\n4. Close the file and reopen it.\n5. Compare the time taken for closing, reopening, and reverting operations."}
