{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from previous searches and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history.", "EB": "For me, it is very common to perform operations like this. I think the current behavior should be changed to something more simple which allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. However, this should still respect the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a document so that 'Edit > Find/Replace...' becomes available. 2. Try to type in the 'Find' field. 3. It should search for entries from a previous search and replace the typed entry with a value from the history. 4. To test the 'Replace With' field, follow the same steps as above."}
