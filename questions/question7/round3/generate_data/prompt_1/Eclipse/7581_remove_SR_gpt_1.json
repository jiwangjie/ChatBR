", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. The width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column.", "EB": "I expected the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column. Note that it should work the same as the DialogCellEditor where the button is always visible. We need to investigate whether this issue is caused by our application or the SWT library.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Add a cell with ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Notice that the width of the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column."}
