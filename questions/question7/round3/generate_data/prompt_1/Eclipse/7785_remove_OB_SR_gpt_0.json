The icon has also changed from the parent Java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "When saving a file using the SaveAs function, the file does not retain its original file type. The file icon is also changed to a generic file icon.", "EB": "The file is now treated as a generic file, and when opened, it is displayed as plain text. The expected behavior is that the file should be saved with the same extension as the original file, unless explicitly changed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Open a file.\n2. Select the 'SaveAs' option from the menu.\n3. Choose a new location and enter a new name for the file.\n4. Verify that the file is saved with the correct extension and the file icon remains the same as the original file."}
