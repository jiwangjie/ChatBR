{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734 - System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "The system can be shut down without any save file warnings or prompts.", "EB": "The system should provide a 'Do you want to save your file?' dialog box with options to save ('Yes'), not save ('No'), or cancel the shutdown ('Cancel'). If cancel is selected, it should halt the shutdown. Additionally, it would be helpful to allow applications to control the shutdown/save process or to pop up their own windows that would also allow the user to stop the shutdown if 'Cancel' is selected.", "SR": ""}
