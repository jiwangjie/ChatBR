Make sure you have associated a Windows editor with your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right click on the java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a java file by simply double clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right click on the java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected result:\n- A warning message should be displayed stating that you may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue, or\n- An error message should be displayed stating that the file cannot be opened in another editor until it is closed in the workbench.\n\nWe believe this behavior is a safety feature where the IDE doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in the IDE."}
