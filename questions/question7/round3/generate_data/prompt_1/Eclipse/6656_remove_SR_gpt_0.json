{"id": "6656", "title": "Bug 6656: Close button moves down when view resized smaller", "description": "", "OB": "On Linux, running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on NT2000), when a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label. However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. This behavior is unexpected and can confuse users.", "EB": "Normally, these two tool items should stay on the same line as the label regardless of the view's size. This ensures the close button is located to the far right corner, which users are accustomed to. However, in the current state, when the view size is reduced, the close button and the pulldown menu icon move to a new line, causing a usability problem.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the application on Linux, using build 20011127. 2. Open a view such as the Navigator. 3. Resize the view to be smaller. 4. Observe that the tool items, including the close button, move below the label. This behavior is not expected and should be fixed to maintain the close button on the same line as the label and located to the far right corner."}
