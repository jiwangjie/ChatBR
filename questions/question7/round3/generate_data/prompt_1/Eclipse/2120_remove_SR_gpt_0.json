{"id": "2120", "title": "Bug 2120 - MRU File List is not persisted between sessions", "description": "", "OB": "The bug is related to the MRU (Most Recently Used) File List in the File menu. Currently, when files are opened in the application, they appear in the MRU list. However, after closing and reopening the application, the MRU list does not show the previously opened files.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the MRU File List should be persisted between sessions. This means that the previously opened files should appear in the MRU list even after closing and reopening the application.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Open several files using the File menu.\n3. Close the application.\n4. Reopen the application.\n\nExpected result: The MRU File List should show the previously opened files.\n\nNote: The implementation should use the IPersistableElement and not rely on peeking into the underlying resource. The IEditorInput may not always represent a resource."}
