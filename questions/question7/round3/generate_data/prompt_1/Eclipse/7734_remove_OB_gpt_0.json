{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.", "EB": "The system should provide a \"Do you want to save your file?\" dialog box with options for Yes, No, and Cancel. Selecting Cancel should halt the shutdown process.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start WSWB and create a new project. 2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. 3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file. 4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the \"Shut Down\" command to shutdown/reboot the computer. Expected results: A warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their dirty files before the computer is shut down/rebooted. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) provide this feature."}
