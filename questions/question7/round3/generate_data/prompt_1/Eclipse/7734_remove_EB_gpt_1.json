Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shutdown/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected results:\n- A warning or question message box should appear, giving users a chance to save their dirty model(s) before the computer is shut down or rebooted.\n\nActual results:\n- There is no warning or question message box, and the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.\n- This behavior differs from other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook, etc.) where a warning message is displayed when unsaved changes are present."}
