{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com>:\n\nI'm experiencing an issue with the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet. When using a ComboBoxCellEditor, the combo box does not size correctly based on the width of the property sheet column. The problem occurs when one of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the column. In this case, the combo box grows to fit the widest item, but the drop-down button is then positioned off the visible area of the property sheet, so it is clipped. This means that the user cannot see the drop-down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area. We need to investigate whether this issue is related to our code or to SWT.", "OB": "The combo box does not size correctly in the property sheet column if one of the strings is wider than the column. As a result, the drop-down button is positioned off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column. The drop-down button should always be visible, regardless of the width of the strings in the combo box.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object using the row of name-value pairs.\n3. Use a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet.\n4. Make sure one of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n5. Observe that the combo box grows to fit the widest item, causing the drop-down button to be positioned off the visible area of the property sheet."}
