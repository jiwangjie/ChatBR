", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. If any of the strings in the editor's drop-down list is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the widest item. However, the drop-down button may now be positioned too far to the right and clipped off the visible area of the property sheet. As a result, the user cannot see the drop-down button unless they make the property sheet view wider.", "EB": "I expect the ComboBoxCellEditor to size correctly in the property sheet, ensuring that both the combo box and the drop-down button are fully visible.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Open the property sheet with objects to edit.\n2. Locate a property with a long string value.\n3. Click on the cell to activate the editor with the drop-down list.\n4. Observe if the combo box and drop-down button are fully visible within the property sheet column.\n\nExpected result: The combo box and drop-down button should be fully visible within the property sheet column, regardless of the width of the strings in the drop-down list."}
