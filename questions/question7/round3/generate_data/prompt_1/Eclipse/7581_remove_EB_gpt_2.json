{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester:\n\nI am experiencing an issue with the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet. When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, the property sheet consists of a set of rows that are name-value pairs displayed in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the createCellEditor method of IPropertyDescriptor to create editors, one of which is a ComboBoxCellEditor. The constructor of the ComboBoxCellEditor allows me to provide a list of strings for the drop-down. The ComboBoxCellEditor is displayed in the second column of the property sheet, with the drop-down button appearing at the right edge of the column. \n\nThe problem arises when any of the strings in the drop-down list is wider than the width of the column. It seems that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. However, this causes the drop-down button to be positioned too far to the right, causing it to be clipped outside the visible area of the property sheet. As a result, users are unable to see the drop-down button unless they make the property sheet view wider, until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly.

The combo box should not exceed the width of the column, and the drop-down button should always remain within the visible area of the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet containing objects with ComboBoxCellEditor in the second column.\n2. Ensure that the drop-down list contains strings wider than the column width.\n3. Observe that the combo box resizes to the width of the largest item in the drop-down list.\n4. Notice that the drop-down button is positioned outside the visible area of the property sheet and gets clipped.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The combo box should not exceed the width of the column.\n- The drop-down button should always remain within the visible area of the property sheet."}
