System Editor', nothing happens. We expect the workbench to display a warning message indicating that we may overwrite changes and asking if we want to continue, or display an error message indicating that we should close all files first. We believe this is a safety feature where WSAD doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "Ensure that a Windows editor is associated with the java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files. Then, in the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With .. System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window should pop up with the java file opened. After closing it, go to the Java Perspective and open the java file by double-clicking on it. Now, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With .. System Editor'.
