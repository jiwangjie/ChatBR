In the 'Export' dialog window, after selecting both projects and specifying a zip file name, clicking the 'Export' button results in an error message box. The error message states that problems were encountered during the export and provides details indicating that the file with the same name in project2 is the cause of the problem.", "EB": "The export process should succeed without encountering any errors.
