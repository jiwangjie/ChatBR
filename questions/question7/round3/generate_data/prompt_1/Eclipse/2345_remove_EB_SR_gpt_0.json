Instead, it reactivates the scripted resource editor example.\n\nSearching for an existing open file should also consider editor types.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n- When 'Open With...' is used to select a different type of editor for an already open file, it should open a new editor for the file because the editor type is different.\n\nNOTES: ", "EB": "When 'Open With...' > 'Default Text Editor' is selected for an already open file, the file should be opened in the default text editor as expected.", "SR": "1.
