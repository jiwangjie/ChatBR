The expected behavior is that the refiltering should only occur when closing the working set selection dialog, not during the manipulation of the working set. Additionally, pressing cancel should cancel all changes made to the working sets, including canceling the removal of a working set.", "OB": "1. Create a working set with one project and select it. 2.

Refiltering should only happen when closing the working set selection dialog. Canceling the removal action should also cancel any changes made to the working sets.", "SR": "1.
