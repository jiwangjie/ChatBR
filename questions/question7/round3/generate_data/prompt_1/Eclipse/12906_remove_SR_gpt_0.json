The expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed, indicating that all files should be closed first. We believe this is a safety feature implemented in WSAD to prevent external editing while a file is already opened.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning message displayed.", "SR": "1. Close the file in the workbench.\n2. Go to the Java Perspective.\n3. Double-click on a java file to open it in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the Java file.\n5. Select 'Open With' > 'System Editor'.\n6. Observe if a warning message is displayed or not."}
