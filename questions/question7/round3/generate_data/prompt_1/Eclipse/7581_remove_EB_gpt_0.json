{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects, the ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor are wider than the width of the property sheet column, the ComboBoxCellEditor grows to be the width of the largest item. However, this causes the drop-down button to be positioned too far to the right and off the visible area of the property sheet, resulting in being clipped. As a result, users cannot see the ComboBoxCellEditor's drop-down button without increasing the width of the property sheet view.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Use the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects with ComboBoxCellEditor in column two of the property sheet. \n2. Set one of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor to a wider width than the property sheet column. \n3. Observe that the ComboBoxCellEditor grows to the width of the largest item, causing the drop-down button to be positioned off the visible area of the property sheet and clipped. \n4. Increase the width of the property sheet view to reveal the drop-down button."}
