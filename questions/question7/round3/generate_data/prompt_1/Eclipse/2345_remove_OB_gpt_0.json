Open a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml' in the project.\n3. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'.\n4. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'.\n5. Verify that a new editor opens for the file, instead of reactivating the current editor.\n\nAdditional Notes: The scripted resource editor example should open on XML files by default, but it ignores the XML file content. Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types."}
