It seems to have a fixed width and does not expand to fit the text of the selected item. This issue can be observed when using the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet. The expected behavior is for the ComboBoxCellEditor to dynamically adjust its width to fit the selected item text.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not dynamically adjust its width when used in the property sheet.
