However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. A UI (Preference) should be provided by the Workbench to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values for the line delimiter should include: Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. The UI should be consistent across all plugins to ensure that they use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter used for the new file is Unix line delimiter.\n4. Change the line delimiter preference in the Workbench.\n5. Repeat step 2.\n6. Verify that the line delimiter for the new file now matches the preference set in step 4."}
