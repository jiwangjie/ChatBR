There should be a warning message displayed by the workbench informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be shown indicating that all files need to be closed before opening this file. This behavior is believed to be a safety feature in WSAD, preventing external editing while a file is already open in WSAD.", "EB": "When a file is already open in one editor, attempting to open the same file in another editor should display a warning message in the workbench, cautioning about potential changes being overwritten and prompting the user to confirm their action.
