However, when I select test.xml in the Navigator and choose 'Open With' -> 'Default Text Editor', nothing happens. It seems that the scripted resource editor is reactivated instead of opening the file with the default text editor. It should open a new editor on the file, considering the different editor types.", "EB": "When I follow the steps in 1GEWMOZ to create a new basic project and add a file named test.xml, the file is opened with the scripted resource editor example by default.
