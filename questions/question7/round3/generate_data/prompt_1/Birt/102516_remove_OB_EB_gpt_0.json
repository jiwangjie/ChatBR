The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. However, when the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' error message. Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When opening the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query, the entire schema is queried and all the tables and columns are loaded at once, causing a long wait time.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query should load tables and columns on demand instead of querying the entire schema upfront. This will improve the loading time and prevent the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' error message from appearing.", "SR": "To reproduce: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query. 2. Observe that the entire schema is being queried and all the tables and columns are loaded at once. 3. Note the long wait time and the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' error message. 4. It should be possible to filter based on schema to avoid loading unnecessary tables and columns."}
