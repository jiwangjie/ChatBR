{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression contains a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to various issues and should be reconsidered.", "OB": "In the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if filter information is entered in the column mapping XPath expression, such as 'section[@id='left']', the information is being stripped off and not persisted when leaving the dialog.", "EB": "In the XML Edit Data Set dialog, when filter information is entered in the column mapping XPath expression, such as 'section[@id='left']', the information should be retained and persisted when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for column mapping with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Exit the dialog.\n4. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog again and verify if the filter information is still present in the column mapping XPath expression."}
