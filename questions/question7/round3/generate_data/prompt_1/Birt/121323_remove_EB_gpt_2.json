However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation class gets persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression in the column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'.\n3.
