{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "The current behavior of BIRT designer when including a library in a report design is not storing the relative path.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open a report design in the BIRT designer.\n2. Include a library from a different directory using the absolute path, for example, $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n3. Check if the BIRT designer stores the relative path correctly for the included library."}
