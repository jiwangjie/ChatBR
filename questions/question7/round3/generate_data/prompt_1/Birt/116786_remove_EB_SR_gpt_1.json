{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the report design stores the absolute path of the library include. It should be updated to save the relative path instead. The observed behavior shows that the <property> tag contains the absolute path: <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>. This needs to be changed to save the relative path.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
