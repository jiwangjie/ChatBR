{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from metadata object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the getcolumnlabel method in the metadata object does not return any labels for the columns. This means that when the labels need to be displayed to the end user before doing the extraction, the getcolumnlabel method does not provide the necessary information.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the getcolumnlabel method should return some user recognizable strings for the columns. The labels returned by getcolumnlabel before extraction should be the same as the labels displayed to the end user after extraction.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, create a metadata object and call the getcolumnlabel method for any column. Verify that the method does not return any labels for the column. The expected behavior is that the method should return a user recognizable string as the label for the column."}
