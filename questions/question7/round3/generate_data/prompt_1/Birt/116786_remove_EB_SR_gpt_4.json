{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "When I open the report design, I observe that the property 'fileName' stores the absolute path of the included library. However, it should save the relative path.", "EB": "The 'fileName' property should be updated to store the relative path of the included library.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the report design.\n2. Check the 'fileName' property of the included library.\n3. Verify that it is storing the absolute path instead of the relative path.\n4. Update the 'fileName' property to store the relative path and save the report design.\n5. Reopen the report design to ensure that the 'fileName' property now contains the relative path."}
