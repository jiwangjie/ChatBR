{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression includes a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to the .rptdesign file but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. This behavior of treating XPath expressions in this way will likely result in numerous issues.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, including a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog.\n5. Open the .rptdesign file.\n6. Observe that the RelationInformation is persisted, but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
