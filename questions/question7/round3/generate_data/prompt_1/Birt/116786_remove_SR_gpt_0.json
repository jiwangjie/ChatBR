{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path", "description": "", "OB": "When including a library in a report design, the absolute path is being stored instead of the relative path. For example, <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'/>.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when including a library in a report design. For example, if my report design is located in $project/test, the relative path should be saved as './otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1. Open the BIRT designer. \n2. Create a new report design. \n3. Include a library in the report design. \n4. Check the file path stored for the included library and ensure it is saved as a relative path instead of an absolute path."}
