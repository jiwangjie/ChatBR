{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "", "OB": "The report displays the same results regardless of the dynamic text element's Content Type property setting (Auto, Plain, or HTML).", "EB": "When setting the Content Type property to Plain, I expect the literal content to be displayed with all tags included. When set to Auto, I expect content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without any HTML or RTF tags. Finally, when set to HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without any HTML tags, and content 3 to appear as it is with RTF tags.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Prepare a database field with the following types of content: \na) HTML text within <html>...</html> tags. \nb) HTML fragments not within <html> tags. \nc) Text with RTF tags. \n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field in a report."}
