It would be better to improve the logic to handle border values more efficiently.", "OB": "Not provided", "EB": "Currently, the disk sorting logic for row values with border values is not efficient. It is expected that a more efficient logic will be implemented. One possible improvement is to sort the data directly in memory and then write it to the file.", "SR": "1.
