The message contains the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page. The dialog is titled 'Error' with quotes. This behavior is confusing and needs to be improved.", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and trying to switch back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed.", "EB": "The error message needs to use a more appropriate title and should not include quotes.", "SR": "1.
