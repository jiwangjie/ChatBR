{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include does not store relative path.", "description": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path when a library is included in a report design. Currently, when including a library from a different location, the absolute path is being stored instead of the relative path.", "OB": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer is storing the absolute path of the library instead of the relative path.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should store the relative path of the included library in the report design.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the BIRT designer. \n2. Create a new report design. \n3. Include a library from a different location using the File > Include Library option. \n4. Save the report design. \n5. Check the stored path for the included library. It should be the relative path instead of the absolute path."}
