The user is then prompted with the options to save, discard, or cancel the changes. However, the dialog box is titled \"Error\". This behavior is problematic because the user is left to figure out how to save or discard the changes, and the error message itself is not clear.", "OB": "When editing XML in the \"source\" view and switching to the Layout view without saving changes, an error message is displayed.", "EB": "When attempting to switch from the \"source\" view to the Layout view without saving changes, a clear prompt should be displayed to save or discard changes before navigating to the Layout view.", "SR": "1.
