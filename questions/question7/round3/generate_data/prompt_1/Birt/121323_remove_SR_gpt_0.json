{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part is entered for the column mapping, such as section[@id='left']. In the class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This treatment of XPath expressions may lead to various issues.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part, such as section[@id='left'], for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, upon leaving the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is not persisted.", "EB": "Instead of stripping off the selection part of the XPath expression in the column mapping, the XML Edit Data Set dialog should allow using the plain XPath expression, with the path from the data set selector itself prepended. Filtering should be an option for those who require it.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part into the column mapping, such as section[@id='left'].\n3. Add any additional configurations if necessary.\n4. Leave the dialog and check if the filter information is persisted correctly in the .rptdesign file."}
