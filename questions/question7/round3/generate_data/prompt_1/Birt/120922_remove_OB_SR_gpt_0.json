This message prevents the user from accessing other pages until the changes are saved. The user is then left to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).\n\nA better and more typical approach would be to inform the user that the XML Report Design has been changed and provide clear options for saving or discarding the changes. The dialog should use a better title and should not include the quotes.", "OB": "'Dirty Page' message is displayed with options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'.
