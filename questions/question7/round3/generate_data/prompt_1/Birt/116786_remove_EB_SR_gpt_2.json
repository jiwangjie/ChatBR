{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "", "OB": "Currently, the report design is storing the absolute path of the library include. It should be saving the relative path instead. For example, the current path is <property name=\"fileName\"/>E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>, which is an absolute path. We need to modify it to <property name=\"fileName\"/>../otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property> so that it uses a relative path.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
