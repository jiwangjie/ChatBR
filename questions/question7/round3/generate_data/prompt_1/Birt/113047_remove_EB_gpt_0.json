The steps to reproduce this issue are as follows: 1. Create a new data set without an SQL statement. 2. The new data source should have no database/table/column information. The observed behavior is that there is no children node listing when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab. Closing the data set editor and reopening it does not resolve the issue.", "EB": "", "SR": "Bug 113047: No children node listing when changing data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab.
