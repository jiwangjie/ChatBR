The steps to reproduce are as follows: 1. Create a new data set without a SQL statement. 2. The new data source has no database/table/column information. The actual result is that there are no children listed when changing the data source for a data set on the data set editor page of the query tab. Additionally, closing the data set editor and reopening it does not resolve the issue.", "EB": "The expected result is that when changing the data source, the children of the new data source should be listed.", "SR": "1.

Close the data set editor and reopen it to confirm that the issue persists."}
