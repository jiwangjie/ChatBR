{"id": "102436", "title": "Bug 102436 - Date/time value not stored correctly in report design", "description": "An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected.", "OB": "When a user enters an invalid date/time string in the 'default value' field of a 'DateTime' type report parameter in the BIRT report designer, such as '55/66/9999', the system does not reject the input and allows it to be stored.", "EB": "The BIRT report designer should validate the date value entered in the 'default value' field of a 'DateTime' type report parameter. If an invalid date/time string is entered, such as '55/66/9999', the system should reject the input and display an error message.", "SR": "1. Open the BIRT report designer.\n2. Create a new report.\n3. Add a 'DateTime' type report parameter.\n4. In the 'default value' field of the report parameter, enter an invalid date string, such as '55/66/9999'.\n5.
