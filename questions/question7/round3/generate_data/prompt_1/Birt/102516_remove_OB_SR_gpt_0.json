{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, all tables and columns are loaded when the page is loaded, which can negatively impact performance, especially when dealing with large data sources. The expected behavior is for the tables and columns to be loaded on demand, either when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "Currently, all tables and columns are loaded when the page is loaded.", "EB": "The tables and columns should be loaded on demand, i.e., when the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that all tables and columns are loaded.\n3. Expand the tree and check if the tables and columns are loaded on demand.\n4. Apply a filter and verify if the tables and columns are loaded on demand."}
