{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. The code in CVS from 06/30/05 includes a schema filter, but there is still a warning message on load because the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, even if there are several hundred tables.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should only load tables and columns on demand, rather than loading all schemas and tables on load.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Check that the tree control initially shows no tables or columns.\n3. Interact with the UI to trigger the loading of tables and columns for a specific schema or catalog.\n4. Verify that only the requested tables and columns are loaded, and there are no warning messages on load."}
