{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if the expression includes a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. This behavior causes trouble and should be addressed.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information, including any XPath expressions with a selection part, when leaving the dialog.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part.\n3. Leave the dialog.\n4. Verify that the filter information, including the XPath expression, is correctly persisted and not lost."}
