{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "", "OB": "The report design currently stores the absolute path of the included library. We need to save the relative path instead. For example, in the property <property name='fileName' value='/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' />, the absolute path '/E:/birt/sampleReports' is stored.", "EB": "", "SR": "To address this bug, when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. For example, if my report design is located at $project/test and I include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved as otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary."}
