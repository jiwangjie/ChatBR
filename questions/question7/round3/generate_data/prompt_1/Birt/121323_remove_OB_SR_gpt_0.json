{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when the application is closed and reopened. Currently, if a user sets a filter in the dialog and then closes the application, the filter is not saved and the dialog resets to its default filter settings.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist filter information when the application is closed and reopened. This means that if a user sets a filter in the dialog and then closes the application, the filter should be saved and the dialog should retain the previously set filter settings upon reopening the application.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the application and navigate to the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Set a filter in the dialog. 3. Close the application and reopen it. 4. Navigate back to the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 5. Verify that the previously set filter is not persisted and the dialog resets to its default filter settings."}
