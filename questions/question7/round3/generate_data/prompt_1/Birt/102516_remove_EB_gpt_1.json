{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and users have to wait for the loading process to complete, resulting in a warning message stating that only 500 items can be viewed in the available list. This bug is related to bug 101372, which requests the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control shows every schema on the system, resulting in a large number of tables displayed. When using the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, the schema filter does not prevent the warning message from appearing on page load, indicating that the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control should only load the tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema on page load. This will improve the loading time and prevent the warning message about the limited number of items that can be viewed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open the data set editor and observe the loading process. The warning message indicating the limit of items that can be viewed should appear, suggesting that the entire schema is being queried on load. The expected behavior is that the tree control should only load the tables and columns when requested, avoiding the warning message."}
