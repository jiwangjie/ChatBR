{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516\n\nThe JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a while to load. Eventually, a message saying 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "The data set editor should load the tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema on editor open. This would improve the loading time and prevent the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message from being displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the data set editor.\n2. Observe the loading time and the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message.\n\nAlso, check if Bug 101372 (link: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372) can be implemented to allow filtering based on schema."}
