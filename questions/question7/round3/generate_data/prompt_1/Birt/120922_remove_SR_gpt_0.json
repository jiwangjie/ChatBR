Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes.

In addition, the dialog is titled \"Error\" (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. This problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very clear. The error message is \"Source page is dirty.\"", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be:\n\n\"The XML Report Design has been changed.\"\n\nThe dialog needs to use a better title (and certainly should not have the quotes).", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer.\n2. Edit the XML in the \"source\" view of the Layout Editor.\n3.
