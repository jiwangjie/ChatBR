{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Currently, even with the schema filter, the tree is being populated on load, resulting in a warning message.  The suggestion is to defer the load of the tree until the user expands it or applies a filter.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform, using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the tree control in the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query displays every schema (catalog) on the system. This can result in displaying several hundred tables. When I use the code from CVS from 6/30/05, I see that the schema filter is implemented. However, despite the filter, I still receive a warning message on page load due to the tree being populated at that time.", "EB": "To improve performance and prevent the warning message, it is suggested to defer the loading of the tree until the user expands it or applies a filter.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query.\n2. Use the iSeries platform and the JTOpenJDBC drivers.\n3. Observe that the tree control displays every schema (catalog) on the system.\n4. Apply a schema filter and reload the page.\n5. Check if a warning message is still displayed on page load and if the tree is being populated immediately or deferred until expanded or filtered."}
