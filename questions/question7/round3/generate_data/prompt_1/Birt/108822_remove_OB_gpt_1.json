{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic is expected for disk sorting when there is a boundary value for the row value", "description": "", "OB": "The current logic for disk sorting does not handle cases with a boundary value for the row value correctly.", "EB": "A more efficient logic should be implemented for disk sorting when there is a boundary value for the row value. The data should be sorted directly in memory and then written to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Prepare a dataset with 40000 rows. 2. Set the program to process the data less than 40000 rows. 3. Save the file as a temporary file. 4. Load the file to memory. 5. Perform sorting on the data. 6. Save the sorted data to the temporary file."}
