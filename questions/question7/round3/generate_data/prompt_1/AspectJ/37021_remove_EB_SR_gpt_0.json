See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to reproduce the problem. Limitations of the tests: These tests generate false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, if the filename makes no sense, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": "The declare warning messages for .class files from injars display the sourcepath as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. It has also been observed that in some cases, the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that issue.", "EB": "The declare warning messages should accurately display the sourcepath as 'app/Main' for .class files from injars. The filenames should consistently appear in the messages as well.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Navigate to the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' directory\n2. Run the code provided in that directory\n3. Observe the declare warning messages for .class files from injars to see the incorrect sourcepath and missing filenames"}
