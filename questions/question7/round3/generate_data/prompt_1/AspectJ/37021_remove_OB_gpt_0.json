To reproduce the problem, run the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. . However, please note that this test has some limitations. It may produce false positives because filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. It seems that AJDT omits the source path if it does not make sense to AJDT.\n\n", "OB": "The observed behavior is not provided in the bug report.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is displayed in the incorrect format. It is in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\".", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the code located at tests/new/binaryWarnings/..\n2. Verify the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars\n3. Note that the source path is displayed as \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main\"."}
