Tests in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ folder can be used to reproduce the issue. Please note that these tests may give false positives due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. The issue has been observed in AJDT, where the filename is omitted if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes, the filenames do not appear at all but this is not reproduced by the provided tests.", "EB": "The sourcepath should be listed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class' in the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the provided tests in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ folder and observe the source path in the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars."}
