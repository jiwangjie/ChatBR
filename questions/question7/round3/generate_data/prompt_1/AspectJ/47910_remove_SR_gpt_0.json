{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When calling ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar, an output file is created with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc suggests that the 'outjar' parameter should put the output classes in a zip file, but having a parameter called 'outjar' that creates a zip file instead of a valid jar file is confusing.", "OB": "When using the 'outjar' parameter, the resulting file is a zip file without a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "If the 'outjar' parameter is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file with a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Call ajc with the 'sourceroots' parameter, the input directory as '<mydir>', and the 'outjar' parameter with the output file name as '<my.jar>'.\n2. Verify that the created file is a zip file without a MANIFEST.MF file."}
