{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path wrong in declare warning on binary files", "description": "Bug 37021 is about the source path being incorrect in declare warning messages on binary files. Currently, when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form of 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. This issue can be replicated by running the code provided in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings' directory. Please note that the current tests have limitations and may result in false positives for detecting this error due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It seems that AJDT omits the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages on binary files is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages on binary files should be listed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Go to the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings' directory.\n2. Execute the code provided in the directory.\n3. Check the declare warning messages on binary files.\n4. Observe that the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
