{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using the outjar option with ajc, the resulting file should be a valid jar file. However, currently, if a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file is present inside the project, it is not included in the generated jar file.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the sourceroots option followed by my input directory and then use the outjar option followed by a desired output file name with .jar extension, it creates an output file. However, the resulting file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "When I call ajc with the sourceroots option followed by my input directory and then use the outjar option followed by a desired output file name with .jar extension, it should create a valid jar file. The resulting jar file should include the content of the input directory and a MANIFEST.MF file, if present inside the project.", "SR": "To reproduce: \n1. Invoke ajc with the sourceroots option followed by the directory containing the source files. \n2. Use the outjar option followed by a desired output file name with .jar extension. \n3. Check the generated jar file for the presence of the input directory content and a MANIFEST.MF file, if present in the project."}
