This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. \n\nTo reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n   }\n}\n\n2. Compile using the following command:\n\najc -d subpackage\\Test.java\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nThe class files should be compiled correctly and placed in the 'subpackage' directory.\n\nObserved behavior:\n\nA new 'subpackage' directory is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.\n\nNote: This issue is not a big deal.", "OB": "A new 'subpackage' directory is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory.", "EB": "The class files should be compiled correctly and placed in the 'subpackage' directory.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1.
