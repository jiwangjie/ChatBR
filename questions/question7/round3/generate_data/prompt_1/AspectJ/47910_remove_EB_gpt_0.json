{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910 - ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When calling the ajc command with the 'outjar' parameter to create a jar file, it does not include the MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc suggests that the 'outjar' parameter should create a zip file, but in this case, it creates a file with a .jar extension. However, without the MANIFEST.MF file, the resulting file is not a valid jar file.", "OB": "I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' parameter, followed by 'outjar' and specify the output file as <my.jar>. The command successfully creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, when examining the resulting file, it does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "When I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' parameter, followed by 'outjar' and specify the output file as <my.jar>, I expect the resulting file to be a valid jar file that includes the MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir> outjar <my.jar>'.\n2. Verify that the output file <my.jar> is created.\n3. Verify that the output file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file."}
