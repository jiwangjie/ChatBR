This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac.I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlyingEclipse compiler.Create a class in a subpackage such as:package subpackage;public class Test {public static void main(String[] args) {System.out.println(\"Hello\");}}Then compile using following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.javaYou will see a directory \"subpackage\" created under the existing \"subpackage\"directory. subpackage\\Test.javaor javac subpackage\\Test.javaNo big deal, really. ", "OB": "When compiling a class in a subpackage using ajc command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that no additional \"subpackage\" directory should be created and the class file should be compiled directly under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, create a class in a subpackage, like \"package subpackage; public class Test {...}\", and compile it using the command \"ajc subpackage\\Test.java\". Verify that an additional \"subpackage\" directory is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory instead of the class file being compiled directly."}
