{"id": "47910", "title": "ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When running the ajc command with the options sourceroots <mydir, outjar <my.jar, the output file generated has a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for ajc mentions the option 'outjar <file' which implies that it should create a zip file, but it does not make sense to have a parameter called outjar that creates a zip file without a MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "When I run the ajc command with the sourceroots option and specify an output file with the outjar option, the command successfully creates a file with a .jar extension.", "EB": "However, the generated file is not a valid jar file because it is missing the MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, execute the ajc command with the arguments sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar and verify that the resultant output file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
