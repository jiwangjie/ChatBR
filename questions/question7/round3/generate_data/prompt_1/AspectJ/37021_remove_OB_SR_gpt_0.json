When targeting .class files from injars in declare warning messages, the source path is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" instead of \"app/Main.class\". To reproduce this issue, please follow the steps below: See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem. Please note that these tests may return false positives when detecting this error because filename checking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. It is observed that AJDT simply omits the source path if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "Currently, in declare warning messages, the source path for .class files from injars is listed as \"app.Main.class\".", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the source path for .class files from injars should be listed as \"app/Main.class\".", "SR": "1. Run the code provided in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. to see the problem.\n2. Observe that in declare warning messages, the source path for .class files from injars is listed as \"app.Main.class\".\n3. Expected results: The source path for .class files from injars should be listed as \"app/Main.class\"."}
