{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path displayed incorrectly in declare warning on binary files", "description": "When using declare warning messages to target .class files from injars, the source path is displayed incorrectly. The source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. This issue can be reproduced by running the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings' directory. It's worth noting that these tests may produce false positives because filename checking is not enabled during harness verification of messages. Additionally, in some cases, the filenames do not appear at all, but this problem is not reproducible using these tests.", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. I have also observed instances where the filenames do not appear, although these tests do not demonstrate this problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Run the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings' directory. \n2. Verify that the declare warning messages incorrectly display the source path as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."}
