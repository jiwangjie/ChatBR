{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The current behavior is that when using ajc to create a .jar file with the outjar option, the generated .jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. This is problematic because a .jar file without a manifest is not considered a valid JAR file.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the sourceroots option, pointing to a directory, and the outjar option, specifying a file name with a .jar extension, an output file is created. However, when I examine the generated file, it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "I expect that when I use ajc with the outjar option, the generated .jar file should contain a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, perform the following steps:\n1. Use the ajc compiler with the sourceroots option to specify a source directory.\n2. Include the outjar option in the command, specifying a file name with a .jar extension.\n3. Verify the contents of the generated .jar file and confirm that it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
