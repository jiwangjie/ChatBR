{"id": "49503", "title": "Bug 49503 - Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this issue supposedly affects version 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, which allows Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. This is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Boot.start() methods. The issue breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g. port 80). This issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that was applied in revision 957960. The second instance fails as expected, but not in the expected way.\n\n3. Actual behavior:\n\nThe exception does not occur because the connector does not attempt to bind to the port. It will bind when the start() method is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in Server.await().", "EB": "Expected behavior:\n\nI would expect that in the StandardService.initInternal() method, the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there, and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown. Then, it should be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.\n\n4.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n\n1. Start the first instance successfully.\n2.
