{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap load(String[]) and Bootstart start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce: 1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "The Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), causing Tomcat to fail to start correctly.", "EB": "The Connectors should bind to their ports in Catalina.load() and Tomcat should start successfully.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first instance of Tomcat successfully. Then, add the following line to conf/catalina.properties file: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
