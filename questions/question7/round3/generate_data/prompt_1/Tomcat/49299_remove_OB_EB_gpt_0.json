{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 discrepancy in custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "The description states that Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 mentions that a custom cookie name affects URL rewriting. However, in the current trunk, this is not the case as the default 'jsessionid' is used instead. The bug report includes a war file that demonstrates this issue.", "OB": "The Servlet 3.0 specification, specifically in ch.7.1.1, incorrectly states that a custom cookie name affects URL rewriting.", "EB": "The Servlet 3.0 specification should be amended to reflect the correct behavior that the default 'jsessionid' is always used for URL rewriting regardless of the custom cookie name.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Deploy the attached war file (cookiename.war). 2. Access the application at http://localhost:8080/cookiename/."}
