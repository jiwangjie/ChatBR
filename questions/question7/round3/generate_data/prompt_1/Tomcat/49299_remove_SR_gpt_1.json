The actual behavior does not align with the specified behavior.", "OB": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is stated that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled). However, the observed behavior is that the page sends a cookie with the following value: SetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. But the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid': http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp; jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "According to the specified behavior in 7.1.1, I would expect the Reload link to be: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp; MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F.", "SR": "1.
