{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying `<Server port=\"1\"` in the server.xml file of Tomcat, the Windows service works as expected, but it prints an error message. It is possible to improve the shutdown process of Tomcat, as currently using `System.exit(0)` works irrespective of the configuration. It is also possible that jsvc, a Java daemon launcher, exhibits the same behavior, although it has not been tested.", "OB": "When the Tomcat service is started and then stopped, an error message is printed.", "EB": "When the Tomcat service is started and then stopped, no error message should be printed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on a Windows system. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Attempt to shut down the server using an OS signal or by calling `Catalina.stop()`."}
