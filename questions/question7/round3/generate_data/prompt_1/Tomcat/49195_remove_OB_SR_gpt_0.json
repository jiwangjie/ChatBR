{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, the Windows service runs without any issues but displays an error message. It is worth noting that this behavior can help differentiate between two use cases. It may be beneficial to improve the shutdown process of Tomcat in order to work consistently regardless of the port value. It is also worth investigating if jsvc exhibits the same behavior, although this has not been tested.", "OB": "When running the Windows service with <Server port=\"1\", Tomcat functions as expected with no visible issues. However, it prints an error message in the console.", "EB": "When running the Windows service with <Server port=\"1\", Tomcat should function as expected with no visible issues. Additionally, it should not print any error messages in the console.", "SR": "1. Install Tomcat and configure the server.xml file with the following line: <Server port=\"1\". \n2. Start the Tomcat Windows service. \n3. Observe the behavior and verify that the service runs without any visible issues. \n4. Check the console to confirm that no error messages are displayed."}
