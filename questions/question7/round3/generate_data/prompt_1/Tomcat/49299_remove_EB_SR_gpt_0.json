{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299: Incorrect behavior regarding custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "The bug report discusses an issue mentioned in chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf. According to the spec, if a web application sets a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter when the session id is encoded in the URL, assuming URL rewriting is enabled. However, the observed behavior differs from the expected behavior. The page sets a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' and the expected behavior is to use the same custom name as the URI parameter instead of 'jsessionid' during URL rewriting. The attached 'cookiename.war' file demonstrates the problem.", "OB": "The page sets a cookie with the name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE', but during URL rewriting, instead of using the same custom name as the URI parameter, it uses 'jsessionid' as the name.", "EB": "When URL rewriting is enabled and a web application sets a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name should be used as the name of the URI parameter during URL rewriting.", "SR": "1. Deploy the 'cookiename.war' file on a server.\n2. Enable URL rewriting in the web application.\n3. Load the page that uses session tracking.\n4. Inspect the cookie set by the page and verify that it has the expected custom name.\n5. Click on the 'Reload' link and observe the URL to check if the custom name is used as the URI parameter instead of 'jsessionid' during URL rewriting."}
