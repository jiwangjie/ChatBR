That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that.I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: '27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServerSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' However, despite this error message, Tomcat is actually stopped successfully. After printing the message, Catalina.stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat getting shutdown. It should be noted that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Configure the server.xml file with <Server port=\"1\" to test the shutdown port functionality.2. Start the Tomcat Windows service.3. Monitor the catalina.20100427.log file for any error messages related to the shutdown port.4. Confirm that despite the error message mentioned above, the Tomcat server is successfully stopped when the service is launched."}
