{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195 - Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, Tomcat stops without any issues. However, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' This message appears to be inconsequential as Tomcat still shuts down properly. The issue may also occur when using jsvc, although this has not been confirmed.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log file: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.' Tomcat stops despite this error message. Additionally, when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the 'Catalinaserver' object is not null.", "EB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, no error message should be printed in the catalina.20100427.log file. Tomcat should stop without any issues.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the service. 3. Stop the service. 4. Manually shut down the server through an OS signal or by calling 'Catalina.stop()'. Note any error messages that are printed during this process."}
