{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name in URL rewriting", "description": "The chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf states that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL, provided that URL rewriting has been enabled. However, in the current trunk, the default 'jsessionid' is used instead of the custom name. This bug report includes a war file (cookiename.war) which reproduces the issue.", "OB": "When accessing the page at http://localhost:8080/cookiename/, the Set-Cookie header in the server's response includes a cookie with the following value: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. However, when clicking on the 'Reload' link on the page, the URL generated includes 'jsessionid' instead of the expected custom cookie name.", "EB": "The 'Reload' link on the page should use the custom cookie name (MYSESSIONCOOKIE) instead of 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:  1. Deploy the attached cookiename.war file.  2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/.  3. Click on the 'Reload' link on the page."}
