{"id": "7752", "title": "Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails", "description": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., \"foo.txt\").\n3. From the main menu, select File > Export and choose Zip File to export.\n4. In the \"Export\" dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (such as \"test.zip\"), and start the export.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up stating that problems were encountered during export, and the details specify that the file of the same name in project 2 is the problem.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe export process should complete successfully without any errors or issues, allowing all files with the same name in different directories to be included in the zip file.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nPlease follow the steps mentioned in the description to reproduce the issue."}
