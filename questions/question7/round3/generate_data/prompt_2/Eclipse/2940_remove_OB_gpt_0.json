Currently, there is no indication that the process is ongoing, which can cause confusion to the user.\n\nObserved Behavior:\nIt takes a long time (approximately 30 seconds in my case) to update the checked state of the table. However, no busy cursor is displayed, and the user may assume that nothing is happening.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nDuring the update of checkboxes in the export Zip feature, a busy cursor should be shown to indicate that the process is ongoing.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a workspace with many projects.\n2. Navigate to the export Zip feature.\n3. Select all projects.\n4. Choose the desired file types.\n5. Press the 'OK' button.\n\nNotes: None at this time."}
