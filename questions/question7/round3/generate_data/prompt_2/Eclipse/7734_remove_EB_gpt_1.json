{"id": "7734", "title": "System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. Currently, there is no warning or question message box to inform users about the unsaved changes and provide an opportunity to save. This can result in data loss. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook etc.) do provide such warnings before shutting down.", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows causes the loss of the changes in the .txt file.", "EB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file and the user attempts to shut down Windows, a warning or question message box should appear, giving the user a chance to save their unsaved changes in the .txt file.", "SR": "1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add some text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shutdown/reboot the computer.\n5. The expected behavior is for a warning or question message box to appear, asking the user to save their unsaved changes before shutting down the computer."}
