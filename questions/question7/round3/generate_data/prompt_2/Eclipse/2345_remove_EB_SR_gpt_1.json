Open a new basic project in the editor.\n2. Create a new file called test.xml in the project.\n3. The default editor used for XML files is the scripted resource editor example, which completely ignores the content of the XML file.\n4. In the Navigator, select test.xml.\n5. Right-click on test.xml and choose 'Open With...' -> 'Default Text Editor'.\n\nThe observed behavior is that nothing happens. It does not open a new editor for the file, but instead reactivates the scripted resource editor example that was already open for the file.\n\nI also noticed that searching for an existing open file should take into consideration the different types of editors. In this case, it should open a new editor for the file because the editor type is different.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
