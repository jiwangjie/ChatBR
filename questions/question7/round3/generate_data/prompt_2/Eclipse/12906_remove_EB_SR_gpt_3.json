However, when I right click on the Java file and select 'Open With .. System Editor', nothing happens. The workbench should display a warning message saying that there may be changes that could be overwritten and ask if I want to continue. Alternatively, an error message should be displayed indicating that I should close all other files first. We believe this is a safety feature where the editor does not allow external editing when a file is already opened within the editor.", "EB": "When I right click on the Java file and select 'Open With ..
