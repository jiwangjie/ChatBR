Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as 'foo.txt'). 3. From the main menu, select File -> Export and select 'Zip File' to export. 4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier, give the zip file a name (such as 'test.zip') and begin the export to zip file. Results: An error message box pops up, indicating that there were problems encountered during the export. The error message also points to the file with the same name in project 2 as the problem.", "OB": "When attempting to export multiple files with the same name, but located under different directories, to a zip file using WSWB, an error message box pops up during the export process.
