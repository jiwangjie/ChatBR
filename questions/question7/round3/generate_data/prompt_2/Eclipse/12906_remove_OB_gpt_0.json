However, there should be a warning or error message displayed when attempting to do so.", "OB": "When a file is already opened in one editor, attempting to open it in another editor does not result in any warning or error message.", "EB": "However, there should be a warning or error message displayed when attempting to open a file in another editor that is already opened in one editor.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Make sure you have an associate Windows editor for your java file.\n2. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n3. In the Java Perspective, right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the java file opened. Close it.\n4. Go to the Java Perspective and open a java file by simply double clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n5. Right click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. Note that nothing happens.\n\nThe expected behavior is that a warning message should be displayed stating that there may be changes to the file and asking if the user wants to continue, or an error message should be displayed stating that the file needs to be closed first before opening in another editor. We believe it's a safety feature where WSAD doesn't allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."}
