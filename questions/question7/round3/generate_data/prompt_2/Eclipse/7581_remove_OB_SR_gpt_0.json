{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com>, wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...", "OB": "There is no observed behavior described in the bug report.", "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. I also expected the combo box to work the same as DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. Currently, the combo box is not sized correctly in the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Use a ComboBoxCellEditor for a property.\n3. Observe that the combo box does not adjust its width to match the property sheet column width.\n4. Compare this behavior with DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible."}
