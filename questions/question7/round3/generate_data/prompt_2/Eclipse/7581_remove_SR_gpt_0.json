", "OB": "When using the ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet, the combo box does not size correctly.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box to always be the same width as the property sheet column. Currently, it does not behave the same way as DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. We need to investigate whether this is our issue or a problem with SWT.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet that contains the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n2. Observe that the combo box does not adjust its width to match the property sheet column.\n3. Compare this behavior with the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible and adjusts correctly.\n4. Investigate if this is an issue with our implementation or with SWT."}
