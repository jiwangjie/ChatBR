{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\nThe PropertySheetViewer lets me edit objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include ComboBoxCellEditor constructor of which can be given the strings. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet and the drop down button appears at the right edge of the column.\n\nA problem occurs if any of my strings is wider than the width of the property sheet column. It appears that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. The problem is that the drop down button may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet so it is clipped. From a user experience, they can no longer see the combo drop down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "It seems that when using a ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet, if any of the strings in the combo box options is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the width of the combo box automatically expands to fit the widest option. As a result, the drop down button may extend beyond the visible area of the property sheet and get clipped.", "EB": "I would expect the combo box in the property sheet to always be the width of the property sheet column. Regardless of the width of the options in the combo box, the drop down button should always remain visible within the property sheet.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Edit an object with a ComboBoxCellEditor in column two.\n3. Ensure that one or more of the options in the combo box are wider than the width of the property sheet column.\n4. Observe that the combo box expands to fit the widest option and the drop down button may be off the visible area of the property sheet."}
