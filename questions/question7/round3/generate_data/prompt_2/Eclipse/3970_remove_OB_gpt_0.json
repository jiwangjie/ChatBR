{"id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970 - UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files", "description": "Bug 3970 - The Windows work stations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PCs are cheaper than Unix boxes). Currently, when a new file is created on Windows, it does not have Unix line delimiters, which is problematic because the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) available to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. This UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure consistency in the line delimiter usage across all plugins. Notes:", "OB": "The new files created on Windows have line delimiters that are specific to the Windows platform (e.g., \r\n) instead of having Unix line delimiters (e.g., \n).", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow this scenario: Use both Unix and Windows workstations to develop a Unix product/program."}
