Instead, a warning message or error message should be displayed, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue. This behavior is believed to be a safety feature in WSAD that does not allow external editing when a file is already open in WSAD.", "OB": "1. Open a file in WSAD.\n2. Switch to the Java Perspective.\n3. Double click on a Java file to open it in the workbench.\n4. Right click on the same Java file.\n5. Select 'Open With' > 'System Editor'.\n6. Observe that nothing happens.\n\nExpected Result: The workbench should display a warning message or error message, informing the user that they may overwrite changes and asking if they want to continue editing the file in the new editor.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
