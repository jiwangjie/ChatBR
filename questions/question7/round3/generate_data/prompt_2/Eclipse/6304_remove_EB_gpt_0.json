{"id": "6304", "title": "Cannot synchronize a .java file and another resource", "description": "When trying to synchronize a .java file with another resource, such as a .properties file, in the package viewer, the synchronization fails.", "OB": "When attempting to synchronize a .java file and another resource, the synchronization process fails. The files are not synchronized and any changes made to one file are not reflected in the other.", "EB": "When synchronizing a .java file and another resource, such as a .properties file, both files should be synchronized properly. Any changes made to one file should be automatically reflected in the other.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Open the package viewer. 2. Select a .java file and another resource file (e.g., a .properties file) located in the same package. 3. Attempt to synchronize the two files. 4. Observe that the synchronization fails and changes made to one file are not reflected in the other."}
