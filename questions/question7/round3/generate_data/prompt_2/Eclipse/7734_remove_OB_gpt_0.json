{"id": "7734", "title": "Bug 7734: System can be shut down without savefile warnings", "description": "", "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately.", "EB": "The system should provide a 'Do you want to save your file' dialog box with options for 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel'. Selecting 'Yes' would save the file, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would halt the shutdown and allow the user to continue using the system. This dialog box should be displayed when attempting to shut down or reboot the computer while there are unsaved changes in the WSWB session.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Verify that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu and select the 'Shut Down' command to shut down/reboot the computer.\n\nExpected results:\n\nA 'Do you want to save your file' dialog box should be displayed, giving the user a chance to save their dirty model(s) before proceeding with the shutdown. The dialog box should provide options for 'Yes' (to save the file), 'No' (to discard the changes), and 'Cancel' (to halt the shutdown and allow the user to continue using the system)."}
