{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...\n\nThe PropertySheetViewer allows me to edit objects using a set of rows that are name-value pairs displayed in two columns. Each column is defined by an IPropertyDescriptor. I use the 'create cell editor' method of IPropertyDescriptor to create editors that include ComboBoxCellEditor. The constructor of ComboBoxCellEditor can be provided with a list of strings.\n\nThe problem is that when the editor is displayed in column two of the property sheet, the dropdown button appears at the right edge of the column and is clipped if any of the strings is wider than the width of the column. As a result, users cannot see the dropdown button without widening the property sheet view until the button comes into the visible area.", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in the property sheet. If any of the strings in the dropdown list is wider than the column width, the dropdown button is clipped and cannot be seen without widening the property sheet view.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Open the property sheet.\n2. Create or select an object that has a property requiring a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Make one of the strings in the dropdown list wider than the width of the column.\n4. Observe that the dropdown button is clipped and cannot be seen without widening the property sheet view."}
