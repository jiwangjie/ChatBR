Create a new basic project\n2. Create a new file 'test.xml'\n3. The editor used is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content\n4. Select 'test.xml' in Navigator\n5. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'\n\nAfter step 5, nothing happens; it simply reactivates the scripted resource editor example. This means selecting 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' does not have any effect when the file is already open in a different type of editor. \nSearching for an existing open file should also consider the type of editor.\n\nMoreover, it should open a new editor on the file because the selected editor type is different.\n\nNOTES: ", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
