", "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet does not size correctly. If any of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. As a result, the drop-down button may be clipped off and not visible within the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor in the property sheet should size correctly and ensure that the drop-down button is always visible within the property sheet.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer. \n2. Edit an object using a row that contains a name-value pair in two columns. \n3. Create an IPropertyDescriptor and use its method to create a ComboBoxCellEditor. \n4. Set the ComboBoxCellEditor to appear in column two of the property sheet. \n5. Ensure that one of the strings in the ComboBoxCellEditor is wider than the width of the property sheet column. \n6. Observe that the drop-down button of the ComboBoxCellEditor may not be visible and is clipped off from the visible area of the property sheet."}
