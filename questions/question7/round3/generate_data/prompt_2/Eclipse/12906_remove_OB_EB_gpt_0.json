No warning or error message is displayed.", "EB": "When a file is already opened in one editor and an attempt is made to open it in another editor, a warning or error message should be displayed. The message should inform the user that they may overwrite changes and ask if they want to continue, or it should inform the user that all files need to be closed first before proceeding.", "SR": "1. Make sure you have an associate Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double-click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'. A Notepad or WordPad window will pop up with the Java file opened. Close it.\n3. Go back to the Java Perspective and open a Java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe workbench should display a warning message informing the user that they may overwrite changes and ask if they want to continue, or an error message stating that all files need to be closed first.\n\nNote: This behavior is believed to be a safety feature where the WSAD (WebSphere Studio Application Developer) does not allow external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD."}
