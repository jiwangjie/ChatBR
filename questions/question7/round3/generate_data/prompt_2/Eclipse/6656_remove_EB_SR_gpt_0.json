However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move down. This can potentially confuse users if the icons keep moving around.", "OB": "The close button moves down when the Navigator view is resized smaller.", "EB": "The close button should remain in the same position when the Navigator view is resized smaller.", "SR": "1. Launch build 20011127 on linux.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the view to be smaller.\n4. Observe the position of the close button."}
