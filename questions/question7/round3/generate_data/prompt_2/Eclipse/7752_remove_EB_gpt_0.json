Launch WSWB and create two projects. \n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt'). \n3. From the main menu, select File -> Export and choose 'Zip File' to export. \n4. In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier, provide a name for the zip file (e.g., 'test.zip'), and click 'Export'. \n\nObserved behavior: \nExporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails. An error message box pops up indicating that problems were encountered during export, and the detailed error message lists the file with the same name in project2 as the problem. \n\nExpected behavior: \nThe export process should successfully create a zip file containing all the selected projects and their respective files, even if they have the same name. \n\nSteps to reproduce: \n1.
