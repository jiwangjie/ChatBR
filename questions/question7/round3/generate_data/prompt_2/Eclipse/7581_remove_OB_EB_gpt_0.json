{"id": "7581", "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet", "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in message... (description continues)", "OB": "When using the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects in a property sheet, the ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly when the strings in the combo box are wider than the width of the property sheet column. The combo box grows to be the width of the largest item, causing the drop down button to be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet.", "EB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor should size correctly in the property sheet, ensuring that the drop down button is visible even when the strings in the combo box are wider than the column width.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the PropertySheetViewer.\n2. Create a property sheet with a column containing ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Add strings to the combo box that are wider than the width of the column.\n4. Observe that the drop down button is not visible within the property sheet due to being clipped off.\nExpected behavior: The drop down button should be visible within the property sheet, even when the strings in the combo box are wider than the column width."}
