If you select test.xml in the Navigator and choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor', nothing happens. The existing scripted resource editor example remains active and does not switch to the default text editor.", "EB": "When following the steps in 1GEWMOZ, selecting a file in the Navigator and choosing 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' should open a new editor for the file, even if it is already open. The new editor should be the default text editor because the file type is different. Currently, selecting 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' does not cause any action, and the existing editor remains active.", "SR": "1. Create a new basic project\n2. Create a new file named test.xml\n3. The scripted resource editor example should be the default editor for XML files\n4. In the Navigator, select test.xml\n5. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor'\n6. Verify that a new editor for the file opens and that it is the default text editor\n\nNOTES: Searching for an existing open file should also consider editor types. The expected behavior is for a new editor to open on the file, even if it is already open, and the type of editor should match the file type."}
