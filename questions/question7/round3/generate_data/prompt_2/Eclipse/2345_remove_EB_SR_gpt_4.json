However, when selecting the file 'test.xml' in the Navigator and choosing 'Open With... / Default Text Editor', nothing happens and the scripted resource editor example is reactivated instead. It seems that searching for an existing open file does not consider editor types. The file 'test.xml' should open in a new editor, since the editor type is different.", "EB": "When selecting 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' for the file 'test.xml' in the Navigator, a new editor should open and display the content of the file.", "SR": "1.
