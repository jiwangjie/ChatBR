Close the file if it is already opened in an editor.\n2. Switch to the Java Perspective.\n3. Double click on a Java file to open it in the workbench.\n4. Right click on the same Java file.\n5. Select 'Open With' -> 'System Editor'.\n6. Observe that nothing happens.\n\nThe workbench should display a warning message indicating that opening the file in another editor may result in overwriting changes and asking the user if they want to continue, or display an error message stating that all files need to be closed first.\n\nWe believe this is a safety feature in WSAD that prevents external editing while the file is already opened in WSAD.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
