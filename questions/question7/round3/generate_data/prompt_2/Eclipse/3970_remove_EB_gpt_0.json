However, this may not always be what a user wants.", "EB": "A user-friendly UI should be implemented to allow the user to define the default line delimiters for new files.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use a Unix and Windows workstation to develop a Unix product or program.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Observe that the line delimiter used is based on System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\").\n4. Verify that there is currently no way to define the default line delimiters for new files."}
