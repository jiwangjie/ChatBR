{"id": "7785", "title": "Bug 7785: SaveAs Forgets the File Type", "description": "When using the SaveAs functionality, the file type is not remembered. Additionally, the icon for the file has changed from the original Java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "After performing a SaveAs operation, the file is saved with a generic file extension. When opened, the file is displayed as plain text.", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file, unless explicitly changed. The file should open with the appropriate application or be displayed with the correct icon.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the parent Java file.\n2. Go to the SaveAs option.\n3. Select a new location and provide a new name for the file.\n4. Verify that the file is saved with a generic file extension and the Java file icon is replaced with a generic file icon.\n5. Open the file and observe that it is displayed as plain text."}
