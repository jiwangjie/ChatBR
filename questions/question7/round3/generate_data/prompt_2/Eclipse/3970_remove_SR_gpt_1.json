However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "The new files should have Unix line delimiters, even if they are created on Windows, since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter. All plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": "1. Open Eclipse on a Windows workstation.\n2. Create a new file.\n3. Check the line delimiter used for the new file.\n4. Open the Preferences menu.\n5. Look for the option to define the default line delimiter for new files.\n6. Verify that the possible values include Dos/Windows, Mac, Unix, and the default platform line delimiter.\n7. Change the line delimiter preference.\n8. Create a new file.\n9. Verify that the new file has the line delimiter according to the preference set."}
