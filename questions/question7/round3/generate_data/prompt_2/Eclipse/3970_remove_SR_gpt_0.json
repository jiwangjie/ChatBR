", "OB": "When creating a new file, the line delimiter returned from System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\") is used. However, this may not always be what the user wants.", "EB": "Even if the new file is created on Windows, it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product. There should be a UI (Preference) provided by the Workbench to allow users to define the line delimiter for new files. The possible values should include Dos / Windows, Mac, Unix default, and the platform line delimiter. This UI should be provided by the Workbench to ensure all plugins use the same line delimiter for new files.", "SR": ""}
