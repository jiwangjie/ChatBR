The icon has also changed from the parent java file icon to a generic file icon.", "OB": "1. Open an existing java file.\n2. Modify the java file (e.g., move an existing class).\n3. Click the SaveAs icon next to the Save Icon. A dialog box will appear.\n4. Browse for a valid container location.\n5. Type the filename without including the extension (since it is not requested).\n6. Click OK.\n\nObserved Behavior: The file is saved in the specified location, but the file extension is not shown in the Navigator. The file is now displayed with a generic file icon.\n", "EB": "The file should be saved with the same extension as the original file unless explicitly changed during the SaveAs operation. Opening the file should also confirm that it is still a Java file and not just plain text.", "SR": "1. Open an existing java file.\n2. Modify the java file (e.g., move an existing class).\n3. Click the SaveAs icon next to the Save Icon.\n4. In the Save As dialog, browse for a valid container location.\n5. Type the filename without including the extension.\n6. Click OK.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe file should be saved in the specified location with the same extension as the original file. When opened, it should still be recognized as a Java file."}
