There should be a warning message indicating that I may overwrite changes and asking if I want to continue, or an error message stating that I should close all files first. We believe this behavior is a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double click on any java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right click on the java file and choose 'Open With' > 'System Editor'.\n3. The workbench should display a warning message indicating that you may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue, or an error message stating that you should close all files first.\n\nNote: If the expected behavior is not observed, please double check that the file is already opened in the workbench before performing step 3."}
