To reproduce the issue, refer to the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. folder. Please note that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It seems that AJDT omits the filename if it doesn't make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages for .class files from injars should be displayed as 'app/Main.class'", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the declare warning message for a .class file from injars.\n2. Observe that the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'."}
