See tests/new/binaryWarnings/ for code to reproduce the problem. These tests have limitations and may produce false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. (In AJDT, the filename may be omitted if it is meaningless to AJDT.)", "OB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'. In some cases, the file names do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/. The declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should list the source path in the form 'app/Main.class' instead of 'app.Main.class'."}
