The problem can be observed by running the code provided in the 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/' directory. However, note that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. In cases where the filename does not make sense to AJDT, it may be omitted from the declare warning message.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes, the filenames do not appear at all but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "When targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "SR": ""}
