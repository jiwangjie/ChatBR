I am using ajc 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a class in a subpackage like this:\n   \n   package subpackage;\n   \n   public class Test {\n       \n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nAfter compiling, only the class file should be created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nObserved Behavior:\n\nInstead, a new directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nThis behavior is not consistent with javac.\n\nThis is not a critical issue, but it should be addressed to maintain consistency.\n", "OB": "Instead, a new directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory", "EB": "After compiling, only the class file should be created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory", "SR": "Create a class in a subpackage, compile it using the ajc command with the -d option, and observe that only the class file is created under the subpackage directory without creating a new subpackage directory."}
