{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter compiling, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory. The compiled Test.class file is placed in the subpackage\\subpackage directory.\n\nWhen running the Java command, the following exception is thrown:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nExpected Behavior:\nRunning either of the following commands should fix the problem:\n- ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n- javac subpackage\\Test.java"}
