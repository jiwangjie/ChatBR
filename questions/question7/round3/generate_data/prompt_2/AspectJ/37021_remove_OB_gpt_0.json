The issue can be reproduced by running the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. It is important to note that these tests may produce false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. Additionally, it seems that AJDT omits the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "The source path in declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, is listed in the format 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "The expected behavior is for the source path in declare warning messages, when targeting .class files from injars, to be listed in the format 'app/Main'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Run the code in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ directory. 2. Observe the source path listed in the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars."}
