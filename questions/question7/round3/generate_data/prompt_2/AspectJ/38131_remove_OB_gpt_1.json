{"id": "38131", "title": "ajc needs -d option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using version 1.1rc1 of ajc. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have something to do with a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n   package subpackage;\n\n   public class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n       }\n   }\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:", "OB": "A directory named 'subpackage' is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory when compiling the class with ajc.", "EB": "However, the expected behavior is that the compiled class should be placed in the 'subpackage' directory without creating an additional 'subpackage' directory.", "SR": "To fix this behavior, ajc should be updated to include the '-d' option when compiling classes from a subpackage."}
