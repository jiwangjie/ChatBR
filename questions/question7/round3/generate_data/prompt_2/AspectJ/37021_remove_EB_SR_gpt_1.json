The issue can be replicated by running the code provided in tests/new/binaryWarnings/ folder. However, please note that these tests may give false positives due to disabled filename checking in harness verification of messages. It seems that AJDT omits the filename if it does not make sense to AJDT.", "OB": "In declare warning messages that target .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. There are cases where the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
