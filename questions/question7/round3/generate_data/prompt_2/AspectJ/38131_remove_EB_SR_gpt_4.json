{"id": "38131", "title": "Bug 38131: ajc needs -d . option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage", "description": "I am using 1.1rc1. This bug is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I suspect it may be related to a change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, for example:\n\npackage subpackage;\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    }\n}\n\n2. Compile the class using the following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.java\n\nObserved Behavior:\nAfter executing the command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created within the existing \"subpackage\" directory. The compiled class file (Test.class) is placed within this new subpackage directory.\nAttempting to run the compiled class using the 'java' command results in the following error:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test\n\nExpected Behavior:\nRunning either of the following commands should fix the problem:\n- ajc -d . subpackage\\Test.java\n- javac subpackage\\Test.java\n\nThis bug is not a major issue, but it should be addressed for consistency with the behavior of javac.", "OB": "After executing the 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java' command, a directory named \"subpackage\" is created within the existing \"subpackage\" directory.
