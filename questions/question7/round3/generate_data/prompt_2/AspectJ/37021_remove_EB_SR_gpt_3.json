{"id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files", "description": "Bug 37021 - Source path incorrect in declare warning on binary files. When targeting .class files from injars in declare warning messages, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Sometimes, the filenames do not appear at all in the messages as well. This issue can be observed when running the code found in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'. However, it's important to note that these tests may also return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It seems that AJDT simply omits the filename if it doesn't make sense to it.", "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars in declare warning messages, the source path appears as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "The source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars should be listed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.

Observe the declare warning messages and note that the source path appears as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.\n3. Additionally, verify if the filenames consistently appear in the messages."}
