To reproduce the issue, please refer to the code located in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. directory. It should be noted that these tests have limitations and may result in false positives as filename checking is not enabled in the harness verification of messages. (This issue was observed in AJDT, where the filename that does not make sense to AJDT is simply omitted.)", "OB": "There is currently an issue with the declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars. The source path is displayed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'.", "EB": "The declare warning messages should display the source path in the format 'app/Main' when targeting .class files from injars.", "SR": "1. Open the code located in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. directory.\n2. Compile the code to generate the .class files.\n3. Run the application.\n4. Check the declare warning messages for the source path format."}
