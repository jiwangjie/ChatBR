{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "The ajc command is supposed to create a jar file with the specified output name, but it does not include the MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation suggests that the output should be a zip file, but it does not make sense to use a parameter called 'outjar' if it doesn't create a valid jar file.", "OB": "When I call ajc with the 'sourceroots' flag and specify an output jar file using the 'outjar' flag, the output file is created with a .jar extension. However, the generated file does not include a MANIFEST.MF file.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when I use the 'outjar' flag, the generated jar file should include a MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, execute the following command: ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar. After the command completes, verify that the <my.jar file does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file."}
