To reproduce the issue, please run the code found in tests/new/binaryWarnings/. Note that these tests may return false positives due to the lack of filename checking in harness verification of messages. It seems that in AJDT, if the filename does not make sense, it is simply omitted.", "OB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is shown as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'. Additionally, sometimes the filenames do not appear at all, although these tests do not reproduce that specific problem.", "EB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be displayed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.", "SR": "1. Run the code located in tests/new/binaryWarnings/.\n2. Verify that the declare warning messages for .class files from injars display the source path as 'app/Main'.\n3. Also, check if any declare warning messages do not display the filenames at all."}
