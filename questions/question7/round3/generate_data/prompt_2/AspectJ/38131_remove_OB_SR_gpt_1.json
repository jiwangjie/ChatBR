This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying Eclipse compiler.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a class in a subpackage such as:\n\npackage subpackage;\n\npublic class Test {\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");\n}\n\n}\n\n2. Compile using the following command: ajc -d subpackage\\ Test.java\n\nExpected Result: The compiled file should be placed in the existing \"subpackage\" directory.\n\nObserved Result: A new \"subpackage\" directory is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory, and the compiled file is placed inside it.\n\nIt would be nice to have the same behavior as javac.", "OB": "A new \"subpackage\" directory is created under the existing \"subpackage\" directory, and the compiled file is placed inside it.", "EB": "The compiled file should be placed in the existing \"subpackage\" directory.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:\n\n1.
