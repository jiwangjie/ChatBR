{"id": "47910", "title": "Bug 47910: ajc outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF", "description": "When using ajc to compile source roots and create an output jar file, the resulting jar file does not contain the expected MANIFEST.MF file.", "OB": "I call ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar and an output file is created with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because there is no MANIFEST.MF file. The ajc documentation suggests that 'outjar' should create a zip file, but it doesn't make sense to create a zip file when expecting a jar file.", "EB": "If outjar is used, the resulting file should be a valid jar file, which means it should include the necessary MANIFEST.MF file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Run ajc with the 'sourceroots' option and specify the source directory\n2. Use the 'outjar' option to specify the output jar file name\n3. Verify that the resulting jar file does not contain the MANIFEST.MF file"}
