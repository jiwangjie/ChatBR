Integration build 09/17. This issue affects all motif platforms. On Windows, the page appears fine. However, on motif platforms such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders that indicate them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more prominently.", "OB": "On motif platforms (Solaris, AIX, HPUX), the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders that identify them as user input targets.
