This line of code is causing a problem in the CLDC version of SWT because it throws a NoClassDefFoundError, which is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. Only users who verified or used jxeLink or similar tools would encounter this issue, as the compiler generates the call itself and assumes NoClassDefFoundError is available.", "EB": "The problematic line of code needs to be changed to use the new keyword and getClass() method to obtain the class of the BidiUtil instance, like this: static Callback callback = new Callback(new BidiUtil().getClass(), \"windowProc\", 4);", "SR": "Change the line mentioned above to the new code snippet provided. Although the code change is untested, it is expected to function the same way and resolve the issue."}
