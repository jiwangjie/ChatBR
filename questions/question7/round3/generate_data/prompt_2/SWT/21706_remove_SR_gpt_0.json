{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 version has a usage of Class.forName() which causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT. This bug report is requesting to remove the reflection and add a private constructor to prevent instantiating the class. Currently, there are no non-static methods in this class, so making the constructor private would be a good improvement and won't add any extra size.", "OB": "In the org.eclipse.swt.internal.BidiUtil class, there is a line that uses Class.forName() to create a Callback object. This line throws a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT because it is not defined in the CLDC class libraries.", "EB": "To fix this issue, it is suggested to add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, making the constructor private would be a good practice to prevent unnecessary instantiation of the class. Adding a private constructor won't increase the size of the class as the compiler already provides a free public constructor.", "SR": ""}
