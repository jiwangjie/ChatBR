Create a StyledText widget in word wrap mode.\n2. Append N lines of text to the StyledText.\n3. Observe the multiple redraws of the entire client area.\n\nTo verify the fix, add the following line to the performPaint method of StyledText:\nSystem.out.println(\"lineCount \" + lineCount + \", paintY \" + paintY + \", renderHeight \" + renderHeight); Then perform the above steps again and ensure that only a single redraw of the modified portion of the client area occurs."}
