The current design of the Project Properties Info page is causing issues on motif platforms. On Windows, the design looks fine. However, on motif platforms such as Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, the text fields are getting automatic borders, which incorrectly identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris, AIX, and HPUX, the fields have different colored backgrounds, making them stand out even more.", "OB": "On Windows, the Project Properties Info page displays properly without any issues.
