This results in multiple unnecessary redraws for each visible line of text, leading to decreased performance.", "OB": "Currently, when changing the text in a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled, the widget performs multiple redraws for each visible line of text. This can be observed when running the test case below.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that there should be a maximum of one redraw for each visible line of text when making changes to the text in a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a StyledText widget with word wrap enabled.\n2. Add a large amount of text to the widget so that it extends beyond the visible area.\n3. Make a change to the text, such as adding or deleting characters.\n4. Observe the number of redraws that occur during the text change. There should be multiple redraws for each visible line of text instead of just one."}
