{"id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When the attached code is run in build 20020920, the left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux.", "EB": "When the attached code is run in build 20020920, the right tree and text should behave consistently with the left tree and text on Windows and Linux.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, click anywhere in the tree. The tree should lose focus, but it retains focus instead."}
