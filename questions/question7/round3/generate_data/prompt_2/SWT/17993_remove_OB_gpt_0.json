{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to autocomplete which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full autocomplete feature could be provided.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches and retrieves entries from previous searches and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history. For example, if I search for 'hello' and replace it with 'hi', and then try to search for 'Hello' and replace it with 'Hi', it is not possible. The application does not respect the case of what the user types.", "EB": "The behavior should be changed to something more simple that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. The feature should respect the case of what the user types. Until then, the feature should be removed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document so that the 'Edit' -> 'Find/Replace...' option becomes available. You should be able to access it.\n2. In the 'Find' field, type 'a'.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field. The application should not replace what is typed with a value from the history."}
