{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", "description": "It would be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history. The current behavior seems to be similar to 'autocomplete' which is particularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be provided.", "OB": "In the F1 build, when using the Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit -> Find/Replace...), if there are previous searches in the history, typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields causes it to search for entries from a previous search. If it finds a match, it replaces the typed entry with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, resulting in the case of what I have typed being changed to the case of the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "For me, it is very common to perform find and replace operations like this. I believe the current behavior should be changed to something more simple that allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed, while still respecting the case of what the user types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed. ", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document in the application.\n2. Go to Edit -> Find/Replace... and try to perform a find or replace operation. You will observe that it is not possible to perform the operation, and the behavior is the same for the 'Replace With' field."}
