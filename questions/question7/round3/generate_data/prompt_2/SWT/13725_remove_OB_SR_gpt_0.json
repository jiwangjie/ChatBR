", "OB": "Currently, when attempting to revert a file in the Java editor, the operation takes much longer compared to closing and reopening the file.", "EB": "This behavior is unexpected, as reverting a file should not take more time than simply closing and reopening it.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open a Java file in the editor. \n2. Make some changes to the file. \n3. Click on the 'Revert' option in the editor. \n4. Observe the time it takes for the file to be reverted. \n5. Close the file and reopen it. \n6. Observe the time it takes to close and reopen the file. \n7. Compare the time taken for reverting and closing/reopening the file."}
