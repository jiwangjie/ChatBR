{"id": "12398", "title": "Accessibility problems in Help view", "description": "When launching the Help view, I am required to first click on one of the 'live' areas (such as the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame or the content frame) before it starts working. This poses an accessibility problem as the tab key does not function when initially opening the Help view.", "OB": "When I launch the Help view on March 26th, 2002 on Windows 2000, the tab key does not perform any action.", "EB": "The Help view should be initiated in a way that allows immediate keyboard navigation.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the Help view. \n2. Observe that the tab key does not have any effect. \n3. Click on one of the 'live' areas (e.g., the banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame or the content frame) and verify that the tab key now works as expected."}
