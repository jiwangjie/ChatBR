However, we should improve the accessibility by starting the Help view in a way that can be immediately navigated via the keyboard.", "OB": "Currently, the Help view requires users to first click on an interactive area before it becomes accessible via the keyboard.", "EB": "The Help view should be accessible via the keyboard immediately upon opening.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Launch the application.\n2. Open the Help view.\n3. Attempt to navigate through the Help view using only the keyboard.
