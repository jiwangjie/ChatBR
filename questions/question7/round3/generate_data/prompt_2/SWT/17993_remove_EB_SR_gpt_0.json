{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. Currently, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if a previous search entry is found in the history, it replaces what has been typed with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in browsers. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced by the value from the history, to avoid confusion and allow for easier find/replace operations. In the future, a full 'autocomplete' feature could be considered. ", "OB": "The Find/Replace dialog in the F1 build automatically replaces the typed entry with a value from the history if a match is found. This includes changing the case of the typed entry to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
