The purpose of this bug report is to add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class. Currently, there are no non-static methods in this class, so it would be a good idea to prevent people from instantiating the class if there's no need to. This will not increase the size, as the compiler already provides a free public constructor. Instead, the goal is to make the constructor private instead of public.", "OB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 does not have a private constructor.", "EB": "The BidiUtil class in win32 should have a private constructor.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the BidiUtil class in win32. \n2. Check if a private constructor is present. \n3. If not, manually add a private constructor to the class. \n4. Save and compile the class. \n5. Verify that the BidiUtil class now has a private constructor."}
