{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993 - Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The Find/Replace feature in the F1 build has a history of recent searches. When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the feature searches for entries from previous searches. If it finds a matching entry, it replaces what is typed with the value from the history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete in web browsers. However, this behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations in some scenarios. It would be better if the typed entry is not automatically replaced with a value from the history. In the future, a full autocomplete feature could be considered.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, if there is a matching entry from the history, the typed entry is replaced with the value from the history. The search of the history is case-insensitive, which means that the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history. This behavior makes it impossible to perform find or replace operations in certain scenarios.", "EB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the typed entry should not be automatically replaced with a value from the history. The user's input should be preserved exactly as entered.", "SR": "1. Open the application 2. Choose Edit > Find/Replace... 3. Type 'hello' into the 'Find' field and 'hi' into the 'Replace With' field 4. Click 'Find' 5. Try to type 'Hello' into the 'Find' field 6. Observe that the typed entry is automatically replaced with 'hello', making it impossible to find or replace 'Hello'"}
