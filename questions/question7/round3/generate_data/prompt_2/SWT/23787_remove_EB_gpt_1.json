Integration build 09/17. On motif platforms, the text fields in the Info page of the Project Properties dialog present some issues. On Windows, they appear fine, but on motif platforms, these text fields display automatic borders, making them visually look like user input fields. In addition, on platforms like Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Info page of the Project Properties dialog have automatic borders and on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, they have different colored backgrounds.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1.
