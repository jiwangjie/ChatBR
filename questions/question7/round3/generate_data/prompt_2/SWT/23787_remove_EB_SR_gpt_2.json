The current implementation looks fine on Windows, but on motif platforms (e.g. Solaris, AIX, HPUX), these text fields all get automatic borders, which identify them as user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out worse.\n\n", "OB": "On motif platforms (e.g. Solaris, AIX, HPUX), the text fields in the Info page of the Project Properties dialog have automatic borders, making them look like user input targets.
