Looks bad on all motif platforms.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields in the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, which make them look like user input fields. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX, these text fields have different colored backgrounds, which make them stand out even more.", "EB": "The text fields in the Project Properties Info page should be created as readonly text fields instead of input fields. This way, their values can still be selected and copied by the user, but they won't look like editable fields.", "SR": "1. Open the Project Properties dialog on any motif platform.\n2. Go to the Info page.\n3. Observe the text fields and their appearance.\n"}
