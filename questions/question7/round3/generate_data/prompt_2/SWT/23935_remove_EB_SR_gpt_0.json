{"id": "23935", "title": "Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.", "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus. On Linux, the text widget does not lose focus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree. This behavior causes platform UI bug 2470.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the text widget loses focus when clicking on the tree on Linux, similar to how it works on Windows.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Open the application with the tree and the associated text widget on Linux. 2. Click anywhere in the tree. 3. Observe that the text widget does not lose focus even when clicking on the tree."}
