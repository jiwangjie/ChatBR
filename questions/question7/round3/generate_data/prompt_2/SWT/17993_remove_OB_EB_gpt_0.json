{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "The current behavior of the Find/Replace feature is replacing what the user types with a value from the search history. This behavior is similar to autocomplete, which is commonly seen in browsers. However, it would be better if the user's typed entry is not replaced with a value from the history. In the future, it would be useful to have a full autocomplete feature.", "OB": "When typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the application searches for entries from a previous search and replaces the user's typed entry with a matching value from the history.", "EB": "The application should not replace the user's typed entry with a value from the search history when using the Find/Replace feature.", "SR": "1. Open the application and choose Edit > Find/Replace...\n2. Type 'a' into the Find field.\n3. Click 'Find'.\n4. Try to type 'A' into the Find field. The application should not replace the 'A' with a value from the search history."}
