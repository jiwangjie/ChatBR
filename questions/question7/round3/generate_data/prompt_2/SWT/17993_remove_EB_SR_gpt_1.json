{"id": "17993", "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace replaces typed entry with value from history", "description": "When using the F1 build, the Find/Replace dialog accessed through Edit > Find/Replace... has a history of recent searches. The issue is that when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the search automatically looks for entries from a previous search and replaces the typed entry with a value from the history. This history search is case-insensitive, so the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value from the history. This behavior can make it impossible to perform find or replace operations.", "OB": "In the Find/Replace dialog, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the search automatically replaces the typed entry with a value from the history if it matches. The search is case-insensitive, so the case of the typed entry may be changed to match the case of the value in the history.", "EB": "The typed entry in the Find/Replace fields should not be replaced with a value from the history. Instead, the typed entry should remain as is, allowing users to perform find or replace operations without interference from the history.", "SR": "1. Open the Find/Replace dialog by clicking on Edit > Find/Replace...\n2. Type in a value in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields.\n3. Observe if the typed entry is automatically replaced with a value from the history.\n4. Try performing find and replace operations to see if the behavior of replacing typed entries with values from the history affects the functionality of the Find/Replace feature."}
