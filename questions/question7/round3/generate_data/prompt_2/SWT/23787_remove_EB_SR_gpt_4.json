Integration build 09/17. The current design of the Project Properties Info page is causing issues on motif platforms. On Windows, the page appears fine. However, on motif platforms, the text fields on the page have automatic borders, which make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, these text fields have different colored backgrounds, which makes them stand out even more.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields on the Project Properties Info page have automatic borders, indicating them as user input targets.
