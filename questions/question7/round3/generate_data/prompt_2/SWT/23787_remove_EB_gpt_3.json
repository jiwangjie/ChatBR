Integration build 09/17. The appearance of the text fields on the Info page is not consistent across different platforms. On motif platforms, the text fields have automatic borders which make them look like user input targets. Additionally, on Solaris/AIX/HPUX platforms, the text fields have different colored backgrounds which make them stand out in a visually unappealing way.", "OB": "On motif platforms, the text fields on the Info page have automatic borders which make them look like user input targets.
