{"id": "21706", "title": "Bug 21706 - BidiUtil in win32 has Class.forName() usage", "description": "The BidiUtil class in the win32 version of SWT uses Class.forName() to instantiate a Callback object. However, this causes a NoClassDefFoundError in the CLDC version of SWT since it is not defined in the CLDC class libraries. To address this issue, a private constructor should be added to the BidiUtil class to prevent instantiation. This change will not add any size to the class, as the compiler provides a free public constructor by default.", "OB": "When using the CLDC version of SWT and verifying or using jxeLink or similar tools, a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown at the line `static Callback callback = new Callback (BidiUtil.class, \"windowProc\", 4);` in the BidiUtil class.", "EB": "To resolve this issue, add a private constructor to the BidiUtil class to prevent instantiation. Since there are no non-static methods in this class, making the constructor private is a good practice. This change will not increase the class size, as the compiler already provides a public constructor by default.", "SR": ""}
