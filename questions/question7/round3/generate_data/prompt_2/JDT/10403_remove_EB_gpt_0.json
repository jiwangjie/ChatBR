Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the confirmation message about the deletion and rebuilding of the output directory is not displayed.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, a confirmation message should be displayed, indicating that the output directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project for an existing directory structure. \n2. Verify that no confirmation message is shown about the deletion and rebuilding of the output directory."}
