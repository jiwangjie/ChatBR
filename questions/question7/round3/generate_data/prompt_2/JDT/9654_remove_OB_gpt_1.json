There is duplicated name validation on the first page.\nii. The first and second column should be merged.\n\nOB: No observed behavior mentioned.\n\nEB: The bug report mentions the following expected behaviors:\n\n1. The marking between the button and list is too large. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog.\n2. The table should have a label so that it can contain a mnemonic.\n3. Multiple selection should be allowed, as 'move up' and 'move down' can be applied to more than one item.\n4. The signature preview must be a label that wraps.\n5. It would be nice if the signature preview has the background color set to the same color as a hover.\n\nSR: To reproduce the bug, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Change a parameter name to something very long.\n2. Observe that the preview is cut off."}
