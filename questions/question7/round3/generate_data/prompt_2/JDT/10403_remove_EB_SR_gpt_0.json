{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "EB": "The project creation process should display a confirmation message indicating that the output directory will be deleted and rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Specify an existing directory structure for the project.\n3. Point the output folder at a bin directory that contains additional files.\n4. Proceed with creating the project.\n\nExpected result:\nA confirmation message should appear, stating that the output directory will be deleted and rebuilt.\n\nActual result:\nThe confirmation message is not displayed, and the project is created without scrubbing the bin directory."}
