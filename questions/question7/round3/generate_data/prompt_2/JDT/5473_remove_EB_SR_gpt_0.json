{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 - ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "When using the ShiftLeft function with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text does not shift correctly. Build 200110251.", "OB": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually. \n2. Execute the ShiftLeft function. \n3. The text does not move as expected. \nIt is unclear how the ShiftLeft function is specified, but in this scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). However, it is definitely confusing if there is a stray space as it prevents the text from shifting.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces. \n2. Execute the ShiftLeft function. \n3. Verify that the first line is shifted left at least to the space character and the second line is shifted left correctly regardless of the presence of a stray space."}
