This results in the build menu option appearing in the Java popup menus, which I believe is incorrect.", "OB": "The \"Build\" action is always enabled in the popup menu, even when the \"Perform build automatically on resource modification\" option is selected in Preferences > Workbench.", "EB": "If the \"Perform build automatically on resource modification\" option is selected, the \"Build\" action should not be enabled in the popup menu.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:1. Open Eclipse in the Java perspective.2. Go to Preferences > Workbench.3. Select the \"Perform build automatically on resource modification\" option.4. Create a Java project or open an existing Java project.5. Right-click on a file or folder in the project.6. Observe that the \"Build\" action is still enabled in the popup menu, even though it should not be."}
