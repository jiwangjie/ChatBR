{"id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473 - ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.", "OB": "When there is a tab character in the first line and spaces in the second line, executing the ShiftLeft command results in the text not shifting as expected. It is unclear how the behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). It is also confusing if there is a stray space, as it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character in the first line with spaces, the two lines should be visually indented the same. Then, executing the ShiftLeft command should move the text correctly. In the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab and align with the spaces). This behavior should be clear and consistent, regardless of the presence of stray spaces.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the document and find a line that has a tab character followed by spaces.\n2. Replace the tab character with spaces, so that both lines are visually indented the same.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n\nExpected result: The text should be shifted correctly, with the second line shifted left and the first line shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab and align with the spaces).\n\nObserved result: The text does not shift as expected, causing confusion when there are stray spaces."}
