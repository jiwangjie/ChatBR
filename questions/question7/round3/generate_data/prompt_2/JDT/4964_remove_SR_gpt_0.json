{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist does not select the appropriate option", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "Build 204: While writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose. At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '(' because the line I was typing was supposed to be: button.dispose(); But as soon as I type the '(', then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "When typing in the code editor, if the automatic code assist list is up and I type '(', it should select the option that matches what I have typed so far.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the code editor in Build 204. 2. Type 'button.dispose' and do not look at the code assist list. 3. Notice that the code assist list is up with options: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. 4. Type '('. 5. Verify that the option selected by code assist is not the one that matches what has been typed so far."}
