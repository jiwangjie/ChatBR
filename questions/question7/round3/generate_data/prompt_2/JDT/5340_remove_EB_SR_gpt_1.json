{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340 - Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately. Eventually, the exception list comes up and ignores the cancellation request. It should either honor the cancellation request or disable the cancel button. This can be achieved by passing 'false' for the 'cancellable' parameter when calling 'ProgressMonitorDialog.run'.", "OB": "When adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog closes immediately after cancelling the process.", "EB": "After cancelling the process of adding an exception breakpoint, the progress dialog should not close immediately. The exception list should either not come up or should reflect the cancellation request.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: \n1. Open the application. \n2. Go to the breakpoint section. \n3. Add an exception breakpoint. \n4. Attempt to cancel the process during the progress dialog."}
