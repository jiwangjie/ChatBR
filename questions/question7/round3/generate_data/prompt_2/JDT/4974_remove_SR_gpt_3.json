It seems that setting the output location and classpath as separate operations creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Similar to the validation process, which checks the classpath and output location simultaneously, the setting of classpath and output location should be combined into one single operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to something like: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
