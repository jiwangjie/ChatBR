{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964: Automatic Code Assist not considering context", "description": "When typing SWT code, the automatic code assist feature does not consider the context to suggest the appropriate code. For example, when typing 'button.dispose', the code assist suggests 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'. It also automatically inserts the selected item, even if it is not the desired code. The code assist should take into account the typed parentheses and match the closest matching code. Alternatively, it should be case-sensitive when automatically inserting code.", "OB": "In build 204, while writing SWT code, I type 'button.dispose'. The automatic code assist list is up, but since I'm not looking, I do not realize it. The code assist suggestions are 'DISPOSED', 'intWidget', and 'dispose()'.", "EB": "", "SR": "In build 204, while writing SWT code, type 'button.dispose'. Do not select any item from the code assist list. Observe that the code assist list is shown but not automatically inserted."}
