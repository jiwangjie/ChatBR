{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "When attempting to set the output location and classpath for a project, the following issue occurs: \nPressing Ok results in the error message: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. This problem arises because setting the output location and classpath are being treated as two separate operations, causing an illegal state to be created when the first operation is set.", "OB": "When pressing Ok after attempting to set the output location and classpath for a project, the error message 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src' is displayed.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce this bug, follow the steps below: \n\n1. Create a new project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Open the project properties. \n3. In the project properties, change the source folder to use the project as the source folder and the output location to use the project as the output location."}
