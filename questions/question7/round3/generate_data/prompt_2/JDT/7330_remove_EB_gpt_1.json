{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" in the context menu until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis, which is not clear to users. It is not acceptable to force users to switch views to access certain actions. All actions should be reachable from the editor, either in the context menu or via the Edit menu.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is missing from the context menu.", "EB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" should be available in the context menu when text is selected.", "SR": "1. Open the editor.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n4. Verify that the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not present in the context menu.\n5. Switch to the Outline view.\n6. Repeat steps 2-4 and verify that the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is now present in the context menu."}
