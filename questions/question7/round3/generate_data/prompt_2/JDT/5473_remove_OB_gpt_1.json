It is also important to replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually. Additionally, having a stray space is confusing as it prevents the text from shifting.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open a default text editor. 2. Type in the following on two separate lines, intermixing spaces and tabs: <space><tab>some text<tab>some text2. 3. Highlight the two lines and execute the ShiftLeft command. Notice that nothing moves."}
