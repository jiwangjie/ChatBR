The problem occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations. Setting the output location first creates an illegal state.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a new project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. \n2. Open the project properties. \n3. Change the settings to use the project itself as the source folder and output location."}
