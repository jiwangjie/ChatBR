This behavior is confusing, as it is unclear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character with spaces in the first line, executing ShiftLeft should shift the second line left and the first line left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab). If there is a stray space, it should not prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "1. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same.\n2. Perform the ShiftLeft operation.\n3. Observe that the second line is shifted left and the first line is shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., remove the tab). Ensure that any stray spaces do not prevent the text from shifting."}
