{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403: Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "The current behavior is not defined.", "EB": "When creating a new project, there should be a confirmation step to ensure that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the project creation wizard.\n2. Select an existing directory structure.\n3. Specify a bin directory as the output folder.\n4. Proceed with the project creation.\n5. Confirm that a step prompts the user to confirm the deletion and rebuilding of the output directory."}
