{"id": "5473", "title": "ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "The ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces is not working as expected in Build 200110251. When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that both lines are visually indented the same, executing ShiftLeft does not move the text correctly. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). There should not be any stray spaces as they make it confusing to understand why the text won't shift.", "OB": "In a default text editor, type in the following:\n<space><tab>some text\n<tab>some text2\nNow, highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft. Notice that nothing moves.", "EB": "After replacing the tab character with spaces, executing ShiftLeft should correctly move the text. The first line should be shifted left at least to the first non-space character (i.e., get rid of the tab) and the second line should also be shifted left. There should not be any stray spaces that prevent the text from shifting.", "SR": "1. Open a default text editor.\n2. Type in the following:\n   - Line 1: <space><tab>some text\n   - Line 2: <tab>some text2\n3. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces to visually align both lines.\n4. Highlight the two lines.\n5. Execute the ShiftLeft command.\n6. Verify that both lines are shifted left correctly and there are no stray spaces preventing the text from shifting."}
