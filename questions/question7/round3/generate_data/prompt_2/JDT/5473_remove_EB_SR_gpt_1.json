When ShiftLeft is executed, the text moves. It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). Any stray space is confusing, as it is not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
