{"id": "5340", "title": "Bug 5340: Cancelling add exception breakpoint has no effect", "description": "When attempting to cancel the process of adding an exception breakpoint in the breakpoints pane of the debug perspective, the cancellation request is ignored and the progress dialog closes immediately. The expected behavior is for the cancellation request to either be honored, or for the cancel button to be disabled. To achieve this, when calling ProgressMonitorDialog.run, false should be passed for the 'cancellable' parameter.", "OB": "The progress dialog closes immediately after clicking cancel during the process of adding an exception breakpoint. The cancellation request is ignored.", "EB": "The progress dialog should remain open after clicking cancel during the process of adding an exception breakpoint. The cancellation request should be honored and the progress should stop.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1) Go to the breakpoints pane in the debug perspective. 2) Click the 'J!' button to add an exception breakpoint. 3) In the progress dialog, click cancel."}
