Consider the enclosed class. As a programmer, I must add a parameter to the 'baz' call in 'bar' to make the program correct. Steps:\n1. UI can decide whether it wants to use the code assist end position (until the end of the current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, in order to control the amount of source to replace. Removing code assist option.\n", "OB": "The behavior observed is not mentioned in the bug report.", "EB": "The code should be changed to: baz(x.foo().foo())\nI would rather it gave me: baz(x.foo()x.foo())\npublic class X {\n\tvoid bar(X x) {\n\t\tbaz(x.foo());\n\t}\n\tint foo() {\n\t\treturn 5;\n\t}\n\tvoid baz(int i, int j) {\n\t}\n}", "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Change the 'baz' call to 'baz(x.x.foo())'\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list\n5. Select 'foo()'\n6. Observe the behavior and compare with the expected behavior."}
