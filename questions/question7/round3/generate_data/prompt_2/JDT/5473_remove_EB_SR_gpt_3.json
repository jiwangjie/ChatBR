", "OB": "When the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same, and then ShiftLeft is executed, the text moves. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). However, currently, the behavior is confusing because there is a stray space and it's not clear why the text won't shift.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
