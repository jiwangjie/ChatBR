When adding a parameter to the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method, the code assist should only replace until the cursor location or until the end of the current identifier. However, currently the code is being replaced until the end of the identifier.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open the enclosed code sample.\n2. Modify the 'baz' call in the 'bar' method to include a parameter.\n\nAfter step 2, the code should be changed to:\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\nI would rather it gave me:\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n  void bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo());\n  }\n  int foo() {\n    return 5;\n  }\n  void baz(int i, int j) {}\n}", "OB": "The code is changed to:\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\nI would rather it gave me:\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())", "EB": "The code is changed to:\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\nI would rather it gave me:\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\nThe choice between replacing until the end or until the cursor location should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).", "SR": "1.
