{"id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330 - Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed on a personal taste basis and it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view in order to access certain actions. We should make all actions reachable from the editor.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "All actions should be available in the context menu when text is selected.", "SR": "1. Open the editor and select some text.\n2. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu.\n3. Confirm that the \"Add Javadoc Comment\" action is missing from the menu."}
