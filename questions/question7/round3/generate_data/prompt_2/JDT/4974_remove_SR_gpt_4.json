The issue is caused by setting the output location and classpath as two separate operations, which creates an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be offered as a single operation. Similar to the validation process, where classpath and output location are checked together, the setting of classpath / output location should be combined into one operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
