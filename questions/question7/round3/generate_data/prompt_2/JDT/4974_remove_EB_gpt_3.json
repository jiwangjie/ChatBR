{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "The bug report is about an issue with setting the classpath and output location for a project. The current behavior is causing an error message to appear when pressing 'Ok' after changing these settings. The problem arises because setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, which leads to an illegal state being created. There is no expected behavior mentioned in the bug report. The steps to reproduce the issue are not provided in a clear format. ", "OB": "When pressing 'Ok' after changing the classpath and output location settings in a project, an error message appears: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. Open the project properties.\n3. Modify the project properties to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location.\n4. Press 'Ok'."}
