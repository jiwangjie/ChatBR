The enclosed class is an example. To make the program correct, a parameter must be added to the 'baz' function call in the 'bar' function.\n\nSteps:\n1. The UI can choose to use the code assist end position (until the end of the current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, in order to control the amount of source code to replace. The code assist option has been removed.", "OB": "The code has been changed to:\n\nbaz(x.foo().foo())\n\nI would prefer it to be:\n\nbaz(x.foo()x.foo())\n\npublic class X {\n  void bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo());\n  }\n\n  int foo() {\n    return 5;\n  }\n\n  void baz(int i, int j) {\n  }\n}", "EB": "The code should be changed to:\n\nbaz(x.x.foo())", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Change the 'baz' call to:\n\n   baz(x.x.foo())\n\n2. Place the cursor after the first 'x.'\n\n3. Press Ctrl+Space to bring up code assist.\n\n4. Type 'f' to filter the list.\n\n5. Select 'foo()'.\n\n6. Observe the behavior of the code assist."}
