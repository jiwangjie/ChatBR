{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and not entering anything in the package name field, a confusing message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. It is unclear what this message means. It is also uncertain if this is an error. If it is an error, the message should be displayed in red with the error icon. \n\nNOTES:\n- EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM): There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.\n- MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM): It is a warning. I will remove the message.\n- EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM): Issue: how to create a default package? It cannot be created by the user since it is always there.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and leaving the package name field empty, a message 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' appears at the top of the wizard.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and leaving the package name field empty, no message should appear at the top of the wizard.", "SR": "1. Open the New Java Package wizard.\n2. Leave the package name field empty.\n3. Observe if any message appears at the top of the wizard."}
