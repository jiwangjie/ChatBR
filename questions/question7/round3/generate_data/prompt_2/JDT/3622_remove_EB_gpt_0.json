It is unclear what exactly this message means and whether it is an error. The finish button should be disabled when the package name field is empty. It is also noted that a default package cannot be created by the user as it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, the following message appears at the top: 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists', even when the package name field is empty.", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1.
