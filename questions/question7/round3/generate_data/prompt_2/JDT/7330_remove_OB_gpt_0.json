I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, the actions are distributed based on personal taste, and this should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. All actions should be reachable from the editor, and it is not acceptable to force users to switch views.", "OB": "The action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is not available on text selection.", "EB": "I expected the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" to be available on text selection.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the editor.\n2. Select a portion of text.\n3. Check if the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" is available via the Edit menu."}
