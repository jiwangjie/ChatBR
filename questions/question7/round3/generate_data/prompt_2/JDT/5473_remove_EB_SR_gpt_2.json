It is unclear how this behavior is specified, but in the first scenario, it appears that the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., the tab should be removed). In any case, if there is a stray space, it is confusing as the reason why the text won't shift is not clear.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
