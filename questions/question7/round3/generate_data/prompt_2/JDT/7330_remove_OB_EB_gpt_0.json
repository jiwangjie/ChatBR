Currently, the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available until switching to the Outline view, rather than being easily accessible in the Edit (or some other global) menu. It appears that the actions are distributed based on personal taste, which should be changed. Users find it unclear why some actions are in the context menu and some are not, even though they should all be reachable from the editor. Forcing users to switch views to access certain actions is not acceptable.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available on text selection in the editor. Users can only find it in the Outline view.", "EB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' should be directly accessible in the Edit (or some other global) menu, without the need to switch to the Outline view.", "SR": "1. Open the editor and select some text.\n2. Check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the Edit menu. If not, proceed to step 3.\n3. Switch to the Outline view and check if the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is available in the menu.\n4. Switch back to the editor and verify that the action is again not available in the menu on text selection."}
