I would like clarification on what this message means and whether it is an error. If it is an error, it should be displayed in red with an error icon.\n\nNOTES: EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM) - There should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled.\n\nMA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM) - It is a warning. I will remove the message.\n\nEG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM) - How can a default package be created? It can't be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before typing anything, a message appears at the top saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before typing anything, a message appears at the top saying 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'.
