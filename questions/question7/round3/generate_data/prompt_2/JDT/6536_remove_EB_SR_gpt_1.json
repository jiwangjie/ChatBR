The expected behavior is that the action should add the Javadoc to the field. However, currently nothing happens when selecting this option. It is suggested that either this menu should be removed or, preferably, the action should be implemented to add the Javadoc to the field.", "OB": "When selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option from the context menu on a field in TH, nothing happens.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that selecting the 'Add Javadoc' option should add the Javadoc to the field in TH.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: \n1.
