{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with 'button.DISPOSED' which isn't even close to what I want. I had to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "While writing SWT code, when I typed 'button.dispose', the code assist list appeared. The first suggestion in the list, 'DISPOSED', was automatically selected. As a result, the code 'button.DISPOSED' was inserted instead of the expected 'button.dispose()'.", "EB": "While writing SWT code, when I type 'button.dispose', the code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and suggest 'dispose()' as the top recommendation, instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "Build 204\n1. Launch the SWT code editor. \n2. Start typing 'button.dispose'\n3. Observe that the code assist list appears and 'DISPOSED' is selected automatically. Instead, it should suggest 'dispose()' as the top recommendation or show a case-sensitive suggestion."}
