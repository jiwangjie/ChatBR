{"id": "4974", "title": "Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "Currently, the process of setting the classpath and output location is done in two separate steps. It would be more convenient if these two operations could be performed together as one operation. Additionally, the error message displayed when attempting to set a nested classpath or output location is unclear and should be improved.", "OB": "N/A", "EB": "The classpath and output location should be able to be set simultaneously. When attempting to set a nested classpath or output location, the error message should clearly state that it is not allowed, for example: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to the settings or preferences menu.\n3. Look for the options related to setting the classpath and output location.\n4. Try to set both the classpath and output location at the same time.\n5. Verify that the classpath and output location are successfully set together.\n6. Attempt to set a nested classpath or output location.\n7. Verify that the application displays an appropriate error message indicating that nesting is not allowed."}
