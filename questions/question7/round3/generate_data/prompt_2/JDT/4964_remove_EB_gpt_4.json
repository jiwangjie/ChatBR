{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist not suggesting the correct completion", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED which isn't even close to what I want. I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. \nEither that, or it needs to be case-sensitive when it is automatically inserting code.", "OB": "Build 204\nWhile writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose\nAt this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget. I then type '('. But as soon as I type the '(' then automatic code assist seems to insert whatever is selected.", "EB": "Build 204\nWhile writing SWT code, I type the following: button.dispose\nAt this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking.", "SR": "1. Open the SWT code editor in Build 204.\n2. Start typing the code 'button.dispose'.\n3. Do not pay attention to the code assist list that appears.\n4. Type '(' immediately after 'dispose'.\n5. Observe that automatic code assist inserts the selected item from the code assist list."}
