", "OB": "When executing the ShiftLeft operation on text with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text does not move as expected.", "EB": "When executing the ShiftLeft operation on text with intermixed tabs and spaces, the text should move correctly. Specifically, the second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). If there is a stray space, it should not affect the shifting behavior.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open a document with text containing mixed tabs and spaces for indentation.\n2. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are visually indented the same.\n3. Execute the ShiftLeft operation.\n\nExpected result: The text should shift left correctly.\n\nActual result: The text does not shift as expected."}
