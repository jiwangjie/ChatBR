Open the enclosed class.\n2. Go to the 'bar' method.\n3. Notice that the 'baz' call is missing a parameter.\n\nObserved behavior:\n- The code in 'bar' is: baz(x.foo());\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The code should be changed to: baz(x.foo().foo());\n\nEB: I would rather it gave me: baz(x.foo()x.foo());\n\npublic class X {\n  void bar(X x) {\n    baz(x.foo());\n  }\n\n  int foo() {\n    return 5;\n  }\n\n  void baz(int i, int j) {\n  }\n}\n\nKUM (5/21/01 9:02:11 AM)\nThe text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure.\nMoved to ITPJCORE.\n\nPM (9/4/2001 2:58:56 PM)\nOption was added.\n\nPM (9/25/2001 2:20:50 PM)\nRemoving option. The choice amongst one or the other should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).\nMoving to ITPJUI.", "OB": "The code in 'bar' is: baz(x.foo());", "EB": "The code should be changed to: baz(x.foo().foo());\nEB: I would rather it gave me: baz(x.foo()x.foo());", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1.
