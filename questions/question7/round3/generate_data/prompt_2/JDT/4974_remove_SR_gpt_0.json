This error occurs because setting the output location and classpath are treated as separate operations, causing an illegal state.", "EB": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation. Similar to the validation process for checking classpath and output location together, the setting of classpath and output location should be offered as a single operation. Additionally, the error message should be improved to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": ""}
