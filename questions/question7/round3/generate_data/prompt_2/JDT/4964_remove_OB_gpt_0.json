{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter", "description": "Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I ended up with: button.DISPOSED, which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start again, paying more attention this time. Code assist should notice that I have typed a '(' and that this matches 'dispose()' far better than 'DISPOSED'. Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive when it is automatically inserting stuff.", "OB": "When writing SWT code and typing 'button.dispose'", "EB": "The code assist should suggest 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED'", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Build 204\n2. While writing SWT code, type 'button.dispose' without looking at the code assist list."}
