At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am not looking. There are 2 items in the list now: DISPOSED, intWidgetdispose(), voidWidget.

It should then insert the 'dispose()' method from the code assist list instead of 'DISPOSED'.", "SR": "1. Open the code editor.\n2. Type 'button.dispose'.\n3.
