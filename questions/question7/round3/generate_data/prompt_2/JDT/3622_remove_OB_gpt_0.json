{"id": "3622", "title": "Bug 3622 - New Package Wizard has confusing message", "description": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a confusing message appears at the top before any input is entered in the package name field. The message states 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists'. It is unclear what this message means and whether it is an error. It is suggested that if it is an error, it should be displayed in red with the error icon. Additionally, it is noted that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. Furthermore, there is a concern about how to create a default package as it cannot be created by the user since it always exists.", "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a message stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' is displayed before entering any input in the package name field.", "EB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, the confusing message stating 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists' should be removed.
