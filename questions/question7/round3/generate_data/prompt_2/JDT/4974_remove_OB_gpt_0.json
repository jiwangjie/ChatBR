{"id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974: Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "The bug report is missing a description of the issue. Based on the context, it seems that there is an issue with the operation to set the classpath and output location, and also with an error message. The error message should be updated to provide a clearer explanation. The bug report also provides steps to reproduce the issue.", "OB": "The bug report does not provide information about the observed behavior.", "EB": "The operation to set classpath and output location should be combined as one step, similar to the validation process. The error message should be updated to say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location. 2. In the project properties, change the settings to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location."}
