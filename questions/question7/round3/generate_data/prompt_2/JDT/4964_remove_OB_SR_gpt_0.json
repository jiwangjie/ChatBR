{"id": "4964", "title": "Bug 4964 - Automatic Code Assist not suggesting correct method", "description": "When using automatic code assist feature, I noticed that it does not suggest the correct method based on the context. For example, when I typed 'button.DISPOSED', it should have suggested 'dispose()' instead of 'DISPOSED' as the method to insert. However, I had to manually delete the incorrect suggestion and type 'dispose()' myself. It would be helpful if the code assist tool was smarter in recognizing that I had typed a '(' and that 'dispose()' is a better match than 'DISPOSED'. Alternatively, it should be case sensitive when automatically inserting suggestions.", "OB": "Automatic code assist tool suggests incorrect method 'DISPOSED' instead of 'dispose()'", "EB": "Automatic code assist tool should suggest the method 'dispose()' when typing 'button.DISPOSED'", "SR": "1. Open the code editor\n2. Start typing 'button.DISPOSED'\n3. Observe the suggestion provided by the automatic code assist tool\n4. Expected: The suggestion should be 'dispose()'\n5. Actual: The suggestion is 'DISPOSED'\n6. Manually delete the incorrect suggestion\n7. Type 'dispose()' manually"}
