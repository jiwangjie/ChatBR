{"id": "10403", "title": "Bug 10403 - Project creation should confirm the bin directory can be scrubbed", "description": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we should confirm that the output directory (usually named 'bin') can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a bin directory which contains more than just .class files and can be rebuilt from the available .java files.", "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, no confirmation or warning is displayed about whether the bin directory can be deleted and rebuilt.", "EB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder at a bin directory, a confirmation or warning message should be displayed asking if the user wants to delete the existing bin directory and rebuild it.", "SR": "1. Open the project creation dialog.\n2. Choose an existing directory structure.\n3. Set the output folder to a bin directory.\n4. Proceed with project creation.\n5. Verify that a confirmation or warning message is displayed asking if the user wants to delete the existing bin directory and rebuild it."}
