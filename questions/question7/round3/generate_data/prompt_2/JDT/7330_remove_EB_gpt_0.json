I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, it is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. This should be changed. All actions must be reachable from the editor, either in the context menu or via the Edit menu. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.", "OB": "The action 'Add Javadoc Comment' is not available in the context menu.", "EB": "", "SR": "1. Open the editor and select a block of text.\n2. Right-click on the selected text to open the context menu and check if the 'Add Javadoc Comment' action is available.\n3. If the action is not available, go to the Edit menu and check if the action is available there."}
