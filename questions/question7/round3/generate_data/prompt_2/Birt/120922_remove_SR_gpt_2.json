Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. And then the user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. Do you want to save the changes? [Yes] [No] [Cancel]. \n\nYes would save the changes. \nNo would discard the changes. \nCancel would do nothing and remain on the Source page. \nIn addition, the dialog is titled 'Error'.\n\nObserved Behavior (OB): If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. This problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder) and the error message is not very clear. The error message is 'Source page is dirty'.\n\nExpected Behavior (EB): A better and more typical approach would be that when the XML Report Design has been changed, the dialog should use a better title (and should not have quotes).\n\nSteps to Reproduce (SR): 1. Open XML Report Designer. 2. Edit some XML content in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor. 3. Attempt to switch back to the Layout view. 4. Observe the error message."}
