{"id": "115960", "title": "Bug 115960 - Datetime values retrieved from table show different format in dynamic text item and data/text item", "description": "", "OB": "When datetime values are retrieved from a table, they are displayed in different formats in a dynamic text item and a data/text item.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that datetime values should be displayed in the same format in both the dynamic text item and the data/text item. However, currently, the dynamic text item displays the datetime value in a different format compared to the data/text item.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: 1. Input new Date() as the content for three items. 2. Save and preview the items. The expected result is that they should all show the same format. However, the actual result is that the data and text item show the same format, while the dynamic text item shows a different format."}
