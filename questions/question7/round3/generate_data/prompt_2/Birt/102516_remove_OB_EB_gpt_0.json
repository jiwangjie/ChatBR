The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'. Bug <a href=\"https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372\">10137</a>2 asks for the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load. Eventually, a message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.", "EB": "When the data set editor is opened, only a subset of the schema should be initially loaded, instead of querying the entire schema. This will improve the loading time and prevent the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' from being displayed.", "SR": "1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor.\n2. Observe that the entire schema is queried and it takes a long time to load.\n3. Observe that the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' is displayed.\n4. After the bug fix, open the JDBC Data Set Editor again.\n5. Observe that only a subset of the schema is initially loaded, improving the loading time."}
