{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - getcolumnlabel from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "The current implementation of getcolumnlabel in the meta data object does not return user recognizable strings. This is problematic because the labels need to be displayed to the end user before extraction. Hence, the getcolumnlabel method should return the same labels as after extraction.", "OB": "When using the getcolumnlabel method in the meta data object, it does not return user recognizable strings.", "EB": "The getcolumnlabel method in the meta data object should return user recognizable strings.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a meta data object.\n2. Call the getcolumnlabel method on the meta data object.\n3. Verify that the returned label is not a user recognizable string."}
