Set a filter in the data set with the expression 'row[0] equals to '\n2. Click on the Preview tab.\n\nActual result:\nThe first result record is returned incorrectly when previewing.\n\nExpected result:\nAs the developer said, row[0] can only be generated after all the data has been fetched. Therefore, row[0] should not be used as a filter expression."}
