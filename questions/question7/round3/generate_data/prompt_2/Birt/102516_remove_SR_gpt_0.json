{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "Bug 102516: JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand.\nThe JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.\n\nOB: On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, however, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.\n\nEB: Could the loading of the tree be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter?\n\nSR: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform.\n2. Verify that the tree control shows every schema on the system, resulting in a warning message upon loading.\n3. Expand the tree or apply a filter to load only the necessary tables and columns."}
