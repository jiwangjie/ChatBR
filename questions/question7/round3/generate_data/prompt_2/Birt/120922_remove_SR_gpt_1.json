Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. The options given are: Yes (which saves the changes), No (which discards the changes), and Cancel (which does nothing and remains on the Source page). In addition, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "If you edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, and then try to switch back to the Layout view, you will get an error message indicating that you need to save your changes. The problem is that the user has to figure out what they need to do to save the changes (or discard them, which is even harder), and the error message is not very clear. The error message is 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be: 'The XML Report Design has been changed. Please choose one of the following options:' and then list the options. The dialog should use a better title (and certainly should not have the quotes).", "SR": ""}
