{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can easily be several hundred tables. Even with the schema filter implemented in the code from CVS on 6/30/05, there is still a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, resulting in a long wait time. Eventually, a warning message appears that says 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor on the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers. \n2. Wait for the entire schema to be queried. \n3. Look for the warning message that says 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' \n\nPlease note that Bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> asks for the ability to filter based on schema."}
