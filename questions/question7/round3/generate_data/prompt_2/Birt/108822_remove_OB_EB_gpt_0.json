{"id": "108822", "title": "More efficient logic for processing disk sorting with border values for row values", "description": "Currently, the program encounters issues when sorting data on disk, specifically when there is a border value for the row count. The expected behavior is for the program to handle this scenario more effectively.", "OB": "The program encounters issues when sorting data on disk with a row count of 40000 and when the program is set to process data that is less than 40000 rows. The issues include: 1. Saving the file as a temporary file. 2. Calling the file to memory. 3. Sorting the data. 4. Saving the file to a temporary file.", "EB": "The program should handle the disk sorting process more efficiently when there is a border value for the row count. It should successfully save the file as a temporary file, call the file to memory, sort the data, and save the file again without any issues.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Sort data on disk with a row count of 40000.\n2. Set the program to process data that is less than 40000 rows.\n3. Observe the issues described in the observed behavior section."}
