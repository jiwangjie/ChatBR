The expected behavior is as follows: \n\n1. For Plain, I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed. \n2. For Auto, I expect the content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags. \n3. For HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 to appear literally with RTF tags. Please see the attached report for reference.", "OB": "The dynamic text element's Content Type property does not have any effect on how the report is displayed.
