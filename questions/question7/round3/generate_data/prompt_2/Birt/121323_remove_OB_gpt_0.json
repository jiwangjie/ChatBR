{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not persisting the filter information when leaving the dialog. Additionally, there is confusion regarding the use of plain XPath expressions and filtering.", "OB": "When leaving the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information entered is not persisted. If an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] is entered in the column mapping, the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information when leaving the dialog. The entered XPath expressions with selection parts should be stored correctly in the filterInfo HashMap.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left'], in the column mapping.\n3. Enter some filter information.\n4. Close the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n\nExpected result: The entered filter information should be persisted.\n\nActual result: The filter information is lost."}
