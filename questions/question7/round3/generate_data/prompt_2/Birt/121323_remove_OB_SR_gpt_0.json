{"id": "121323", "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information when the application is closed and reopened. This means that any filters that were previously set are lost and need to be reconfigured each time the application is restarted.", "EB": "Ideally, the XML Edit Data Set dialog should save and remember any filter settings that are applied. This would allow users to easily resume their work without having to manually reapply filters each time the application is reopened.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Launch the application\n2. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog\n3. Apply a filter to the data set\n4. Close the application\n5. Reopen the application\n6. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog\n\nExpected behavior: The previously set filter should still be applied to the data set.\n\nObserved behavior: The filter is not persisted and needs to be reapplied manually."}
