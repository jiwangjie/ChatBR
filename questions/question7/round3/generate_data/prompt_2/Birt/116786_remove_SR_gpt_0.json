For example, <property name=\"fileName\">E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path instead. For example, if my report design is located in $project/test, the relative path should be saved as lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": ""}
