{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "When using a dynamic text element to display the contents of a database field with three types of content (HTML text within <html ...</html> tag, HTML fragments not within <html> tag, and text with RTF tags), the report displays the same results regardless of the dynamic text element's Content Type property (Auto, Plain, or HTML). The expected results are as follows:\n\n1) For the Plain content type, the literal content (including all tags) should be displayed.\n\n2) For the Auto content type, content 1, 2, and 3 should appear properly without HTML or RTF tags.\n\n3) For the HTML content type, content 1 and 2 should appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 should appear literally with RTF tags.", "OB": "", "EB": "The report displays the same results whether I set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML.\n\nExpected results:\n\n1) For the Plain content type, I expect the literal content (including all tags) to be displayed.\n\n2) For the Auto content type, I expect content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags.\n\n3) For the HTML content type, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 to appear literally with RTF tags.\n\nSee attached report.", "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n\n1) Have a database field with three types of content:\n   - HTML text within <html ...</html> tag\n   - HTML fragments not within <html> tag\n   - Text with RTF tags\n\n2) Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field."}
