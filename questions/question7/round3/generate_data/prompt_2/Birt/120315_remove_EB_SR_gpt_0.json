{"id": "120315", "title": "PDF emitter does not apply 'display: none' property to items", "description": "When the display property of an item is set to 'none' in the new PDF emitter, it does not take effect as expected.", "OB": "Currently, when the display property of an item is set to 'none' in the new PDF emitter, it doesn't have any impact on the visibility of the item in the generated PDF. The item appears visible in the output PDF even though it should be hidden.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the display property of an item is set to 'none' in the new PDF emitter, the item should be hidden in the generated PDF.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a document with an item.\n2. Set the display property of the item to 'none'.\n3. Generate a PDF using the new PDF emitter.\n4. Open the generated PDF and verify if the item is still visible despite having the display property set to 'none'."}
