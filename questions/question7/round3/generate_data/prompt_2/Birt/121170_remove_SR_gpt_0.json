{"id": "121170", "title": "Bug 121170 - get column label from meta data object should return user recognizable strings", "description": "When retrieving column labels from the meta data object, the labels returned before extraction are null, while the labels returned after extraction are recognizable strings. However, since the labels need to be displayed to the end user before doing the extraction, the 'getcolumnlabel' method before extraction should also return the same labels as after extraction.", "OB": "The labels returned by the 'getcolumnlabel' method before extraction are null.", "EB": "The 'getcolumnlabel' method should return the same recognizable strings before extraction as it does after extraction.", "SR": "1. Make sure the 'getcolumnlabel' method is called before and after the extraction process.\n2. Verify that the labels returned before extraction are null, while the labels returned after extraction are recognizable strings.\n3. Ensure that the 'getcolumnlabel' method returns the same recognizable strings before extraction as it does after extraction."}
