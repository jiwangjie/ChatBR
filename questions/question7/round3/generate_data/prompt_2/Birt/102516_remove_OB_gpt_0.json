{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, causing delays and potentially exceeding the limit of 500 items in the available list. This bug aims to improve the loading performance and limit the number of items displayed.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the user has to wait while the entire schema is queried, and eventually receives an error message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The loading of the tree should be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter. This would improve the performance and prevent exceeding the limit of items in the available list.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the data set editor. 2. Observe the loading process and the error message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.  Bug 101372 asks for the ability to filter based on schema."}
