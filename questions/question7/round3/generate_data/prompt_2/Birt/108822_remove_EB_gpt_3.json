{"id": "108822", "title": "More robust logic needed for processing disk sorting with boundary values for row values", "description": "When performing disk sorting, if sorting on 40000 rows of data and the program is set to process data less than 40000 rows, the current implementation follows the following steps:\n1. Save the file as a temporary file\n2. Load the file into memory\n3. Sort the data\n4. Save the sorted data to the temporary file.\n\nHowever, this implementation is causing unexpected behavior.", "OB": "When performing disk sorting on 40000 rows of data and processing fewer than 40000 rows, the current implementation saves the file as a temporary file, but it does not properly load and sort the data before saving it back to the temporary file.", "EB": "When performing disk sorting on 40000 rows of data and processing fewer than 40000 rows, the program should correctly save the file as a temporary file, load the data from the file into memory, sort the data, and then save the sorted data back to the temporary file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set up a scenario where disk sorting is performed on 40000 rows of data\n2. Configure the program to process fewer than 40000 rows of data\n3. Initiate the sorting process\n4. Verify that the program saves the file as a temporary file, loads the data from the file into memory, properly sorts the data, and saves the sorted data back to the temporary file."}
