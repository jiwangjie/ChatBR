Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved (including the quotes). The user then needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. A dialog with the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' is displayed. Selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, selecting 'No' would discard the changes, and selecting 'Cancel' would do nothing and keep the user on the Source page. Additionally, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor, an error message is displayed when trying to switch back to the Layout view, indicating that the changes need to be saved. The problem is that the user needs to figure out how to save the changes (or discard them) and the error message is not clear. The error message is 'Source page is dirty'.", "EB": "A better and more user-friendly approach would be to indicate that the XML Report Design has been changed. The dialog should use a better title (without the quotes).", "SR": ""}
