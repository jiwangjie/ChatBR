{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922 - 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs to be improved", "description": "In the XML Report Designer editor, when trying to switch back to the Layout view from the 'source' view in the Layout Editor, an error message is displayed stating 'Source page is dirty. Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved.' (including the quotes).\n\nThe user is then left to figure out how to save or discard their changes, with the options presented as:\n   - Yes: saves the changes\n   - No: discards the changes\n   - Cancel: does nothing and remains on the Source page\n\nAdditionally, the dialog is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).\n\nOB: \n\nEB: A better and more typical approach would be for the dialog to use a better title (without the quotes) and for clearer instructions to be provided to the user regarding saving or discarding their changes.\n\nSR: \n1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Switch to the 'source' view in the Layout Editor.\n3. Make changes to the XML.\n4. Try to switch back to the Layout view.\n5. Observe the error message 'Source page is dirty.'."}
