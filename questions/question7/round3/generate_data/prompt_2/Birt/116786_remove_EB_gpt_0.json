{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786: Library include should store relative path.", "description": "When including a library in a report design, the BIRT designer currently stores the absolute path. However, it should be storing the relative path instead.", "OB": "Currently, I observe that the report design stores the absolute path of the library as shown in the example: <property name=\"fileName\"/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property><property name=\"namespace\">lib1</property>", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path for library inclusion. For example, if my report design is located in $project/test, and I include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the relative path should be saved instead.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a report design located in $project/test.\n3. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n4. Save the report design.\n5. Observe that the relative path of the library is stored instead of the absolute path."}
