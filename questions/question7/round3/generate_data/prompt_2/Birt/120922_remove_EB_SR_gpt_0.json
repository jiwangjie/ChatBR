{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922 - 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs improvement", "description": "When editing XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and switching back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed stating that the changes need to be saved. This puts the user in a situation where they need to determine how to save or discard their changes. The dialog is titled 'Error'. It would be better if the behavior and error message were improved to provide clearer instructions on how to save or discard changes. The current error message is 'Source page is dirty' (including the quotes).", "OB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and switching back to the Layout view, an error message is displayed indicating that the changes need to be saved.", "EB": "When editing the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor and switching back to the Layout view, a prompt should be displayed asking the user if they want to save the changes. The prompt should have three options: 'Yes' to save the changes, 'No' to discard the changes, and 'Cancel' to do nothing and remain on the Source page. The dialog should be titled 'Confirm Changes' or similar, rather than 'Error'.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Report Designer editor.\n2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view of the Layout Editor.\n3.
