{"id": "116744", "title": "Bug 116744: Dynamic text content type has no effect", "description": "The dynamic text element's Content Type property has no effect on the displayed results.", "OB": "Currently, the report displays the same results regardless of whether I set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML.", "EB": "I expect the following results based on the Content Type property settings:\n\n- For Plain, I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed.\n- For Auto, I expect content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags.\n- For HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 to appear literally with RTF tags.\n\nHowever, the attached report does not exhibit these expected behaviors.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Prepare a database field with three types of content:\n   a) HTML text within <html ...</html> tags.\n   b) HTML fragments not within <html> tags.\n   c) Text with RTF tags.\n\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field.\n\n3. Set the Content Type property of the dynamic text element to different settings (Auto, Plain, HTML) and observe the displayed results in the report."}
