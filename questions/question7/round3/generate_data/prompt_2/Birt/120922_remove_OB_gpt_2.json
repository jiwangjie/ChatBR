{"id": "120922", "title": "Bug 120922: Improve 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor", "description": "Bug 120922: 'Dirty Page' behavior in XML Report Designer editor needs to be improved. Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved. The user needs to figure out how to save or discard their changes. Currently, a dialog box with the options 'Yes', 'No', and 'Cancel' is displayed when the user tries to switch back to the Layout view. Selecting 'Yes' would save the changes, 'No' would discard the changes, and 'Cancel' would do nothing and remain on the Source page. Furthermore, the dialog box is titled 'Error' (including the quotes).", "OB": "When switching back to the Layout view from the 'source' view of the Layout Editor after making changes to the XML, an error message is displayed stating that the source page is dirty and needs to be saved.", "EB": "A better and more typical approach would be to display a dialog box with a more descriptive title, without the quotes. The dialog box should clearly indicate that the XML Report Design has been changed and prompt the user to save their changes.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Open the XML Report Designer editor. 2. Edit the XML in the 'source' view. 3. Try to switch back to the Layout view. 4. Observe the error message stating that the source page is dirty and needs to be saved."}
