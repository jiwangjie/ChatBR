{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']', the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign file but the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to a lot of trouble.", "OB": "The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog is not persisted when leaving the dialog. The data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The filter information entered in the XML Edit Data Set dialog should be persisted when leaving the dialog. The data should be stored in the filterInfo HashMap.", "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog and check if the filter information is still present."}
