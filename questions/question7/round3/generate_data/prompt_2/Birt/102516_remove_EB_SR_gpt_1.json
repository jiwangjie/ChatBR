{"id": "102516", "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in the data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (also known as catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. This results in a warning message upon loading the page because the tree is being populated on load. The code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes the schema filter, but it does not prevent the warning message from appearing.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the tree control shows every schema (catalog) on the system. This results in a warning message upon loading the page because the tree is being populated on load.", "EB": "The tree control should only load schemas, tables, and columns on demand, rather than preloading all of them on page load. This will prevent the warning message from appearing and improve the performance of the editor.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers. 2. Observe the warning message that appears upon loading the page. 3. Navigate through the tree control and verify that all schemas, tables, and columns are already loaded on page load."}
