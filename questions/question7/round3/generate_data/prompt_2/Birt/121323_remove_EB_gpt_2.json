{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part such as section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way may lead to significant issues.", "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information.

However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information correctly. When entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part such as section[@id='left'], the selection should be stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. When leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation should be persisted to .rptdesign, and the data stored in the filterInfo should be retained.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue: 1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog. 2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, with a selection part such as section[@id='left']. 3. Observe that the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. 4. Close the dialog. 5. Open the dialog again and observe that the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost."}
