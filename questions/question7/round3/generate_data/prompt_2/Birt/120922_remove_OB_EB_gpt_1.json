Other pages cannot be used until the source is saved.\" The user is then asked, \"Do you want to save the changes?\" with options to choose from: <Yes>, <No>, and <Cancel>. Choosing <Yes> would save the changes, choosing <No> would discard the changes, and choosing <Cancel> would do nothing and remain on the Source page. However, the user needs to figure out how to save or discard the changes, and the error message is not very clear.", "OB": "When attempting to switch from the \"source\" view to the Layout view in the XML Report Designer editor without saving the changes, the user is presented with an error dialog titled \"Error\".
