{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include does not store relative path", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path. Currently, it does not store the relative path correctly. For example, if the report design is located in $project/test and we include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, the BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path as $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary, but it is not doing so.", "OB": "The BIRT designer does not generate and save the relative path correctly when including a library in a report design. Instead, it stores the absolute path.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save the relative path correctly when including a library in a report design. It should use the relative path of the library with respect to the location of the report design.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Create a report design located in $project/test.\n2. Include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary.\n3. Save the report design.\n4. Close and reopen the report design.\n5. Verify that the relative path of the library is not generated and saved correctly by checking the library path in the library section of the report design properties."}
