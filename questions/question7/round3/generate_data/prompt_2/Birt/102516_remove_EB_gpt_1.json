{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The current implementation of the JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query loads all tables and columns in the data source upfront, resulting in performance issues. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this is especially problematic as it lists every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. The schema filter functionality is present in the code from CVS dated 6/30/05, but it does not fully prevent the warning message on load. There is a related bug <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372'>101372</a> that requests the ability to filter based on schema.", "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried and the user has to wait for the loading process to complete. This can be time-consuming and results in a warning message stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'", "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should only load tables and columns when requested by the user, improving performance and preventing the warning message from being displayed on load.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe the loading process and the subsequent display of the warning message.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe tables and columns should be loaded on-demand, reducing the loading time and eliminating the warning message."}
