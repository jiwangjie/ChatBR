{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not store the filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] is entered for the column mapping. The selection part is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can potentially cause a lot of trouble.", "OB": "When an XPath expression like section[@id='left'] is entered for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection part is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when exiting the dialog, the filter information is not persisted to the .rptdesign file.", "EB": "After entering an XPath expression for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the filter information should be retained and properly stored in the .rptdesign file when the dialog is closed.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression like section[@id='left'] for the column mapping.\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Open the .rptdesign file and check if the filter information for the XPath expression is retained."}
