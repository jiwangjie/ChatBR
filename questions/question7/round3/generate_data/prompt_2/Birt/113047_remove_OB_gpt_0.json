Create a new data set without a SQL statement. 2. Open the data set editor and navigate to the data source page. 3. Change the data source to a new one. 4. Check if the new data source's children (e.g., databases, tables, columns) are listed. Actual result: No children node listing is observed when changing the data source for a data set in the data set editor page of the query tab. To test if the issue is resolved, close the data set editor and reopen it."}
