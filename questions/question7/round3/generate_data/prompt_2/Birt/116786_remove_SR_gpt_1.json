{"id": "116786", "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer currently stores the absolute path. We need to modify it to store the relative path.\n\nCurrently, the library inclusion is stored as:\n<property name=\"fileName\">/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property>\n<property name=\"namespace\">lib1</property>\n\nThe expected behavior is for the library inclusion to be stored as:\n<property name=\"fileName\">$project/test/lib1.rptlibrary</property>\n\nExample: Suppose my report design is saved in the path $project/test. When I include a library in the report design, the BIRT designer should generate and store the relative path.\n", "OB": "Currently, I observe that the report design stores the absolute path for the library inclusion.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and store the relative path when a library is included in a report design.\nExample: If my report design is saved in the path $project/test, the library inclusion should be stored as $project/test/lib1.rptlibrary.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a report design and save it in a specific path.\n2. Include a library in the report design.\n3. Observe that the library inclusion is stored with an absolute path instead of a relative path."}
