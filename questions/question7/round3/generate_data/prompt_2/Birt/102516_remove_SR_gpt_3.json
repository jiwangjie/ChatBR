The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query currently displays a tree control that lists all the tables and columns in the data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Currently, even with the schema filter, the tree is being populated on page load, causing a warning message to appear. The user wants the load of the tree to be deferred until the user expands the tree or applies a filter.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor page displays a tree control that lists every schema (catalog) on the system, which includes several hundred tables.
