Create a dataset with 40000 rows of data.\n2. Set the program to process only a subset of the data, e.g., less than 40000 rows.\n3. Sort the data on disk.\n4. Observe the file-saving process:\n   a. Save the file as a temporary file.\n   b. Load the file into memory.\n   c. Sort the data.\n   d. Save the sorted data to the temporary file.\n   e. (Missing information - please provide)"}
