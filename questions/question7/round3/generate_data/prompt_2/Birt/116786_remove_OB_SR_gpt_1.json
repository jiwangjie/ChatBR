{"id": "116786", "title": "Library include does not store relative path", "description": "When a library is included in a report design, the BIRT designer does not generate nor save a relative path for the library. This causes issues when the project is moved or the library is accessed from a different location.", "OB": "The BIRT designer does not generate or save a relative path for libraries included in a report design.", "EB": "The BIRT designer should generate and save a relative path for libraries included in a report design, ensuring that the path remains valid even when the project is moved or the library is accessed from a different location.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Create a new report design in the BIRT designer.\n2. Include a library in the report design.\n3. Save the report design.\n4. Move the project folder to a different location or access the library from a different location.\n5. Open the report design again and check the path of the included library. It should be a relative path starting from the project folder."}
