Instead of performing the sorting operation in chunks, it would be better to sort the data directly in memory and then write it back to the file.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set up a dataset with at least 40000 rows of data.\n2. Configure the program to process less than 40000 rows.\n3. Initiate the sorting process on the dataset.\n4. Observe the sorting operation and the resulting sorted file."}
