{"id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not save the filter information when entering an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left']. The selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign but the data stored in the filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this way can lead to trouble.", "OB": "When entering an XPath expression with a selection part like section[@id='left'] for the column mapping in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.", "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap when leaving the dialog, instead of losing it. This will prevent any data loss during the editing process.", "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'].\n3. Close the dialog.\n4. Reopen the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n5. Check if the XPath expression and the corresponding selection part are still present in the filterInfo HashMap."}
