{"id": "102516", "title": "Bug 102516 - JDBC Data Set Editor does not load tables and columns on demand", "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. Currently, on the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system, which can be several hundred tables. Although the code in CVS from 6/30/05 includes a schema filter, it still results in a warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.", "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, the JDBC Data Set Editor's tree control displays every schema (catalog) on the system, resulting in several hundred tables being shown.
