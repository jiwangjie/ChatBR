{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). Testing with trunk at revision 957942, thus this supposedly affects 7.0.0 as well. In TC6 there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() methods [1]. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\nTo reproduce:\n1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "The bug report does not provide observed behavior details.", "EB": "I would expect that in StandardService.initInternal() the connector.init() call fails because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught there and, if EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in Catalina.load() and finally rethrown as an Error, which should abort Tomcat startup.", "SR": "Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties:\norg.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
