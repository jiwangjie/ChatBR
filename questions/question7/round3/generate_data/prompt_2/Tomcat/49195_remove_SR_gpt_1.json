{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service works, but prints error message", "description": "Specify <Server port=\"1\" in the server.xml file. This can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. Currently, System.exit(0) is used, but it would work regardless of all that. It is also worth testing if jsvc behaves in the same way.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service, Tomcat stops and prints the following error message in the catalina.20100427.log file:27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServerSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down. Despite this error message, Tomcat actually shuts down. After printing the message, the Catalina stopServer() method executes System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat being shut down. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, the Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "If that is the case, it would be better to use the wait(10000) method instead of sleep(10000) in the StandardServer.await() method. This would allow it to be woken by a notifyAll() call, or alternatively, use the interrupt() method to wake it up (if we know the thread).", "SR": ""}
