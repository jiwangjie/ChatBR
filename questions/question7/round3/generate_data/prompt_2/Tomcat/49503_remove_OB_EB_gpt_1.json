{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "When testing with trunk at revision 957942, it was observed that connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start(). This bug supposedly affects version 7.0.0 as well. In previous versions (such as TC6), there is a separate prestartup phase when starting Tomcat, which allows connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started. It is implemented by having separate methods Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start() [1]. This issue appears to break the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "Please provide observing behavior.", "EB": "Connectors should bind to their ports during Catalina.load() instead of waiting until start().", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
