Server not shut down.' However, Tomcat still shuts down properly. After printing the message, Catalina.stopServer() performs System.exit(1). It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina.server is not null.", "OB": "When using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service, an error message saying 'No shutdown port configured.
