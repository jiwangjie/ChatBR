This can be used to differentiate between the two use cases. There could be improvements in how Tomcat is stopped. Currently, using System.exit(0) would work regardless of the configuration. It is possible that jsvc may exhibit the same behavior, but this has not been tested.", "OB": "When running Tomcat as a service on Windows and specifying the shutdown port as 1 in the server.xml file, an error message is displayed during shutdown.", "EB": "During shutdown of the Windows service with shutdown port set to 1, no error message should be displayed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: \n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. \n2. Start the service. \n3. Stop the service. \n4. Shutdown the server using an OS signal or by calling Catalina.stop() method."}
