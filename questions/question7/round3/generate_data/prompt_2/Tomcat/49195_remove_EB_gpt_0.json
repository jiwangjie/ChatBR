That can be used to differentiate the two use cases. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. System.exit(0) would work regardless of all that. I suppose that jsvc may show the same behaviour, but I have not tried.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with Tomcat installed as a Windows service and then stopping the service, the following error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log:\n\n27.04.2010 17:49:13 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer\nSEVERE: No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.\n\nDespite this error message, Tomcat stops successfully. After printing the message, Catalina's stopServer() method performs System.exit(1), resulting in Tomcat shutdown. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null.", "EB": "The error message should not be printed when using 1 as the shutdown port with a Windows service.", "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n\n1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows.\n2. Start the service.\n3. Stop the service.\n4. Shut down the server through an OS signal, such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
