However, the observed behavior does not match the expected behavior.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie:\nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly\nBut the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid':\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "I expected the Reload link to be:\nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1.
