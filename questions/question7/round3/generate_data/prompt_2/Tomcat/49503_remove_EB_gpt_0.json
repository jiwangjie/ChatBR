Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. The first instance starts successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g. 80). This issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 and bug 48625, applied in r957960.\n\nThe second instance fails, but not in the expected way.\n\n3. Actual behavior: The exception does not occur because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It only binds when start() is called. The startup sequence continues but fails in Server.await().", "EB": "The connector should bind to the port in Catalina.load() instead of waiting until start() is called.\n\nThe startup sequence should fail and throw an exception in case of a port binding failure.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n\n1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
