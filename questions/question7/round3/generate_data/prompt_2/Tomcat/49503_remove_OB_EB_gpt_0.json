{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors are not binding to their ports in Catalina.load() but only later in start()", "description": "When testing with trunk at revision 957942, it was observed that connectors are not binding to their ports in the Catalina.load() phase but only later in the start() phase. This issue is believed to affect version 7.0.0 as well. In the previous version (Tomcat 6), there was a separate prestartup phase that allowed connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat were started. This was achieved by having separate methods Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start(). This issue seems to have re-introduced the problem fixed in BZ 48625. To reproduce the issue: 1. Start the first Tomcat instance successfully.", "OB": "NA", "EB": "NA", "SR": "1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties: org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true 2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."}
