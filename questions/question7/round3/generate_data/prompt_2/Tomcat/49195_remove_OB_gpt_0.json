{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message is printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, there is an error message printed when stopping Tomcat. It is suggested to improve the stopping mechanism in Tomcat by using wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it can be woken up by a notifyAll() call or using the interrupt() call to wake up the thread if known. This behavior may also be applicable to jsvc, but it has not been tested.", "OB": "When stopping the Tomcat service with <Server port=\"1\", an error message is printed.", "EB": "When stopping the Tomcat service with <Server port=\"1\", no error message should be printed.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Install Tomcat as a service on Windows. 2. Start the Tomcat service. 3. Stop the Tomcat service. 4. Shut down the server through an OS signal such as calling Catalina.stop()."}
