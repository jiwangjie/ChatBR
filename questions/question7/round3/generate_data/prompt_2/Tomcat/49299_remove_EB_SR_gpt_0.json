{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Incorrect behavior with custom cookie name and URL rewriting", "description": "The bug report is about the incorrect behavior regarding custom cookie name and URL rewriting as mentioned in Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1. Currently, when a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name is not used as the name of the URI parameter, even if URL rewriting has been enabled. The observed behavior is that the session ID is encoded in the URL using the default 'jsessionid' parameter instead of the custom cookie name. An attachment (cookiename.war) has been provided to demonstrate the issue.", "OB": "The page sends the following cookie: SetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. However, when the page is reloaded using the 'Reload' link, the URL uses 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name. Example URL: http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies and URL rewriting has been enabled, the custom name should also be used as the name of the URI parameter when the session ID is encoded in the URL.", "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Start the web application contained in the provided 'cookiename.war' file.\n2. Access the application using a web browser.\n3. Observe the cookie name and the URL parameter used for encoding the session ID.\n4. Reload the page and verify that the URL parameter still uses the default 'jsessionid' instead of the custom cookie name."}
