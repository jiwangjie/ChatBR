{"id": "49195", "title": "Bug 49195: Error message printed when using 1 as shutdown port with Windows service", "description": "When specifying <Server port=\"1\" in server.xml, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log. However, Tomcat still stops successfully. It seems that when the service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina server is not null. There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat, such as using wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await() or using interrupt() to wake the thread up if we know the thread.", "OB": "When using 1 as the shutdown port with the Windows service, an error message is printed in the catalina.20100427.log: 'No shutdown port configured. Server not shut down.'. However, the server actually stops after printing the message using the System.exit(1) function.", "EB": "Instead of using the sleep(10000) function in StandardServer.await(), it would be better to use wait(10000) so that the thread can be woken up by a notifyAll() call. Alternatively, if we know the thread, we can use the interrupt() function to wake it up.", "SR": ""}
