{"id": "49299", "title": "Bug 49299 - Custom cookie name does not affect URL rewriting", "description": "In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet30finalspec.pdf, it is mentioned that if a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL, provided that URL rewriting has been enabled. However, when testing with the attached war file 'cookiename.war', it is observed that the custom cookie name is not being used and instead the default 'jsessionid' is used in the URL parameter. This is unexpected and contrary to the specification.", "OB": "When accessing the page using the war file 'cookiename.war', the page sends a cookie with the following value: \nSetCookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly. However, the Reload link on the page uses 'jsessionid' in the URL parameter: \nhttp://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F4.", "EB": "The expected behavior is that the custom session tracking cookie name 'MYSESSIONCOOKIE' should also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session id is encoded in the URL, instead of the default 'jsessionid'.", "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Deploy the attached war file 'cookiename.war'\n2. Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/"}
