{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports in Catalina.load(), but only later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk revision 957942, this bug affects version 7.0.0 as well. In TC6, there is a separate prestartup phase where Connectors bind to their ports before the rest of Tomcat starts. This is done through separate methods Bootstrap.load(String[]) and Bootstrap.start(). This implementation breaks the fix for BZ 48625. To reproduce the issue: 1. The first instance starts successfully. ", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is not able to bind to privileged ports (e.g. 80). The issue is observed when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 applied in r957960. The second instance fails in an unexpected way. ", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
