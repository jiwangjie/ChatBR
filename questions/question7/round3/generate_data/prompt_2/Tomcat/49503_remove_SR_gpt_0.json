{"id": "49503", "title": "Connectors do not bind to their ports during Catalina.load() and only bind later in start()", "description": "Testing with trunk at revision 957942, so this issue presumably affects version 7.0.0 as well. In Tomcat 6, there is a separate pre-startup phase that allows Connectors to bind to their ports before the other parts of Tomcat start. This is implemented using separate methods `Bootstrap.load(String[])` and `Bootstrap.start()`. This issue breaks the fix for Bug 48625. To reproduce: 1. Start the first instance successfully.", "OB": "When running with jsvc, Tomcat is unable to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80). The issue is also observed when testing the fix for Bug 49030 and Bug 48625 in revision 957960, although jsvc is not used. The second instance fails in an unexpected way. 3. Actual behavior: The connector does not attempt to bind to the port, and instead binds only when `start()` is called. The startup sequence continues and then fails in `Server.await()`. ", "EB": "Expected behavior: In `StandardService.initInternal()`, the `connector.init()` call should fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from `connector.init()` should be caught there, and if the `EXITONINITFAILURE` flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in `Catalina.load()`, and finally rethrown as an `Error` to abort Tomcat startup. 4.
