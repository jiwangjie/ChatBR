# Your role is as a senior software development engineer, and you are very good at analyzing software defect reports. I will give you a bug report,   and your task  is to label each sentence in the bug report, the label are Observed Behavior (OB), Expected Behavior (EB),   Steps to Reproduce (S2R).
# **OB: it is the current software (mis)behavior, which is generally deemed to be incorrect or unexpected**
# **EB: it is the normal or correct software behavior as opposed to the
# Observed Behavior**
# **S2R: it is the list of actions that can be followed to replicate the Observed Behavior**
#
# **Only natural language content written by the reporters is allowed for labeling. Code snippets, stack traces, or logs must not be labeled.  A sentence or paragraph should explicitly describe any of the types of information to  be labeled as OB, EB, or S2R.**
#
# In the case of the OB,  uninformative sentences like "the system does not work" are not considered as OB unless they provide more details. Logs  and stack traces are not considered OB.
#
# Solutions to the bugs are not considered EB. This includes suggestions or recommendations to solve the bug (i.e., these are not considered EB either).   For example,  this one may be considered as EB: "Make Targets not automatically filled in for new Autotools project".
#
# In the case of S2R, the sentences may form a complete paragraph (then, the paragraph must be marked) or be part of a paragraph. Some bugs may have the steps to reproduce labeled with a phrase  like "to reproduce" or "steps to reproduce" The label sentence can't be considered S2R. The label should be follow at least 1 sentence describing S2R, for example: "Steps to reproduce:
# -Use 5.0 workspace settings
# -Create new project using wizard
# -Press next once
# -Configure some settings (sorry for the vague description)
# -Press back once"
#
# !!Note, your output must be consistent with the input BUG REPORT. You cannot output words that are not in the bug report!!
#
# **EXAMPLE**
# INPUT
# {
#     "bug_id": "2144",
#     "title": "Use Case property tab: Operations are not listed",
#     "description": "Operations are not listed in the Use Case Property Tab\nfurthermore, there is no possibility to create operations on use cases."
# }
# OUTPUT
# Certainly, I'll label the sentences in the provided JSON bug report according to the specified categories (OB, EB, S2R):
#
# **Input Bug Report:**
# ```json
# {
#   "bug_id": "2144",
#   "title": "Use Case property tab: Operations are not listed",
#   "description": "Operations are not listed in the Use Case Property Tab\nfurthermore, there is no possibility to create operations on use cases."
# }
# ```
#
# **Labeled Output:**
# ```xml
# <bug no-bug="" comments="">
#   <id>2144</id>
#   <title ob="x" eb="" s2r="">Use Case property tab: Operations are not listed</title>
#   <desc>
#     <parg ob="" eb="" s2r="">
#       <st ob="x" eb="" s2r="">Operations are not listed in the Use Case Property Tab.</st>
#       <st ob="" eb="" s2r="">Furthermore, there is no possibility to create operations on use cases.</st>
#     </parg>
#   </desc>
# </bug>
# ```
#
# Let's break down the labeling:
# - **Title**: "Use Case property tab: Operations are not listed"
#   - **OB**: "Operations are not listed"
# - **Description**:
#   - **Step 1**: "Operations are not listed in the Use Case Property Tab."
#     - **OB**: "Operations are not listed"
#   - **Step 2**: "Furthermore, there is no possibility to create operations on use cases."
