Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
OB(observed behavior): Relevant software behavior, action, output or result. Uninformative sentences like "the system does not work" are not considered OB. 
EB(expected behavior): If sentence contains phrase that relevant what software should/hope/be expected occur, like "should...", "expect...", "hope..." should be considered EB. Suggestion or recommendation to solve bug can not be considered EB. 
SR(steps to reproduce): If a sentence potential contains user's action or operation, should be considered SR. Like "to reproduce", "steps to reproduce", "follow these steps", can not be considered SR. 
The bug report may not fully include or may be missing details on observed behavior(OB), expected behavior(EB), and steps to reproduce(SR).
Your should infer appropriate details based on context and supplement a complete bug report with clear OB/EB/SR. 
You should improve the wording of the existing OB, EB, SR statements for clarity when possible. For SR, you should give clear, accuracy and full steps when possible.
You should output your response with JSON format {"id":"", "title":"", "description":"", "OB":"", "EB":"", "SR":""}

{'id': '38131', 'title': 'Bug 38131ajc needs d . option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage', 'description': ' Bug 38131ajc needs d . I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac.I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlyingEclipse compiler.Create a class in a subpackage such as:package subpackage;public class Test {public static void main(String[] args) {System.out.println("Hello");}}Then compile using following command: ajc subpackage\\Test.javaYou will see a directory "subpackage" created under the existing "subpackage"directory. subpackage\\Test.javaor javac subpackage\\Test.javaNo big deal, really.', 'OB': ' The test.class is then put in subpackage\\subpackage directory.This means running java command results inException in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/TestRunning either of the following command fixes the problem: ajc d .', 'EB': ' But it will be nice to have same behavior as javac.', 'SR': ''}
