Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
OB(observed behavior): Relevant software behavior, action, output or result. Uninformative sentences like "the system does not work" are not considered OB. 
EB(expected behavior): If sentence contains phrase that relevant what software should/hope/be expected occur, like "should...", "expect...", "hope..." should be considered EB. Suggestion or recommendation to solve bug can not be considered EB. 
SR(steps to reproduce): If a sentence potential contains user's action or operation, should be considered SR. Like "to reproduce", "steps to reproduce", "follow these steps", can not be considered SR. 
The bug report may not fully include or may be missing details on observed behavior(OB), expected behavior(EB), and steps to reproduce(SR).
Your should infer appropriate details based on context and supplement a complete bug report with clear OB/EB/SR. 
You should improve the wording of the existing OB, EB, SR statements for clarity when possible. For SR, you should give clear, accuracy and full steps when possible.
You should output your response with JSON format {"id":"", "title":"", "description":"", "OB":"", "EB":"", "SR":""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '37021', 'title': 'Bug 37021source path wrong in declare warning on binary files', 'description': ' Bug 37021source path wrong in declare warning on binary files [java|aj]".See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem.Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filenamechecking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. (I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes nosense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)', 'OB': ' In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form "app.Main.class" rather than "app/Main. I have also see the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do notreproduce that problem.', 'EB': '', 'SR': ''}
