Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
OB(observed behavior): Relevant software behavior, action, output or result. Uninformative sentences like "the system does not work" are not considered OB. 
EB(expected behavior): If sentence contains phrase that relevant what software should/hope/be expected occur, like "should...", "expect...", "hope..." should be considered EB. Suggestion or recommendation to solve bug can not be considered EB. 
SR(steps to reproduce): If a sentence potential contains user's action or operation, should be considered SR. Like "to reproduce", "steps to reproduce", "follow these steps", can not be considered SR. 
The bug report may not fully include or may be missing details on observed behavior(OB), expected behavior(EB), and steps to reproduce(SR).
Your should infer appropriate details based on context and supplement a complete bug report with clear OB/EB/SR. 
You should improve the wording of the existing OB, EB, SR statements for clarity when possible. For SR, you should give clear, accuracy and full steps when possible.
You should output your response with JSON format {"id":"", "title":"", "description":"", "OB":"", "EB":"", "SR":""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '131649', 'title': 'Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table', 'description': ' Bug 131649Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table This design uses a 2level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this:row["FIRSTNAME"] + " " + row["LASTNAME"] + " / " + row["OFFICECODE"]However this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on "COUNTRY" is to insertrows[0]["COUNTRY"]into the expression.The first index (an integer) to the "rows" array is the 0based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table etc.).', 'OB': '', 'EB': '', 'SR': ' Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). To do this double click on the inner list\'s Data Item to edit its expression. Click on "Available Data Sets", choose data set "offices", then double click on column "COUNTRY".'}
