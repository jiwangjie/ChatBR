Your role is a senior software engineer, you are very good at analyzing and writing bug reports.
OB(observed behavior): Relevant software behavior, action, output or result. Uninformative sentences like "the system does not work" are not considered OB. 
EB(expected behavior): If sentence contains phrase that relevant what software should/hope/be expected occur, like "should...", "expect...", "hope..." should be considered EB. Suggestion or recommendation to solve bug can not be considered EB. 
SR(steps to reproduce): If a sentence potential contains user's action or operation, should be considered SR. Like "to reproduce", "steps to reproduce", "follow these steps", can not be considered SR. 
The bug report may not fully include or may be missing details on observed behavior(OB), expected behavior(EB), and steps to reproduce(SR).
Your should infer appropriate details based on context and supplement a complete bug report with clear OB/EB/SR. 
You should improve the wording of the existing OB, EB, SR statements for clarity when possible. For SR, you should give clear, accuracy and full steps when possible.
You should output your response with JSON format {"id":"", "title":"", "description":"", "OB":"", "EB":"", "SR":""}

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '50016', 'title': 'Bug 50016bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods', 'description': ' Bug 50016bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods Created attachment 26089 [details]improve division of responsibility for isUserInRole and login/logout methodsThere are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility.1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong.In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.', 'OB': ' If the user is not in the mapped role the original role is tested. However,(a). The implementation of the new login and logout methods are excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. In particular, checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/pw login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed.', 'EB': ' So to be reasonably amenable to a jacc implementation Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and if possible the servlet name to the wrapper. (b) if there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. A user that logs in and is in role A and not B should be able to test in Sis in Afalseis in BtrueThe current implementation reports true for both A and B.2. Both should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. The authenticator also ought to be able to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results.', 'SR': ''}
