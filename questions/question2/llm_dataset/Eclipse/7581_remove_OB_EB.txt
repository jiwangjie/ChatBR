EB(expected behavior): If sentence contains phrase that relevant what software should/hope/be expected occur, like "should...", "expect...", "hope..." should be considered EB. Suggestion or recommendation to solve bug can not be considered EB. 
SR(steps to reproduce): If a sentence potential contains user's action or operation, should be considered SR. Like "to reproduce", "steps to reproduce", "follow these steps", can not be considered SR.

Your should infer appropriate details based on context and supplement a complete bug report with clear OB/EB/SR. 
You should improve the wording of the existing OB, EB, SR statements for clarity when possible. For SR, you should give clear, accuracy and full steps when possible.

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '7581', 'title': 'Bug 7581ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in propery sheet', 'description': ' From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...', 'OB': '', 'EB': '', 'SR': ' The PropertySheetViewer lets me edit objects using a set of row that are name value pairs in two columns, with each column being defined by an IPropertyDescriptor.IPropertyDescriptor has a method to create a cell editor, and I use this to create editors that include ComboBoxCellEditorconstructor of which can be given the strings.The editor appears in column two of the property sheet and the drop down button appears at the right edge of the column.A problem occurs if any of my strings is wider that the width of the property sheet column.It appears that the combo box grows to be the width of the largest itemthe problem is that the drop down button may now be too far right and off the visible area of the property sheet so it is clipped.From a user experience they can no longer see the combo drop down button without making the property sheet view wider until the button comes into the visible area.'}
