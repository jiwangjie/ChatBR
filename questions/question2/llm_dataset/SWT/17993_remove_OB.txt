EB(expected behavior): If sentence contains phrase that relevant what software should/hope/be expected occur, like "should...", "expect...", "hope..." should be considered EB. Suggestion or recommendation to solve bug can not be considered EB. 
SR(steps to reproduce): If a sentence potential contains user's action or operation, should be considered SR. Like "to reproduce", "steps to reproduce", "follow these steps", can not be considered SR.

<BUG REPORT>
{'id': '17993', 'title': "Bug 17993Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history", 'description': ' It wouldbe better if what I type isn\'t replaced with a value from the history.The current behaviour seems to be similar to "autocomplete" which isparticularly common in browsers. In the future, perhaps, a full "autocomplete"feature could be provided.', 'OB': '', 'EB': " Bug 17993Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history For me, it isvery common to perform operations like this.I think the current behaviour to be changed to something more simple whichallows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed. But this should still respect the case of what theuser types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.To reproduce: Open a document so that EditFind/Replace... becomes available. You shouldn't be able to.The behaviour is similar for the Replace With field.", 'SR': ' When you type in the "Find" or "Replace With" fields itsearches for entries from a previous search. For example, searching for "hello" and replacing it with "hi" thensearching for "Hello" and replacing it with "Hi" is not possible. Choose EditFind/Replace... Type "a" into the Find field. Click "Find". Try to type "A" into the Find field.'}
