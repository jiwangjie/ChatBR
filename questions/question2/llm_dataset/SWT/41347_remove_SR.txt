A typical user of a combobox would be vert surprised to have thedialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected.", 'OB': " If you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry usingthe mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection. Standard Combos won'tdo this.Because of this you can't tell the difference between just selecting an entryusing the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo.", 'EB': " It shouldfire a selection instead.Default selection means something was selected and you should go and dosomething. The typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog.A combo shouldn't fire default selection from just selecting an entry in thedropdown. Hittingenter from the text field should be treated as default selection.", 'SR': ''}
