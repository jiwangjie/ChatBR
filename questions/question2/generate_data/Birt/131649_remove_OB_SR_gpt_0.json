  "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table",
  "description": "Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this: row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]. However, this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on \"COUNTRY\" is to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the \"rows\" array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first-level inner table, etc.).",
  "OB": "The designer generates incorrect column reference expressions when using a 2-level table. It attempts to reference columns as if they were in the outermost table.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the report designer should correctly determine the index number by considering the nesting levels of all tables and generate the appropriate column reference expressions.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a 2-level table design listing offices and their employees.\n2. Construct an expression using column references, such as row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"].\n3. Attempt to run the report.\n4. Double-click on the \"COUNTRY\" column to insert a reference, expecting rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] to be inserted."
