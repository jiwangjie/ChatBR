  "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand",
  "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.",
  "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter; however, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand. Instead of populating the entire tree on load, it should only load the schema information when the user interacts with the schema filter or when a specific schema is selected. This way, the warning message on load should not appear, and the user should be able to navigate the tables and columns more efficiently.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.\n2. Navigate to the schema section.\n3. Notice that the entire list of schemas is loaded on the initial page load, causing a warning message.\n4. Interact with the schema filter or select a specific schema to see if the tables and columns are loaded on demand as expected."
