  "OB": "While working in the Library Explorer, I opened the Library tree of A and tried to drag and drop themes from Library B into the layout. The actual result was an error message that indicated the library namespace 'B' already exists. The error message did not provide information on how to resolve the issue, and I'm unsure if this method can be used.",
