  "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.",
  "OB": "When the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, and it eventually results in a message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...'.",
  "EB": "The JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand, so the schema is not queried in its entirety when the editor is opened. Users should not encounter the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the entire schema is queried automatically, resulting in the 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' message."
