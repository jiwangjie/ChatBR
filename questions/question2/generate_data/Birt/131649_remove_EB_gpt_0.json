  "description": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. So you can construct an expression like this: row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]. However, this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on \"COUNTRY\" is to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the \"rows\" array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first-level inner table, etc.).",
  "OB": "The problem is that row[\"OFFICECODE\"] is not valid in the inner table. In order for the inner table to access the outer table's columns, the expression needs to use the \"rows\" object.",
  "EB": "When the user double clicks on \"COUNTRY,\" the expected behavior is for the expression to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign).\n2. Double click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression.\n3. Click on \"Available Data Sets,\" choose data set \"offices,\" then double click on column \"COUNTRY.\""
