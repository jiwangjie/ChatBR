  "title": "Bug 122423 - Support page range in RenderTask",
  "description": "When using RenderTask, there is an issue with supporting page ranges. If a page range is specified, it should be parsed and output accordingly. For PDF format, a message should be logged indicating that page ranges are not supported, and the whole report should still be output. For HTML format, page ranges should be supported in the format of '1,2,510' + 'All'. If an invalid page number is provided, it should be logged, and an error message should be returned.",
  "OB": "In the current implementation of RenderTask, there is no support for handling page ranges. For PDF format, when a range is specified, the software does not log any message and still outputs the entire report. For HTML format, page ranges in the format '1,2,510' + 'All' are not recognized, and there is no handling of invalid page numbers. The software does not log any error messages for invalid page numbers in the HTML format.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is to add support for page ranges in RenderTask. For PDF format, when a page range is specified, the software should log a message indicating that page ranges are not supported but continue to output the entire report as it currently does. For HTML format, page ranges should be recognized in the format '1,2,510' + 'All', and if an invalid page number is provided, the software should log an error message and return the appropriate error response.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue for PDF format:\n1. Perform a RenderTask with a page range specified, e.g., '2-5'.\n2. Check the log for any messages regarding page range support.\n3. Verify that the entire report is still output without any error.\n\nTo reproduce the issue for HTML format:\n1. Perform a RenderTask with a page range specified, e.g., '1,2,510,All'.\n2. Check the log for any messages regarding page range support.\n3. Verify that the page ranges are not recognized and there are no error messages for invalid page numbers."
