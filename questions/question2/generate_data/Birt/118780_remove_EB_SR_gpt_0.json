  "title": "Set alias for columns in data set but in expression builder still shows the old column names when selecting the dataset.",
  "description": "When attempting to set aliases for columns within a data set, the expression builder does not reflect these aliases, and instead, it continues to display the old column names when selecting the dataset.",
  "OB": "In the expression builder, even after setting aliases for columns in a data set, the old column names are displayed when selecting the dataset.",
  "EB": "I would expect that the expression builder reflects the aliases I've set for the columns in the data set. It should display the new column names, corresponding to the aliases, when selecting the dataset.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application and load a data set that contains columns with names you want to alias.\n2. Go to the data set configuration or settings.\n3. Set aliases for the columns, giving them new names.\n4. Open the expression builder.\n5. Attempt to select the dataset in the expression builder, and you will observe that the old column names are displayed instead of the aliases."
