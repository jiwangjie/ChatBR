  "description": "When attempting to change the content type to dynamic text, it doesn't have the expected impact on the system. The issue is causing a disruption in our workflow.",
  "OB": "When we select the dynamic text content type option, it doesn't update the content as it should.",
  "EB": "We expect that when choosing the dynamic text content type, the content displayed should change dynamically based on user interactions and data updates. It should adapt and show real-time changes without requiring manual refresh.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Log in to the application.\n2. Navigate to the 'Content Type' settings in the user profile or content editor.\n3. Choose 'Dynamic Text' as the content type for a specific piece of content.\n4. Observe that the content remains static and does not dynamically update as expected, even when data changes occur. It should update without any additional user action."
