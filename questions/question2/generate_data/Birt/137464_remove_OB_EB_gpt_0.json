  "description": "When applying a filter on a Join dataset in the chart editor's select data page, the data preview section does not update as expected.",
  "OB": "After applying a filter on a Join dataset in the chart editor's select data page, the data preview section does not refresh or display the filtered data.",

  "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Open the attached file. 2. Create a chart and navigate to the 'Select Data' page. 3. Choose the 'Join dataset' option and set the X and Y series. 4. Apply a filter to the dataset and observe that the data preview section does not refresh to show the filtered data."
