  "title": "Bug 124620 - Referenced Parameter icon remains valid after source parameter deletion",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When you create a library and reference a parameter from that library in a report design file, the referenced parameter icon appears to be valid. However, if you delete the source parameter in the library, the referenced parameter icon in the report design file does not change. It remains valid. On the other hand, if you perform similar operations in a dataset, the icon of the dataset in the report becomes invalid.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the icon of the referenced parameter should become invalid in the report design file when the source parameter in the library is deleted. In other words, when the source parameter is no longer available in the library, the referenced parameter icon should reflect this change and appear as invalid.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a library. 2. Reference a parameter from the library in a report design file. 3. Delete the source parameter in the library. Expected Result: The icon of the referenced parameter in the report design file should become invalid to indicate that the source parameter is no longer available."
