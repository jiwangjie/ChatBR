  "title": "Bug 132786 - Value2 not cleaned after converting operator from between to equal in highlight rule",
  "description": "When setting a highlight rule with '2 between 1 and 3, color blue' and then converting it to '1 equal 1, color blue', the value2 is not being cleaned as expected.",
  "OB": "After saving the report and examining the generated XML source, the observed behavior is that in the XML source, 'value2' is not being cleaned in the highlight expression. Instead, 'value1' is shown as 1, and 'value2' is shown as 3.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when converting the operator from 'between' to 'equal' in the highlight rule, 'value2' should be cleaned in the highlight expression, and 'value2' should not be present in the generated XML source.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Insert data into the report.\n2. Set a highlight rule in the Property Editor with '2 between 1 and 3, color blue'.\n3. Save the report.\n4. Modify the highlight rule, changing it to '1 equal 1, color blue'.\n5. Save the report again and check the generated XML source for the unexpected behavior."
