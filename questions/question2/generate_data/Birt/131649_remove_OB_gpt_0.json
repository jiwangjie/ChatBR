  "title": "Bug 131649 - Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table",
  "description": "Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table. This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. You can construct an expression like this: row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]. However, this report will not run. The correct behavior when the user double-clicks on \"COUNTRY\" is to insert rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the \"rows\" array is the 0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first-level inner table, etc.).",
  "OB": "When double-clicking on \"COUNTRY\" in the report, the generated expression does not insert the correct reference to the country column, making the report fail to run.",
  "EB": "The report designer should automatically determine the correct index number by analyzing the nesting levels of all tables and should generate the expression as rows[0][\"COUNTRY\"].",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign).\n2. Double-click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression.\n3. Click on \"Available Data Sets,\" choose the data set \"offices,\" then double-click on the column \"COUNTRY.\""
