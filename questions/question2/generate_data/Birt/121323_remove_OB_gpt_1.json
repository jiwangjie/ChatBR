  "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not saving filter information when exiting, causing data stored in filterInfo to be lost.",
  "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist the filter information entered by the user. When I enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], it gets stripped of and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, when I leave the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is lost.",
  "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should save and persist the filter information entered by the user. This means that when I enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'], it should not strip the selection and should ensure that the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is retained when leaving the dialog.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, e.g., section[@id='left'].\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Close the dialog and leave it.\n5. Check if the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost. It should be retained when leaving the dialog."
