  "title": "XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
  "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not properly retain filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part is entered for column mapping. When leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is stored in .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo HashMap is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this manner may lead to various issues. The user suggests allowing the use of plain XPath expressions, with the path from the data set selector prepended, and letting filtering be an optional feature for those who require it.",
  "OB": "When entering an XPath expression for column mapping that includes a selection part, such as section[@id='left'], the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the class RelationInformation. However, upon exiting the dialog, the data stored in filterInfo is not persisted, resulting in the loss of this filtering information. This behavior could potentially lead to issues.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that the XML Edit Data Set dialog retains the entire XPath expression, including any selection part, for column mapping. When leaving the dialog, both the RelationInformation and the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be persisted. It would be more user-friendly to allow the use of plain XPath expressions, with the path from the data set selector prepended, and to offer filtering as an optional feature for users who require it.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for column mapping that includes a selection part (e.g., section[@id='left']).\n3. Observe that the selection part is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within RelationInformation.\n4. Exit the dialog.\n5. Check if the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost upon leaving the dialog."
