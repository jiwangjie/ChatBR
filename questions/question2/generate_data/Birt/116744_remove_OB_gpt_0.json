"description": "",
"OB": "The dynamic text element's Content Type property does not affect the displayed results. Regardless of whether I set it to Auto, Plain, or HTML, the report shows the same content.",
"EB": "I expect the report to display different results based on the dynamic text element's Content Type property setting. Specifically, for Plain, I expect the literal content (including tags) to be displayed. For Auto, I expect content 1, 2, and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags. For HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 to appear literally with RTF tags. See the attached report for reference.",
"SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a database field with three types of content:\n a. HTML text within <html ...</html> tags.\n b. HTML fragments not within <html> tags.\n c. Text with RTF tags.\n2. Use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field in a report."
