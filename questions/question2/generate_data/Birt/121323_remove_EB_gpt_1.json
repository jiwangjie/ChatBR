  "title": "Bug 121323: XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
  "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not persisting filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part is used for column mapping. The selection part is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class, but when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign while the data stored in filterInfo is lost. Treating XPath expressions in this manner may lead to potential issues.",
  "OB": "In the XML Edit Data Set dialog, if an XPath expression is entered for the column mapping, including a selection part like section[@id='left'], the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class. However, when leaving the dialog, the RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost.",
  "EB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information when an XPath expression with a selection part is used for column mapping. The selection should not be stripped, and the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should be preserved when leaving the dialog.",
  "SR": "1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping, for example, section[@id='left'].\n3. Notice that the selection part is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap within the RelationInformation class.\n4. Close the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n5. Check the .rptdesign file for the persisted RelationInformation data and confirm that the data stored in filterInfo is lost."
