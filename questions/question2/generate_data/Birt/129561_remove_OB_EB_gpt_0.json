  "description": "Bug 129561HCGBIDI: Undesirable generation of SQL query elements. This is not even NLS specific defect. Otherwise the query will fail.",
  "OB": "When creating a table with a name that includes a space in this database and selecting 'Preview Results', an exception is fired. The issue is related to the 'Table Name' and 'Column Name'.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that creating a table with a name containing a space and selecting 'Preview Results' should not result in an exception being fired. The query should execute without errors.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a DB2 database.\n2. Ensure it has a column with a name containing a space.\n3. Create a Data Source based on the database from step 1.\n4. Create a Data Set based on the table from Step 2.\n5. On the Query screen, drag and drop the column name from step 2 into the 'select' portion of the clause.\n6. Manually change the SQL query as follows: 'SELECT USER.'"
