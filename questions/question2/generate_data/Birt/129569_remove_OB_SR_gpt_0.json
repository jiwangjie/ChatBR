  "description": "This is a BiDI-specific defect. The issue occurs when performing a SQL query. Please follow the steps below to reproduce the problem.",
  "OB": "When executing the SQL query, the order of BiDI characters in the query window is not as expected.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the order of BiDI characters in the query window should match the order in the SQL query. To achieve this, add the following condition to the 'where' portion of the SQL query: tomer.tomerREMOT.EMANNMULOC != 'OLLEH world'.",
  "SR": "1. Open the SQL query window.\n2. Execute the following SQL query: 'select tomer.tomerEMANNMULOC.REMOT from tomer.tomerREMOT where tomer.tomerREMOT.EMANNMULOC != 'OLLEH world'.\n3. Observe the order of BiDI characters in the query window and note any discrepancies."
