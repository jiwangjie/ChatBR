  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the attached file from bug 124598.\n2. In the file, locate the second table, which has a list/grid nested in its group header and a merged group header row.\n3. Select the second column in the table.\n4. Press the delete key on your keyboard.\n5. Observe the differing behavior when using the delete key."
