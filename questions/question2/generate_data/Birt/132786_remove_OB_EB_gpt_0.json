  "title": "Value2 not cleaned after converting operator from 'between' to 'equal' in highlight rule",
  "description": "When setting a highlight rule with '2 between 1 and 3, color blue', Value2 is not cleared after converting the operator to '1 equal 1, color blue'.",
  "OB": "The Value2 field retains the value '3' even after changing the operator from 'between' to 'equal' in the highlight rule.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when changing the operator from 'between' to 'equal' in the highlight rule, the Value2 field should be cleared or set to a default value, as it is no longer applicable to the 'equal' operator.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the bug:\n1. Insert data into the system.\n2. Set a highlight rule in the Property Editor with '2 between 1 and 3, color blue'.\n3. Save the report.\n4. Modify the highlight rule and change the operator to '1 equal 1, color blue'."
