  "title": "Bug 121323 - XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information",
  "description": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog is not saving filter information when using XPath expressions with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']'. The data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost when leaving the dialog. This behavior may lead to problems.",
  "OB": "When using XPath expressions for column mapping with a selection part like 'section[@id='left']' in the XML Edit Data Set dialog, the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap. However, upon leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap is lost.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the XML Edit Data Set dialog should persist the filter information, including the XPath expressions with selection parts. When leaving the dialog, the data stored in the filterInfo HashMap should not be lost, ensuring that the filter information is retained.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for column mapping with a selection part, e.g., 'section[@id='left']'.\n3. Observe that the selection is stripped and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Click 'OK' to leave the dialog.\n5. Return to the XML Edit Data Set dialog and check if the filter information, including the XPath expression, is still present in the filterInfo HashMap. Note that it is lost, which is the issue."
