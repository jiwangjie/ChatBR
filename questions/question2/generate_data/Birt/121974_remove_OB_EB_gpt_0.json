  "title": "Global Expressions Evaluation Issue in BIRT Scripting Environment",
  "description": "When working with global expressions in the BIRT scripting environment, such as {params['p1']}, {new DateTime()}, they should always be available and evaluable regardless of the iteration context. However, currently, Dte scriptExpression has three types: BEFOREFIRSTROW, AFTERLASTROW, ONEACHROW, and a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException is thrown when trying to evaluate these expressions. In reality, these global expressions should not be tied to the data row iteration.",
  "OB": "When attempting to evaluate global expressions like {params['p1']} and {new DateTime()} in the BIRT scripting environment, a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException is thrown.",
  "EB": "Global expressions, such as {params['p1']} and {new DateTime()}, should be available and evaluable within the BIRT scripting environment regardless of the iteration context. They should not trigger a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException.",
  "SR": "1. Open the BIRT scripting environment.\n2. Use global expressions like {params['p1']} or {new DateTime()}.\n3. Observe that a 'QueryResults or its iterator has been closed' DataException is thrown when attempting to evaluate these expressions, even when not within the data row iteration. This behavior should not occur."
