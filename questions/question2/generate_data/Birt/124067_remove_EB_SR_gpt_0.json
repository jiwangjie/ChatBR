  "description": "Bug 124067: When selecting an XML file, the relative path should be supported.",
  "OB": "When selecting the XML file, the software currently only supports the use of absolute file paths. The actual result is that it does not allow the use of relative paths.",
  "EB": "When selecting an XML file, we expect the software to support both relative and absolute file paths.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Select 'Open XML File' from the menu.\n3. Choose an XML file using a relative path (e.g., '../folder/file.xml').\n4. Observe that the software does not allow the selection and reports an error related to the relative path."
