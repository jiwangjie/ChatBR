  "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.",
  "OB": "On the iSeries platform using the JTOpenJDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easily several hundred tables. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter; however, I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load.",
  "EB": "I expect the JDBC Data Set Editor to load tables and columns on demand, rather than querying the entire schema on load. This would improve performance and prevent the warning message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...' from appearing.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor.\n2. Observe that the entire schema is queried on load, and you receive the warning message. This behavior is not as expected, as it should load tables and columns on demand. The expected behavior is that the schema should only be queried when necessary, for example, when the user interacts with the tree control or requests specific information."
