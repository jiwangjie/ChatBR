  "description": "When setting aliases for columns in a dataset, the Expression Builder still displays the old column names when selecting the dataset.",
  "OB": "After setting an alias for a column in a dataset, the Expression Builder continues to show the original column names when selecting the dataset.",
  "EB": "When setting an alias for a column in a dataset, the expected behavior is that the Expression Builder should display the newly assigned alias name when selecting the dataset.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new datasource and a dataset.\n2. Set an alias for the first column in the dataset, for example, set it to 'column1'.\n3. Insert a data item and bind it to the dataset in the Expression Builder."
