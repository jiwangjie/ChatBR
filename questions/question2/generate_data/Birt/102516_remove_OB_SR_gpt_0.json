  "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.",
  "OB": "When opening the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query, the entire schema is loaded immediately, causing a delay in the user interface.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is to defer the loading of the tree until the user either expands the tree or applies a filter. This would improve the loading time and user experience.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the entire schema is loaded without any user interaction, causing a delay."
