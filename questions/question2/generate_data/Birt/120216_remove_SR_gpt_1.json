  "description": "When attempting to define a group, the group dialog is not displayed when the dataset is not set. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure that users can define a group even in the absence of a dataset.",
  "OB": "An error is shown when attempting to define a group, and the group dialog is not displayed.",
  "EB": "The group dialog should be displayed when a user attempts to define a group, even if the dataset is not defined. Users should be able to go ahead and define a group without any hindrance from the UI. There should be no error message or validation blocking this process.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to the 'Groups' section.\n3. Try to create a new group without defining a dataset.\n4. Observe that the group dialog does not appear, and an error is displayed instead."
