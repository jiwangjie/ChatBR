  "title": "Bug 102436 - Date/time value not stored correctly in report design",
  "description": "An invalid date/time string (which does not conform to a universal format or the system default locale format) should have been rejected.",
  "OB": "When a 'DateTime' type report parameter is created in the BIRT report designer, and an invalid date string like '55/66/9999' is entered in the 'default value' field, the invalid value is accepted, and the following definition shows up in the report design.",
  "EB": "The system should reject invalid date/time strings, such as '55/66/9999,' when entered in the 'default value' field for a 'DateTime' type report parameter in the BIRT report designer.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT report designer.\n2. Create a new report parameter of type 'DateTime.'\n3. In the 'default value' field, type in an invalid date string, for example, '55/66/9999.'\n4. Observe that the invalid value is accepted and appears in the report design."
