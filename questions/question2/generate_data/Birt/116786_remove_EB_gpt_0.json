  "title": "Bug 116786 - Library include should store relative path.",
  "description": "When including libraries in a report design, the software is currently storing the absolute path instead of the relative path, which is causing issues. This bug report aims to address this problem.",
  "OB": "In the current software behavior, I observed that the report design is storing the absolute path of the included library. For example, it stores the path as follows: <property name='fileName' value='E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'></property><property name='namespace' value='lib1'></property>.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a library is included in a report design, the software should generate and save the relative path instead of the absolute path. For instance, it should save the path as: <property name='fileName' value='$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary'></property>.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the BIRT designer.\n2. Create or open a project in a directory, for example, '$project/test'.\n3. Include a library from a different location, such as '$project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary' in your report design.\n4. Observe that the software stores the absolute path instead of the relative path for the included library."
