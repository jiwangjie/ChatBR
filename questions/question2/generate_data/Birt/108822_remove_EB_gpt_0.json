  "title": "Improvement Needed for Disk Sorting Logic with Border Row Values",
  "description": "The current logic for disk sorting needs improvement, especially when dealing with border row values. The bug report lacks expected behavior (EB), so we'll add that based on context. Also, the observed behavior (OB) and steps to reproduce (SR) need clarification and expansion.",
  "OB": "When sorting data on disk, if there are 40,000 rows to be sorted and the program is configured to process data less than 40,000 rows, it performs the following operations:",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that when sorting on disk with 40,000 rows of data and the program is set to process less than 40,000 rows, it should efficiently handle the sorting process, ensuring no data loss or corruption during these operations.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue and demonstrate the need for improvement in disk sorting logic with border row values, follow these steps:\n1. Configure the program to process less than 40,000 rows of data.\n2. Initiate a disk sorting operation.\n3. Observe the sequence of operations, including saving the file as a temporary file, loading the file into memory, sorting the data, and saving the sorted file as a temporary file."
