  "title": "JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand",
  "description": "The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source.",
  "OB": "Currently, when the data set editor is opened, the entire schema is queried, and it takes some time to load. Eventually, a message appears stating 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list.'",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the load of the tree should be deferred until the user either expands the tree or applies a filter. This would improve the loading time and user experience. Bug 101372 requests the ability to filter based on schema.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the JDBC Data Set Editor for a SQL Query.\n2. Observe that the entire schema is queried and loading takes time.\n3. Eventually, you will see the message 'Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list.'"
