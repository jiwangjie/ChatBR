  "OB": "The XML Edit Data Set dialog does not retain filter information when leaving the dialog. Filter information is lost upon exiting the dialog.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the XML Edit Data Set dialog should retain the filter information entered by the user. Users should be able to use plain XPath expressions, prepended with the path from the data set selector, and let filtering be optional for those who need it.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the XML Edit Data Set dialog.\n2. Enter an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part, for example: section[@id='left'].\n3. Note that within the class RelationInformation, the selection is stripped off and stored in the filterInfo HashMap.\n4. Exit the dialog.\n5. Check that when leaving the dialog, RelationInformation is persisted to .rptdesign, but the data stored in filterInfo is lost. The filter information should have been retained.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that treating XPath expressions in this way may lead to various issues."
