  "title": "Bug 13725 Revert is much slower than close and reopen in Java editor",
  "description": "The bug report addresses a performance issue where the 'Revert' operation is significantly slower than the 'Close and Reopen' operation in the Java editor.",
  "OB": "When I open an editor for the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java and make changes to the file (mark it as dirty), it takes about 8 seconds to close the editor, answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog, and then double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it. However, if I repeat the same steps and select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor, it takes 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window with the original.",
  "EB": "I expect that the 'Revert' operation in the Java editor should perform as fast as the 'Close and Reopen' operation when applied to a dirty file. It should not take significantly longer to revert changes.",
  "SR": "1. Start by opening an editor for the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open-source repository.\n2. Make changes to the file, marking it as dirty (e.g., add a space character to the end of the first line).\n3. Close the editor by clicking on the close box in the editor tab.\n4. When prompted, answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n5. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it and observe the time it takes.\n6. Repeat steps 1 and 2.\n7. Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n8. Observe the time it takes for the 'Revert' operation to replace the contents of the window with the original."
