The problem is observed in a Japanese language environment running on RedHat 8 with GTK 2.2 and IBM JDK 1.3.1.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior section lacks specific details. Please provide a clear description of what happens when the core dump occurs.",

Select the CVS repository.\n4. Choose the option 'Use project name as module name' and click 'Finish.'\n5. Select the project in the Synchronize view.\n6. Right-click on the project and choose 'Add Version Control.'\n7. Right-click on the project and select 'Commit.'\n8. Right-click on the project and select 'Delete' (Choose 'also delete contents under /workspace folder name').\n9. Change the perspective to the 'CVS Perspective.'\n10.
