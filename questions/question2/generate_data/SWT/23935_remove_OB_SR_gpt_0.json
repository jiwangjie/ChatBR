  "title": "Bug 23935 - Focus Issue with Text Widget in a Tree Parent",
  "description": "This bug report addresses a focus issue involving a Text widget when it is a child of a Tree widget, and both are children of a shell. The report mentions that the issue only affects Windows and suggests a potential workaround by making the text editor a sibling of the tree and positioning it above the tree.",
  "OB": "The bug report does not specify the observed behavior or the problem's nature. To understand the issue better, it's crucial to describe what occurs when the Text widget is used within the Tree widget.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is provided in the bug report. It is expected that, with build 20020920, the left tree and text should function correctly on both Windows and Linux, behaving as intended.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue and validate the expected behavior:\n1. Use build 20020920.\n2. Run the attached code.\n3. Observe that the left tree and text should behave correctly on both Windows and Linux.\n4. Specifically, check if the Text widget loses focus as intended when interacting with the Tree widget."
