  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'Revert' operation in the Java editor should perform at a speed similar to the 'Close and Reopen' operation when applied to a dirty file. It should not take significantly longer to revert changes.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start by opening an editor for the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open-source repository.\n2. Make changes to the file, marking it as dirty (e.g., add a space character to the end of the first line).\n3. Close the editor by clicking on the close box in the editor tab.\n4. When prompted, answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n5. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it and observe the time it takes.\n6. Repeat steps 1 and 2.\n7. Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n8. Observe the time it takes for the 'Revert' operation to replace the contents of the window with the original."
