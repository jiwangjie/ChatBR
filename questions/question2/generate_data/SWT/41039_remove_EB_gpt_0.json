  "description": "The bug report addresses an issue where hitting the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog on Mac OS X does not perform the expected 'Find' operation.",
  "OB": "When using Eclipse 3.0 M2 on Mac OS X 10.2.6, the following behavior is observed:\n1. Open the Find/Replace dialog (Edit -> Find/Replace).\n2. Type in a search term into the text box.\n3. Hit the Return key.\n\nHowever, when the Return key is pressed, nothing happens. The expected behavior is that hitting the Return key should perform a 'Find' operation, which is the same as clicking on the 'Find' button in the Find/Replace dialog. The 'Find' button is highlighted as the default action.",
