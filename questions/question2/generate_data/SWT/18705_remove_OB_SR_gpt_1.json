  "description": "The issue of excessive flashing in the Control Example needs to be addressed.",
  "OB": "In the Control Example, when interacting with the user interface elements, there is excessive and distracting flashing of the entire frame, making the user experience unpleasant and potentially causing discomfort.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that only the bottom edge of the outermost frames should be repainted during user interactions. This will reduce the flashing and provide a smoother and more visually pleasing user experience.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Control Example application.\n2. Interact with any of the user interface elements, such as buttons, sliders, or input fields.\n3. Observe the excessive flashing that occurs when interacting with these elements."
