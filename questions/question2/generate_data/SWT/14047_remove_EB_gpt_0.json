  "title": "Bug 14047 StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap",
  "description": "The report addresses an issue related to the inefficient redraw behavior of the StyledText component during text changes in word wrap mode.",
  "OB": "When appending N lines to StyledText in word wrap mode, it results in N redraws of the entire client area, which is an inefficient behavior.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that appending N lines to StyledText in word wrap mode should not trigger N redraws of the entire client area. Instead, it should efficiently update only the affected parts of the text display.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue and observe the inefficient redraws:\n1. Add the following line to the 'StyledText.performPaint' method to log redraw information:\n   System.out.println('lineCount ' + lineCount + ', paintY ' + paintY + ', renderHeight ' + renderHeight);\nThis will help in understanding the extent of the issue and potential areas for optimization."
