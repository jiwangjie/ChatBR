  "title": "Bug 23935 - Focus Issue with Text Widget in a Tree Parent",
  "description": "This bug report concerns a focus issue with a Text widget when it's a child of a Tree widget, and both are children of a shell. The issue is stated to only affect Windows, and a potential workaround is suggested, involving making the text editor a sibling of the tree and positioning it above the tree.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is not explicitly described in the bug report. It's important to provide details about what happens when interacting with the Text widget within the Tree widget to understand the issue fully.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is mentioned in the bug report, but it is not very clear. The software should behave correctly on both Windows and Linux, where the left tree and text should behave as expected.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Use build 20020920.\n2. Run the attached code.\n3. Observe that the left tree and text should behave correctly on both Windows and Linux.\n4. Specifically, check if clicking anywhere in the tree gives the tree focus as expected."
