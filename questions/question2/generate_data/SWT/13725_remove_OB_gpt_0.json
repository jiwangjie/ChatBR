  "title": "Bug 13725 Revert is much slower than close and reopen in Java editor",
  "description": "The report highlights a performance issue where the 'Revert' operation takes significantly more time than the 'Close and Reopen' operation in the Java editor.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that the 'Revert' operation is significantly slower than the 'Close and Reopen' operation when applied to a dirty file.",
  "EB": "It is expected that the 'Revert' operation should not take significantly more time than closing and reopening a dirty file. Reverting the file contents should be equally fast or even faster than the alternative action.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start by opening an editor for the file org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder 'Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets' in the project 'org.eclipse.swt' in the open-source repository.\n2. Make changes to the file, marking it as dirty (e.g., add a space character to the end of the first line).\n3. Close the editor by clicking on the close box in the editor tab.\n4. When prompted, answer 'no' to the 'do you want to save changes' dialog.\n5. Double-click on the file in the navigator to reopen it and observe the time it takes.\n6. Repeat steps 1 and 2.\n7. Select 'Revert' from the pop-up menu in the editor.\n8. Observe the time it takes for the 'Revert' operation to replace the contents of the window with the original."
