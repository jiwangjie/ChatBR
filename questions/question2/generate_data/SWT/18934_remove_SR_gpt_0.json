  "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars Should Be Disabled in ImageAnalyzer Example",
  "description": "The bug report is related to the behavior of scrollbars in the ImageAnalyzer example.",
  "OB": "In Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only), when opening the ImageAnalyzer example, it is observed that the scrollbars are enabled. Users can interact with them, but the scrollbars do not have any effect. Specifically, when viewing small images such as icons, the scrollbars are misleading because they don't provide any scrolling functionality.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that in the ImageAnalyzer example, the scrollbars should either be disabled when they are not needed, or if they are enabled, they should serve a functional purpose. The current behavior of enabled but non-functional scrollbars can be confusing for users and should be addressed.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Use Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.210 (GTK2 only).\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Notice that the scrollbars are enabled, and you can interact with them, but they do not have any effect, especially when viewing small images like icons."
