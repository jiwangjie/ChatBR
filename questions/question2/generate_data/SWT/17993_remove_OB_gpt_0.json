  "title": "Bug 17993 Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history",
  "description": "The bug report addresses an issue where the Find/Replace feature automatically replaces user-typed entries with values from the history, similar to autocomplete, making it challenging to perform find and replace operations.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is appears to involve the Find/Replace feature automatically replacing user-typed entries with values from the history. The behavior described is similar to autocomplete.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the Find/Replace feature should not automatically replace user-typed entries with values from the history. Users should be able to type their entries without automatic replacements. Case sensitivity should be maintained in user input. While users can choose values from the history if they wish, it should not be done automatically. The goal is to enable a full range of find and replace operations.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a document so that the 'Edit > Find/Replace...' menu becomes available. You should not be able to access it.\n2. When you type in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, it searches for entries from a previous search.\n3. For example, searching for 'hello' and replacing it with 'hi', then searching for 'Hello' and trying to replace it with 'Hi' is not possible.\n4. Choose 'Edit > Find/Replace...'\n5. Type 'a' into the 'Find' field and click 'Find'.\n6. Try to type 'A' into the 'Find' field."
