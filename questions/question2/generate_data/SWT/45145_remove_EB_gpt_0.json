  "EB": "The expected behavior (EB) is not explicitly mentioned in the report. It would be helpful to clarify what the user expects to happen when switching between Eclipse windows and interacting with docked views or perspectives.",
  "SR": "The steps to reproduce (SR) provide a basic scenario: using two Eclipse windows, switch from another application to one Eclipse window, and click on a docked view or perspective.
