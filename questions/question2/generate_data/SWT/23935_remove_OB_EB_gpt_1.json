  "title": "Bug 23935: Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus",
  "description": "Both widgets are children of the shell. The right tree and text only work on Windows. We can probably work around by creating the text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.",
  "OB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the tree gets focus and does not lose it.",
  "EB": "When you click anywhere in the tree, the expected behavior is that the tree should not acquire focus or should lose focus when clicking on other elements within the window.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open the application on a Windows system.\n2. Click anywhere within the tree widget."
