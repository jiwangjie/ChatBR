  "title": "Bug 14047 StyledText inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap",
  "description": "The report addresses an issue related to the inefficient redraw behavior of the StyledText component during text changes in word wrap mode.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that there is an issue with inefficient redraws during text changes.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that text changes in word wrap mode should result in efficient redraws, updating only the affected portions of the text, and not the entire client area.",
  "SR": "To investigate and address the inefficiency, the following step is suggested:\n1. Add the following line to the 'StyledText.performPaint' method to log redraw information:\n   System.out.println('lineCount ' + lineCount + ', paintY ' + paintY + ', renderHeight ' + renderHeight);\nThis will help in understanding the extent of the issue and potential areas for optimization."
