  "title": "Bug 17825 - ControlExampleText beeps when I choose SWT.MULTI",
  "description": "When using the SWT ControlExample, I noticed that it produces a beep sound when I select the SWT.MULTI option. This behavior seems unexpected and might be a bug.",
  "OB": "Upon selecting the SWT.MULTI option in the ControlExample, a beep sound is produced.",
  "EB": "I expect that selecting the SWT.MULTI option should not result in a beep sound. The application should function silently when this option is chosen.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Launch the application with Build F1 (20020521) on Win2K (unclear if this issue is specific to SWT or the SWT Example).\n2. In the SWT example, navigate to the 'ControlExample' and go to the 'Text' tab.\n3. Click on the 'Styles' button, select 'SWT.SINGLE', and then go back and choose 'SWT.MULTI'."
