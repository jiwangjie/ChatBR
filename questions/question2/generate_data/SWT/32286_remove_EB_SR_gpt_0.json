  "title": "Bug 32286 - Button Tab Styles Reset Arrow Button Orientation",
  "description": "This bug report concerns an issue in the SWT Controls example of Eclipse. When using the Button controls with SWT.ARROW buttons and selecting or deselecting the SWT.BORDER property, the arrow alignment property of all arrow buttons is reset to 'UP'. The issue was encountered in Eclipse version V2.1 (Build Id: 200302061700, M5) with M5 example plugins, running on HPUX 11.11.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that in the SWT Controls example, when applying certain styles to the Button controls, the arrow buttons initially change their orientation from pointing up to a different direction. However, when selecting or deselecting the SWT.BORDER property, the arrow buttons revert to their 'up' orientation.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that changing the SWT.BORDER property should not affect the orientation of the arrow buttons. The arrow buttons should maintain their selected alignment regardless of the state of the border property.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Install the M5 example plugins for Eclipse.\n2. Start Eclipse.\n3. Navigate to 'Window' > 'Show View' > 'Other' and select 'SWT Controls' under 'SWT Examples'. Expand the new view if necessary and click on the 'Button Tab'.\n6. On the right side of the pane, select 'SWT.ARROW' in the styles group.\nSelect an alignment other than 'up' from the alignment group.\nSelect a new orientation for the arrows.\nThen, select or deselect the 'SWT.BORDER' property again.\nNote that the arrows will return to their 'up' orientation after toggling the border property."
