  "title": "Bug 17993: Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history",
  "description": "The report suggests that the Find/Replace feature should not automatically replace user-typed entries with values from the history, similar to autocomplete.",
  "OB": "In the Find/Replace dialog, when typing in the 'Find' or 'Replace With' fields, the software searches for entries from a previous search in a case-insensitive manner. If a matching entry is found, it automatically replaces what the user has typed with the value from the history, which can make find or replace operations difficult in some cases.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the Find/Replace feature should not automatically replace user-typed entries with values from the history. Users should be able to type their entries without automatic replacements. The software should allow a full range of find and replace operations. Additionally, it should respect the case of what the user types.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, open a document so that 'Edit > Find/Replace...' becomes available. The problem should be reproducible when trying to use 'Find' or 'Replace With.'"
