  "title": "Bug 18934: Scrollbars Enabled but Ineffective in ImageAnalyzer Example",
  "description": "The report highlights an issue in the ImageAnalyzer example where scrollbars are enabled, but they have no effect, particularly when viewing small images.",
  "OB": "In Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2, the observed behavior is that the scrollbars are enabled, but they do not have any effect on the displayed images, even when interacted with. This behavior is especially noticeable when small images, like icons, are opened.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that the scrollbars are either disabled or, if enabled, they should serve a functional purpose when viewing images. In their current state, enabled but ineffective scrollbars can confuse users and should be addressed.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Use Build F2 (20020602) on Redhat 7.2 with GTK2 and KDE 2.2.\n2. Open the ImageAnalyzer example.\n3. Observe that the scrollbars are enabled and can be moved, but they don't affect the displayed images, particularly when opening small images."
