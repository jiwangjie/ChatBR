Relocate the 'Launch' cool item (the last item on the first row) to the second row, positioning it after the 'Open Type' item.\n4. Move the 'Search' cool item to the second row, inserting it after the 'Launch' cool item.\n5. Move the 'Script' cool item to the second row, specifically after the 'Search' cool item.\n6. Press the Delete button. This will result in the deletion of the first item on the second row. Observe that the second row is removed when the deletion occurs, which is not the expected behavior.
