  "title": "Bug 41347 - Unexpected CCombo Behavior on Mouse List Selection",
  "description": "The report addresses an issue where the CCombo behaves unexpectedly when a user selects an entry from the mouse-based drop-down list, triggering a defaultSelection event instead of a regular selection event.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior. When using a CCombo and opening the drop-down list with the mouse to select an entry, the CCombo incorrectly triggers a defaultSelection event. This behavior deviates from the expected behavior of a standard Combo box.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should adhere to user expectations. Instead of firing a defaultSelection event, the CCombo should generate a regular selection event when a user selects an entry from the dropdown list using the mouse. Default selection typically implies performing a specific action, and the typical response is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog. The current behavior, where defaultSelection occurs upon simply selecting an entry from the dropdown, is unexpected and should be corrected. Pressing Enter from the text field should continue to be treated as a default selection, differentiating it from mouse-based selections.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Utilize a CCombo in your application.\n2. Open the CCombo's dropdown list by clicking the drop-down arrow using the mouse.\n3. Select an entry from the list by clicking it with the mouse.\n\nExpected Result: Selecting an entry from the list using the mouse should not trigger a defaultSelection event. Instead, it should trigger a regular selection event as expected for standard Combo boxes.\n\nActual Result: The CCombo incorrectly fires a defaultSelection event when an entry is selected with the mouse, causing confusion and unexpected behavior."
