  "title": "Bug 45145: Second window comes to front when using first",
  "description": "When using two Eclipse windows and switching between them and clicking on a docked view or perspective, the second window unexpectedly comes to the front over other applications' windows.",
  "OB": "When I switch from another application to one Eclipse window and click on a docked view or perspective, the other Eclipse window comes to the front and covers my other applications' windows.",

Click on a docked view or perspective in the active Eclipse window.\n4. Observe that the other Eclipse window comes to the front over other applications' windows unexpectedly."
