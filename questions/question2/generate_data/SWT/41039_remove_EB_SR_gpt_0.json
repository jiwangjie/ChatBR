  "title": "Bug 41039 - Enter/Return Key Issue in Find/Replace Dialog on Mac OS X",
  "description": "The bug report describes a problem with the behavior of the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog on Mac OS X.",
  "OB": "In Eclipse 3.0 M2 on Mac OS X 10.2.6, the observed behavior is as follows:\n1. Open the Find/Replace dialog (Edit -> Find/Replace).\n2. Enter a search term into the text box.\n3. Press the Return key.\n\nHowever, pressing the Return key does not have any effect. The expected behavior is that pressing the Return key should trigger a 'Find' operation, which is equivalent to clicking on the 'Find' button, as it is highlighted as the default action in the Find/Replace dialog.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that in Eclipse 3.0 M2 on Mac OS X, when the Enter/Return key is pressed in the Find/Replace dialog, it should initiate a 'Find' operation, identical to the action of clicking the 'Find' button, which is marked as the default action in the Find/Replace dialog.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:\n1. Use Eclipse 3.0 M2 with Build ID: 200307181617 on Mac OS X 10.2.6.\n2. Open the Find/Replace dialog (Edit -> Find/Replace).\n3. Enter a search term into the text box.\n4. Press the Return key.\n\nExpected Result: Pressing the Return key should trigger a 'Find' operation.\n\nActual Result: Nothing happens when the Return key is pressed."
