  "OB": "The observed behavior section is currently empty. Please provide a detailed description of what occurs when the core dump issue happens.",

Select the CVS repository.\n4. Choose the option 'Use project name as module name' and click 'Finish.'\n5. Select the project in the Synchronize view.\n6. Right-click on the project and choose 'Add Version Control.'\n7. Right-click on the project and select 'Commit.'\n8. Right-click on the project and select 'Delete' (Choose 'also delete contents under the /workspace folder name').\n9. Change the perspective to the 'CVS Perspective.'\n10. Expand the repository and HEAD.\n11. Right-click on the DBCS project and select 'Check Out As Project.'\n12. [Steps beyond this point are missing in the original report.]"
