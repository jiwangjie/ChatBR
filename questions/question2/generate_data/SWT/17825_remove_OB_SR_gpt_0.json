  "description": "The bug report mentions an unexpected 'ding' sound when selecting SWT.MULTI in ControlExampleText.",
  "OB": "Upon selecting SWT.MULTI, a Windows 'ding' sound is heard, which typically indicates an error or something wrong.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that selecting SWT.MULTI should not produce a 'ding' sound, as it usually implies an incorrect action.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps: \n1. Use Build F1 (20020521) on Win2K. \n2. Open the SWT example ControlExample. \n3. Go to the Text tab. \n4. Click on Styles SWT.SINGLE and then switch back to Styles SWT.MULTI. This should trigger the unexpected 'ding' sound."
