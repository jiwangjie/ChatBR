  "description": "The issue is related to a core dump that occurs after adding a DBCS (Double-Byte Character Set) project to the workspace when changing the perspective. This bug report includes details about the environment and steps to reproduce the problem.",
  "OB": "After adding a DBCS project to the workspace, changing the perspective results in a core dump. The issue is specific to DBCS projects in Eclipse IDE, running on RedHat8 with a Japanese locale (jaJP.eucJP), using GTK 2.2 and IBM JDK1.3.1 + SR3.",
  "EB": "When adding a DBCS project to the workspace and changing the perspective, the application should not crash. It should handle DBCS projects seamlessly during perspective changes.",
