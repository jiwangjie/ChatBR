  "title": "Bug 10403 - Project Creation Should Confirm the 'bin' Directory Can Be Scrubbed",
  "description": "This bug report is related to project creation behavior when using an existing directory structure.",
  "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the observed behavior is that there is no confirmation or check to ensure that the output directory (typically named 'bin') can be safely deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and configuring the output folder to point at a 'bin' directory that may contain more than just .class files, and these additional files cannot be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and configures the output folder to point at a 'bin' directory, there should be a confirmation or check to ensure that the 'bin' directory can be safely deleted and subsequently rebuilt. This is particularly important because the 'bin' directory might contain files other than .class files, which cannot be regenerated from the available .java files.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Create a new project using an existing directory structure.\n2. During the project setup, specify the 'bin' directory as the output folder.\n3. Observe that there is no confirmation or check regarding the contents of the 'bin' directory or its ability to be safely deleted and rebuilt."
