  "title": "Confusing Message in New Package Wizard",
  "description": "The New Package Wizard displays a confusing message when creating a package with an empty name field.",
  "OB": "When invoking the New Java Package wizard, a message appears at the top before entering any text into the package name field. The message states, 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists.' This message appears even when the package name field is empty, causing confusion about its meaning. It is unclear whether this message should be considered an error, and if it is, whether it should be displayed in red with an error icon.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the package name field is empty, no message should be displayed. If a message is necessary to indicate that a package with an empty name cannot be created, it should be a clear warning message rather than an error message. Additionally, if it is a warning, it should not cause any action to be taken until the user provides a valid name.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software and navigate to the New Java Package creation wizard.\n2. Observe the message that appears at the top before entering a package name."
