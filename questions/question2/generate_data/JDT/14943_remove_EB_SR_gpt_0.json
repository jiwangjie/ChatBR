  "title": "Bug 14943 - Incorrect Line Endings Generated by Code Assist",
  "description": "This bug report addresses the issue where Code Assist generates incorrect line endings for code on a Windows machine.",
  "OB": "When using Code Assist to create a for loop with a temporary variable, the resulting code contains LF (linefeeds) instead of the expected CRLF (carriage return + linefeed) line endings on a Windows machine.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that Code Assist generates code with CRLF line endings, conforming to the standard line endings for Windows.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new class.\n2. Add a method.\n3. Define a local variable for an array.\n4. Use Code Assist to generate a for loop with a temporary variable. Observe the line endings in the generated code."
