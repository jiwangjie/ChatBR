  "title": "Bug 16938 DCR: Class File Editor scrolling issue",
  "description": "In Eclipse 20020521 (F1), it seems there's an issue with the Class File Editor's scrolling behavior. The workaround to scroll through the Class File editor is to always use the thumb, but it's not functioning as expected.",
  "OB": "When you put a breakpoint in a Java file, right before a System.out.println statement, and debug to the breakpoint, stepping into the println call (note that it may go into StringBuffer first, but that's not relevant), a Class File Editor opens. If you click on the scrollbar's down arrow, the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. Clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time also doesn't work as expected; the editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time. However, grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well.",
  "EB": "The Class File Editor in Eclipse should scroll more naturally. It should scroll one line at a time when you click on the scrollbar's arrows. Clicking on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time should also work correctly; it should scroll a page at a time instead of about a line at a time. Currently, grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that is the only method that works well.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open a Java file in Eclipse.\n2. Add a breakpoint right before a System.out.println statement.\n3. Start debugging and step into the println call.\n4. When the Class File Editor opens, click on the scrollbar's down arrow to observe the one-pixel scrolling behavior.\n5. Click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time and notice that it only scrolls about a line at a time instead of a full page."
