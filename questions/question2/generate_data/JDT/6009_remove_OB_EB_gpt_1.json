  "description": "When using the new class wizard, the context for nested classes is not correctly determined, leading to an issue with the 'Enclosing Type' field.",
  "OB": "In Build 20011106, when a .java file is open in the editor and the user clicks the new class button, the 'Enclosing Type' field is blank.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a .java file is open in the editor, and the user clicks the new class button, the 'Enclosing Type' field should default to the current type in the editor.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open Build 20011106.\n2. Open a .java file in the editor.\n3. Click the 'New Class' button.\n4. Check the 'Enclosing Type' field to see that it is blank when it should default to the current type in the editor."
