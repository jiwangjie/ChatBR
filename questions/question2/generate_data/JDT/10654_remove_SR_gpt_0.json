  "title": "Bug 10654 - Allow Adding All Jars in a Folder to Build Path",
  "description": "This bug report pertains to enhancing the build path feature for easier inclusion of multiple jar files.",
  "OB": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, users currently need to specify each jar file individually, even when multiple jar files exist in the same directory.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior, as suggested by the reporter, is to enable the use of a classpath variable that points to an entire directory. This would allow all jar files in that directory to be automatically added to the build path. This enhancement would make the process more convenient and is analogous to the 'installed extensions' feature in the Java launcher, where users can specify the system property 'java.ext.dirs' to point to a list of directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath. The reporter was inspired to request this feature after working with a class contained in the WebSphere Test Environment plugin in WSAD 4.0.",
  "SR": "To implement this feature:\n1. Open the software development environment.\n2. Access the build path settings for a project.\n3. Add a new feature that allows using a classpath variable to point to a directory containing jar files.\n4. Ensure that all jar files in the specified directory are automatically added to the build path."
