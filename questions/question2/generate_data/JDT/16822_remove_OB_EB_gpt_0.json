  "title": "Bug 16822 - Search Results Not Cleared After File Move",
  "description": "This bug report pertains to Build 200205211.",
  "OB": "After moving the file 'X.java' to the 'P/src2' directory, the search result associated with it is not removed from the search view. Attempting to double-click on the search result opens a 'Search Error' dialog with the message: 'An error occurred while creating a Java element. Reason: X.java does not exist.'",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that search results for a file should be automatically cleared from the search view when the file is moved to a different location. This should prevent any 'Search Error' dialogs when attempting to open the search results for the moved file.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a project named 'P' with two source folders: 'src1' and 'src2'.\n2. Create a compilation unit (cu) named 'X.java' under 'P/src1' with the content 'public class X {}'.\n3. Perform a search for the declaration of 'X'.\n4. Move 'X.java' to the 'P/src2' directory.\n\nObserve that the search result is not removed from the search view, and attempting to double-click on it triggers a 'Search Error' dialog with the message: 'An error occurred while creating a Java element. Reason: X.java does not exist.'"
