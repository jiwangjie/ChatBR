  "title": "Bug 7945 - Search Results Not Selected in External Jar",
  "description": "In Build 200201151, I encountered an issue where search results are not automatically selected in an external JAR when searching for references to a field.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that when double-clicking on a search result, the first match is not automatically selected in the external JAR.",
  "EB": "I expected that when double-clicking on a search result, the first match in the external JAR would be automatically selected as it should be.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Make sure you have JDK 1.3.1 as the default JRE and that you have the source for rt.jar.\n2. Open the 'java.io.File' class.\n3. Select the field 'tmpFir'.\n4. Perform a search for references to this field. Double-click on the search result to observe that the first match is not automatically selected as expected."
