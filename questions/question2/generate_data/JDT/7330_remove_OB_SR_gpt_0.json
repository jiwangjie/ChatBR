  "description": "I could not find the action 'Add Javadoc Comment' until I switched to the Outline view. Currently, we distribute the actions based on personal taste. This should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context menu and some are not. Not all actions need to be in the context menu, but they should all be reachable from the editor. It is not acceptable to force users to switch the view.",
