  "title": "Bug 10403 - Project Creation Should Confirm the bin Directory Can Be Scrubbed",
  "description": "This bug report concerns the behavior of project creation when an existing directory structure is used.",
  "OB": "When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, the observed behavior is that there is no confirmation or check that the output directory (usually 'bin') can be deleted and then rebuilt. Some users are creating projects and pointing the output folder at a 'bin' directory, which may contain more than just .class files that can be rebuilt from the available .java files.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that when a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure and points the output folder to a 'bin' directory, there should be a confirmation or check to ensure that the 'bin' directory can be safely deleted and rebuilt. This confirmation is essential, especially if the 'bin' directory contains files other than .class files that can be regenerated from the available .java files.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Create a new project using an existing directory structure.\n2. During project setup, point the output folder to a 'bin' directory that may contain non-.class files.\n3. Observe that there is no confirmation or check regarding the 'bin' directory's contents or whether it can be safely deleted and rebuilt."
