  "description": "In the Modify Parameters dialog, there are issues with duplicated name validation on the first page. Additionally, there are some layout and functionality improvements needed.",
  "OB": "The duplicated name validation behavior is not specified or implemented on the first page. There is a lack of alignment between the top button and the dialog's top. The table in the dialog lacks a label, making it difficult to associate with a mnemonic. Multiple selection is not allowed, which limits the ability to apply 'move up' and 'move down' actions to more than one item. The signature preview does not behave like a label that wraps, and it would be preferable if the background color of the signature preview matched the hover color.",
  "EB": "Duplicated name validation should be implemented on the first page of the Modify Parameters dialog. The top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog for a more cohesive layout. The table in the dialog should have a label for clarity and mnemonic association. Multiple selection functionality should be added to enable applying 'move up' and 'move down' actions to multiple items. The signature preview should wrap like a label, and its background color should match the hover color for consistency.",
  "SR": "1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog.\n2. Navigate to the first page of the dialog.\n3. Attempt to add a parameter with a duplicated name and observe the validation behavior.\n4. Check the alignment of the top button with the dialog's top.\n5. Inspect the table within the dialog and check for the presence of a label.\n6. Try to select and perform 'move up' or 'move down' actions on multiple items in the dialog.\n7. Check the behavior of the signature preview, especially when the content wraps.\n8. Observe the background color of the signature preview and check if it matches the hover color."
