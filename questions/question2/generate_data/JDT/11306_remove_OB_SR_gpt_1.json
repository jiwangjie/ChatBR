  "title": "Bug 11306 - Incorrect Wizard Launch in New Class Creation",
  "description": "The report pertains to an issue with the New Class Wizard.",
  "OB": "When launching the New Class wizard in a new workspace, it prompts the user to create a new project.",
  "EB": "When a user chooses to create a new project, the Java Class wizard should open the Java Project wizard as expected.",
  "SR": "To replicate this problem, follow these steps:\n1. In a fresh workspace, click on the 'New Class' button in the Java perspective.\n2. Observe the unexpected outcome where, upon answering 'Yes' to create a new project, the resulting dialog displays the first page of the generic new project wizard rather than the anticipated Java Project wizard."
