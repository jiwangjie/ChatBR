  "title": "Bug 17703: EditAdd Task action should use Workbench dialog as Java Editor does",
  "description": "When using the 'EditAdd Task' action in the Workbench, a different dialog appears compared to executing the same action from the Java editor's ruler context menu.",
  "OB": "When selecting a Compilation Unit (CU) in the packages view and executing the 'FileAdd Task' action, a different dialog is displayed than when you execute the action from the Java editor's ruler context menu.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'EditAdd Task' action in the Workbench should use the same dialog as when the action is executed from the Java editor's ruler context menu.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Workbench.\n2. In the 'Packages' view, select a Compilation Unit (CU).\n3. Execute the 'FileAdd Task' action.\n4. Observe that a different dialog is displayed.\n5. To compare, execute the same action from the Java editor's ruler context menu and notice the dialog that appears."
