  "title": "Bug 3666 - CodeCompletion Hungry code assist",
  "description": "Under certain circumstances, code assist eats too much code when it should give the option to replace until the end or the cursor location.",
  "OB": "In the provided code, the behavior of the code assist is incorrect. Instead of providing the option to replace until the end of the current identifier or the cursor location, it changes the code to: baz(x.foo().foo()). I would rather it gave me baz(x.foo()x.foo()).",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the code assist should provide the option to replace until the end of the current identifier or the cursor location. This choice should be conditioned by a keystroke (e.g., enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the provided code in the IDE.\n2. Place the cursor in the 'baz' method call inside the 'bar' method.\n3. Trigger the code assist feature.\n4. Observe that the code assist does not provide the expected options for replacing code until the end or cursor location."
