  "description": "Bug 5473 - ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces Build 200110251.",
  "OB": "When executing the ShiftLeft command with a combination of tabs and spaces, the text does not shift as expected. There seems to be a conflict in the behavior when intermixing tabs and spaces.",
  "EB": "Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually. When executing ShiftLeft, the text should move. In the first scenario, it seems like the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab). In any case, it's definitely confusing if there is a stray space. The user should be able to understand why the text won't shift.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. In a default text editor, type in the following:\n   <space<tab some text<tab some text\n2. Now highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.\n3. Notice that nothing moves."
