  "title": "Bug 4974 - Combined Classpath and Output Location Setting",
  "description": "This bug report addresses an issue related to the separate operations of setting the classpath and output location within the project configuration.",
  "OB": "When attempting to press 'Ok' after configuring these settings, an error message is displayed: 'Cannot nest output folder /xy in source folder /xy/src'. The problem arises from the fact that setting the output location and classpath are treated as two separate operations, leading to an illegal state.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that setting the classpath and output location should be combined into a single operation, ensuring the project's integrity and avoiding illegal states.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a project with 'src' as the source folder and 'bin' as the output location.\n2. In the project properties, change the setting to use the project as the source folder and the project as the output location (both should be set simultaneously)."
