  "title": "Changing output location doesn't delete derived resources",
  "description": "When changing the output location, the software should delete all derived resources created by the Java builder, but it currently doesn't do so.",
  "OB": "After changing the output location, the derived resources generated by the Java builder are not deleted. They remain in the old location, causing clutter and potential conflicts.",
  "EB": "After changing the output location, the software should automatically delete all derived resources that were previously generated by the Java builder in the old location. This ensures a clean and conflict-free environment for the updated build.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the software.\n2. Create a Java project with some source files.\n3. Build the project, which generates derived resources.\n4. Change the output location in the project settings to a new directory.\n5. Check the old output location to see if the derived resources have been deleted. They should not be present."
