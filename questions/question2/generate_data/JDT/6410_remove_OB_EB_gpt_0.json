  "OB": "After using code assist (CtrlSpace), the Java file is marked as 'dirtied' or 'changed' even though there are no modifications made to the file.",

  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a Java file.\n2. Place the cursor inside the leftmost parenthesis of a method call, for example, consider 'I' to be the cursor below:\n   Object o = anotherObject.method(I);\n3. Press CtrlSpace."
