  "description": "The \"Build\" action in the context-sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective is incorrectly enabled when it should not be.",
  "OB": "The \"Build\" action in the context-sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective is always enabled, even when no changes have been made to the code.",
  "EB": "The \"Build\" action in the context-sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective should only be enabled when there are code changes that require building. There is no need for a manual build if the code is already up to date.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the Java perspective in the IDE.\n2. Create a new Java project or open an existing one.\n3. Right-click in the code editor or the project explorer to open the context-sensitive popup menu.\n4. Check if the \"Build\" action is always enabled, even when there are no code changes that require building."
