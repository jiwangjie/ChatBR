  "title": "Bug 17618 - Failure to Remove Derived Resources When Changing Output Location",
  "description": "The issue concerns the failure to delete derived resources when changing the output location.",
  "OB": "When creating a project with autobuild enabled and importing Java sources and resources, changing the output folder to 'project/bin' correctly removes all class files. Similarly, changing the output folder back to the project also removes all class files. However, upon opening the 'project/bin' folder, all resources are still present, and properties dialog tags them as 'Derived'.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when changing the output location, all derived resources created by the Java builder should be removed, ensuring a clean transition.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the problem:\n1) Create a project with autobuild enabled.\n2) Import Java sources and resources.\n3) Change the output folder to 'project/bin' (all class files are removed as expected).\n4) Change the output folder back to the project (all class files are removed).\n5) Open the 'project/bin' folder and observe that all resources remain, tagged as 'Derived' in the properties dialog."
