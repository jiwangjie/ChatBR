  "OB": "The dialog for moving static members lacks mnemonics and does not perform any validation on the type field.",
  "EB": "The dialog should include mnemonics. Additionally, there should be validation on the type field to ensure it's a valid type name. The label for the type input field should be changed to 'Select destination type.'",
  "SR": "To reproduce, browse offers a type from a CU in a different project."
