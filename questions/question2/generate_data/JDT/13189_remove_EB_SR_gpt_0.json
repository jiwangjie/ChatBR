  "title": "Context Menu Overridden by Deletion Confirmation Dialog",
  "description": "The context menu for refactoring and deleting fields is overridden by a message dialog, which doesn't allow proper interaction.",
  "OB": "Upon attempting to access the context menu for refactoring and deleting fields, no context menu is displayed. Instead, a deletion confirmation dialog immediately appears, prompting whether the getter/setter should also be deleted.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is for the context menu to function correctly, allowing users to initiate field refactoring and deletion without immediate confirmation dialogs.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Configure JUnit2.\n2. Enable the option 'Code Generator: Remove prefix from field names'.\n3. Open the 'TestCase.java' file.\n4. In the outliner, right-click on 'fName'."
