  "description": "The New Package Wizard displays a confusing message when creating a package with an empty name field.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is not described in the report. Please provide details about what you see happening when encountering this issue.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be as follows: When invoking the New Java Package wizard and before entering any text into the package name field, no message should appear at the top. If a message is necessary to indicate that a package with an empty name cannot be created, it should be a clear warning message rather than an error message. The 'Finish' button should also be disabled until a valid name is provided.",
  "SR": "To better understand and address the problem, please provide clear and detailed steps to reproduce the issue, including the actions taken and what should happen when following these steps."
