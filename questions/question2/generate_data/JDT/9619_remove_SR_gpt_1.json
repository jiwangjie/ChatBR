  "title": "Bug 9619 - Move static member: Dialog details",
  "description": "When attempting to move a static member, there are a few issues to address:\n\na. Mnemonics should be added for better accessibility.\n\nb. No validation is performed on the 'type' field. Type existence check should be added. This check is not too expensive and could be performed. The type wizard for the superclass already does it.\n\nc. The 'Browse' button is too small. It should be resized to match SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\n\nd. The title is used for long text, and when going to the next page, it incorrectly states 'Type not found.' Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in the dialog.\n\ne. The destination type can be the same as the source type, and the refactoring incorrectly warns that this will result in errors, which is not true. Additionally, it makes pseudo-changes in all referencing classes.",
  "OB": "The observed issues in the current behavior are:\n\n1. The 'Browse' button is too small.\n2. The title is used for long text, resulting in an incorrect message when moving to the next page ('Type not found').\n3. The destination type can be the same as the source type, leading to incorrect error warnings and pseudo-changes in referencing classes.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should include the following improvements:\n\n1. Add mnemonics for better accessibility.\n2. Implement validation for the 'type' field to check for type existence.\n3. Resize the 'Browse' button to match SWTUtil for standard button sizes.\n4. Ensure that the title is appropriately used for 'Move static field(s)' and the description for 'x fields from xx'.\n5. Initialize the selection dialog with the type currently entered.",
  "SR": "To reproduce these issues:\n\n1. Open the 'Move static member' dialog.\n2. Observe the small size of the 'Browse' button.\n3. Input a type in the 'type' field that does not exist and proceed to the next page to see the 'Type not found' message.\n4. Attempt to move a static member to a destination type that is the same as the source type, and notice the error warnings and pseudo-changes in referencing classes."
