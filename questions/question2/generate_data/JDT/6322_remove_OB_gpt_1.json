  "EB": "These obfuscated classes should have reduced visibility in the dialog.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Launch the JDK 1.4 software.\n2. Open the 'All Types' dialog.\n3. Observe that obfuscated classes are displayed.\n\nTo fix this issue, the following options can be considered:\na) Sort lower case class names after the ones that start with a capital letter.\nb) Filter out obfuscated classes completely. I suggest implementing option a)."
