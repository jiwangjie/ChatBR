  "description": "The New Package Wizard displays a confusing message when creating a package with an empty name field.",
  "OB": "When I invoke the New Java Package wizard, before entering any text into the package name field, a message appears at the top that says, 'A folder corresponding to the package name already exists.' I'm puzzled by this message because my package name field is empty. I'm not sure if this is an error or a warning, and I'm unsure if it should be displayed in red with an error icon. EG (5/1/2001 5:53:41 AM) mentioned that there should be no error message when the package name field is empty, and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. MA (5/2/01 9:34:00 AM) stated that it is a warning and will remove the message. EG (5/2/01 9:43:44 AM) raised the issue of how to create a default package, as it can't be created by the user since it always exists.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when the package name field is empty, no message should appear, and the 'Finish' button should be disabled. If a message is necessary to indicate that a package with an empty name cannot be created, it should be a clear warning message rather than an error message.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new Java Project.\n2. Select the newly created project.\n3. Invoke the New Package Wizard."
