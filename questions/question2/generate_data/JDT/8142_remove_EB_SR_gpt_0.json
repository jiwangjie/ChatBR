  "title": "Bug 8142 - No Scoped Type Hierarchy on Binary Projects",
  "description": "The description of Bug 8142 is not clear and is difficult to understand.",
  "OB": "When I attempt to view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), I receive the following message: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I expected to see the class hierarchies of the internal JARs. I don't understand the meaning of this message.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when I view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant), it should display the class hierarchies of the internal JARs. Additionally, the message provided should be clear and provide meaningful information.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a binary project (e.g., org.apache.ant).\n2. Attempt to view the scoped type hierarchy.\n3. Observe the message and behavior. The issue is that it should display class hierarchies of the internal JARs and provide a more informative message."
