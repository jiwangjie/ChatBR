  "description": "When changing the output location of a project, it should delete all derived resources, but currently, this is not happening as expected.",
  "OB": "When creating a project with autobuild enabled, importing Java sources and resources, and changing the output folder to 'project/bin', all class files are removed as expected. However, when changing the output folder back to the project, all class files are also removed, which is fine. The issue is that when you open 'project/bin', all resources are still there. Note: When opening the properties dialog on such a resource, it is tagged as 'Derived.'",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when changing the output folder, all derived resources within the previous output folder should be deleted. In this case, when changing the output folder back to 'project', all class files should be deleted, and there should be no remaining resources in 'project/bin.'",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a project with autobuild enabled.\n2. Import Java sources and resources into the project.\n3. Change the output folder to 'project/bin'.\n4. Observe that all class files are removed (as expected).\n5. Change the output folder back to 'project'.\n6. Observe that all class files are removed (as expected).\n7. Open 'project/bin' and observe that all resources are still there (this is the issue)."
