  "title": "Bug 18285: Double-clicking on import statement transfers to referenced type",
  "description": "The current behavior is causing confusion for users, as double-clicking on an import statement in the package view outline opens the editor on the target type, instead of the unit hosting the import reference.",
  "OB": "When using Build 20020528, in the package view outline, double-clicking on a type import statement redirects to the editor of the referenced type, not the unit containing the import reference.",
  "EB": "When using Build 20020528, in the package view outline, double-clicking on a type import statement should open the editor of the unit hosting the import reference, not the editor of the referenced type.",
  "SR": "To reproduce:\n1. Open the software using Build 20020528.\n2. Navigate to the package view outline.\n3. Double-click on a type import statement.\n4. Observe that the editor opens on the referenced type, instead of the unit hosting the import reference."
