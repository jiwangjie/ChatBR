  "description": "I don't understand it.",
  "OB": "The bug report lacks a clear description of the observed behavior.",
  "EB": "When attempting to view the scoped type hierarchy of a binary project (e.g., 'org.apache.ant'), I get the following error: 'No declaration of selected members in the chosen hierarchy of 'org.apache.ant'. I would expect to see the class hierarchies of the internal jars. I'm also unsure about the meaning of this error message.",
  "SR": "1. Open the software application.\n2. Navigate to a binary project, for example, 'org.apache.ant'.\n3. Attempt to view the scoped type hierarchy within the project."
