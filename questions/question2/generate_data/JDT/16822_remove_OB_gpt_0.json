  "title": "Bug 16822 - Search results not removed when cu is moved",
  "description": "Build 200205211.",
  "OB": "After moving the file X.java from 'P/src1' to 'P/src2', the search result for the declaration of X.java remains in the search view. Attempting to double-click on the search result opens a 'Search Error' dialog with the following message: 'An error occurred while creating a Java element. Reason: X.java does not exist.'",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a Java source file (e.g., X.java) is moved from one source folder (e.g., 'P/src1') to another (e.g., 'P/src2'), the search result for the declaration of the moved file should be automatically removed from the search view. There should be no 'Search Error' dialog related to the moved file.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Create a project 'P' with 2 source folders: 'src1' and 'src2'.\n2. Create a Java source file 'X.java' under 'P/src1'.\n3. Perform a search for the declaration of 'X'.\n4. Move 'X.java' from 'P/src1' to 'P/src2'.\n\nObservation:\nThe search result for 'X.java' is still present in the search view.\nAttempting to double-click on the search result opens a 'Search Error' dialog with the message: 'An error occurred while creating a Java element. Reason: X.java does not exist.'"
