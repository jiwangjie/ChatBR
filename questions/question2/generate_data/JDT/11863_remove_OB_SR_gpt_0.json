  "title": "Bug 11863: Update Test Suite action behavior and naming issue",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "The 'Update Test Suite' action does not match its expected behavior. It should typically display the contents of existing items (directories, zip files) and allow for modifications, but it does not.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'Update Test Suite' action should show the existing content and allow for modifications, as its name suggests. Additionally, there is a suggestion to resolve this issue by renaming the action and the dialog to 'Recreate Test Suite' to better reflect its actual behavior.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Attempt to use the 'Update Test Suite' action.\n2. Observe that the action does not behave as expected, and it does not display the existing content for modification, contrary to what the name implies."
