  "title": "Bug 13269 - Incorrect operation order in jarpackager",
  "description": "The jarpackager is not functioning correctly. The same issue applies to the '.jardesc' file as well. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. This issue was observed on 20020409. JRT.",
  "OB": "When attempting to create a JAR file using the jarpackager, if you choose not to overwrite an existing '.jardesc' or manifest file, the wizard incorrectly reports a failure. The 'JAR creation failed' error occurs even though the '.jardesc' file and manifest file were not supposed to be overwritten in the first place.",
  "EB": "Regardless of whether you choose to overwrite existing files or not, the jarpackager should complete its operation without reporting a failure. The 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not attempt to save a new manifest file.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Select some packages and export a JAR file.\n2. Select 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3. Click 'Next'.\n4. In the 'Save description of this JAR in the workspace' section, choose a '.jardesc' file that already exists.\n5. Click 'Next'.\n6. Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest file that already exists (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n7. Click 'Finish'.\n8. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your '.jardesc' file. Choose 'NO'.\n9. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\n10. Note that an error dialog appears, saying 'JAR creation failed' because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. If you click 'OK', you will return to the wizard.\n11. Choose 'Cancel'.\n12. Go to where your '.jar' file was supposed to have been generated and note that it was indeed created."
