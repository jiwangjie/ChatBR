  "description": "This bug report addresses the ShiftLeft behavior when tabs and spaces are intermixed in the text.",
  "OB": "The specific observed behavior is not described in the report.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is not explicitly stated in the report, leaving it unclear what the desired outcome should be. However, based on the description, the expected behavior is that when the tab character in the first line is replaced with spaces so that the two lines are indented the same visually, executing ShiftLeft should cause the text to move. The report suggests that in the first scenario, the second line should be shifted left, and the first line should be shifted left at least to the space character, effectively removing the tab character. The report also indicates that having a stray space can be confusing and may prevent the text from shifting as expected.",
  "SR": "The report does not provide specific steps to reproduce the issue."
