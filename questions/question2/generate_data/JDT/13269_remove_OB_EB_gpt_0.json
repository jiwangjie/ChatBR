  "title": "Order of Operations Issue in Jar Packaging",
  "description": "There is a problem related to the order of operations in the jar packager, and this issue also affects '.jardesc' files. It is suggested that a warning in the wizard's header, now that an icon is shown, would be more appropriate than a dialog box at the end. Users who want to proceed with overwriting should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option.",
  "OB": "The issue arises because the jar file is created before the overwrite verifications take place. It's important to note that the messages like 'saving manifest file failed' may be misleading in this case, as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file.",
  "EB": "",
  "SR": "To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:\n1. Select some packages and export a JAR.\n2. Choose 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3. Click 'Next'.\n4. Select 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' for a .jardesc that already exists.\n5. Click 'Next'.\n6. Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest that already exists. You can do this by running the wizard once and then running it a second time with the preserved settings.\n7. Click 'Finish'.\n8. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n9. Another dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\n10. Note that an error dialog appears, indicating that JAR creation failed because saving the manifest to the workspace and saving the description to the workspace failed. Click 'OK' to return to the wizard. Finally, choose 'Cancel' and check if the .jar file was indeed created."
