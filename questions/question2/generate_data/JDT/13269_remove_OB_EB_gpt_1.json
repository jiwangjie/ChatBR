  "title": "Bug 13269: Incorrect Operation Order in Jarpackager",
  "description": "When using the Jarpackager, a similar issue occurs with the '.jardesc' file. Perhaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file than a dialog box at the end. If the user wants that, they should use the 'Save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'Reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. This issue was observed in version 20020409. JRT.",
  "OB": "When following the provided steps to export a JAR file, an error occurs when attempting to overwrite the .jardesc and manifest files. An error dialog appears, stating that JAR creation failed due to a failure in saving the manifest to the workspace and saving the description to the workspace. If the user clicks 'OK,' they are returned to the wizard.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that when the user chooses not to overwrite the .jardesc and manifest files, the JAR creation process should still succeed, and no error dialog should appear. The user should be able to complete the JAR creation process without encountering errors.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Select some packages and choose to export a JAR.\n2. Select 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3. Click 'Next'.\n4. In the 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' section, select a .jardesc file that already exists.\n5. Click 'Next'.\n6. Select 'Use existing manifest from the workspace' and choose a manifest that already exists (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n7. Click 'Finish'.\n8. A dialog will appear, asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. Choose 'NO'.\n9. A dialog will appear, asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\n10. Note that an error dialog appears, saying JAR creation failed because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. Click 'OK,' and you will return to the wizard.\n11. Choose 'Cancel'.\n12. Go to where your .jar file was supposed to have been generated and note that it was indeed created."
