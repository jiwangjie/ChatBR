  "title": "Inconsistent Behavior when Manipulating Source in Browsing Perspective",
  "description": "Users have reported an inconsistency in the behavior when manipulating source in the type hierarchy and the method list of the browser perspective.",
  "OB": "From the user's perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference when manipulating source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browser perspective. This difference includes issues like changes made to the method list view and type hierarchy not reflecting properly, and the editor becoming dirty when manipulating from the method list view.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that both manipulations should behave consistently. Regardless of the view, if there is an open editor, all manipulations should work on the working copy shown in the editor.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the Java Browsing Perspective.\n2. Select a type.\n3. Select a method in the method list view.\n4. Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view (the editor becomes dirty).\n5. Select another type.\n6. Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7. Select a method in the method list view.\n8. Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9. Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view (method is deleted on the file system, type list view, method list view, editor are all cleared). "
