  "title": "Context Menu Overridden by Message Dialog When Deleting Fields",
  "description": "Users have reported that the context menu is overridden by a message dialog when trying to delete fields during refactoring.",
  "OB": "When users attempt to delete fields, they do not see the expected context menu. Instead, a message dialog appears immediately, asking if they want to delete the getter/setter as well.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the context menu should be displayed without interruption when deleting fields. Users should be able to initiate field deletion without encountering immediate message dialogs.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set up JUnit2.\n2. Enable the option 'Code Generator: Remove prefix from field names'.\n3. Open the 'TestCase.java' file.\n4. In the outliner, right-click on 'fName'."
