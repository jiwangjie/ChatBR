  "description": "This bug report addresses issues with the 'Modify Parameters' dialog, suggesting multiple improvements to enhance its functionality and usability.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior includes several issues: the buttons are too small, when opening the dialog, no table entry is selected, both move buttons are enabled, and when changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off. Additionally, the dialog appears overly large for methods with many parameters.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior includes the following improvements: reducing the excessive spacing between the button and the list, aligning the top button with the dialog's top, adding a label to the table to support mnemonics, enabling multiple item selection for moving up or down, ensuring the signature preview label wraps properly, and setting the background color of the signature preview to match the hover color.",
  "SR": "The report lacks specific steps to reproduce the issues, making it challenging to reproduce or verify the problems based on the information given."
