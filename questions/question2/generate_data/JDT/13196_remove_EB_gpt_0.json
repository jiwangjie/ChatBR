  "title": "Unexpected Behavior when Manipulating Source in Browsing Perspective",
  "description": "Users have reported an unexpected behavioral difference when manipulating source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browser perspective.",
  "OB": "From the user's perspective, when performing the following actions:\n1. Open Java Browsing Perspective.\n2. Select a type.\n3. Select a method in the method list view.\n4. Delete the method using the context menu in the method list view.\n   - The editor becomes dirty as expected.\n5. Select another type.\n6. Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7. Select a method in the method list view of the hierarchy.\n8. Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9. Delete the method using the context menu in the hierarchy view.\n   - The method is deleted on the file system.\n   - The type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared.\n\nNote: This issue occurs only when the editor is not dirty.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that whether the editor is dirty or not, performing the above actions should lead to consistent results. Users should experience the same behavior when manipulating source in the type hierarchy and the method list of the browser perspective.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Java Browsing Perspective.\n2. Select a type.\n3. Select a method in the method list view.\n4. Delete the method using the context menu in the method list view.\n5. Select another type.\n6. Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view.\n7. Select a method in the method list view of the hierarchy.\n8. Select the same method in the hierarchy view.\n9. Delete the method using the context menu in the hierarchy view."
