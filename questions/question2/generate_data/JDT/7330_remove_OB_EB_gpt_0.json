  "title": "Bug 7330 - Improve Accessibility of Actions on Text Selection",
  "description": "Certain actions, such as 'Add Javadoc Comment,' are not readily available in the context menu, leading to confusion and the need to switch to the Outline view to access them. There's a need to review the distribution of actions to enhance user experience.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the bug report. It should detail the current behavior when selecting text.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that all relevant actions should be easily accessible from the context menu or another global menu. Users should not be required to switch views to access commonly used actions. The distribution of actions should be logical and user-friendly.",
  "SR": "To address this issue, please make sure that actions like 'Add Javadoc Comment' are added to the context menu or a global menu, making them accessible without the need to switch views. Provide steps to reproduce the problem to facilitate the resolution."
