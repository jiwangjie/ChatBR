  "title": "Bug 13196 - Unexpected Behavioral Difference in Browsing Perspective",
  "description": "This bug report highlights an unexpected behavioral difference when manipulating the source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browser perspective.",
  "OB": "When performing the following steps in the Java Browsing Perspective: 1) Open Java Browsing Perspective, 2) Select a type, 3) Select a method in the method list view, 4) Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view (editor becomes dirty), 5) Select another type, 6) Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view, 7) Select a method in the method list view, 8) Select the same method in the hierarchy view, 9) Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view; the method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared. However, it's important to note that this behavior does not occur when the editor is dirty.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when performing the aforementioned steps, the method should be deleted from the hierarchy view without affecting the file system, type list view, method list view, and editor. The editor should remain in its previous state without becoming dirty.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps: 1. Open the Java Browsing Perspective. 2. Select a type in the perspective. 3. Choose a method in the method list view. 4. Delete the method using the context menu of the method list view. 5. Select another type. 6. Open the type hierarchy on this type and dock the hierarchy view. 7. In the hierarchy view, select a method from the method list. 8. Choose the same method in the hierarchy view. 9. Delete the method using the context menu of the hierarchy view. Observe that the method is deleted on the file system, and the type list view, method list view, and editor are all cleared. Make sure the editor is not in a dirty state during these steps to confirm the issue."
