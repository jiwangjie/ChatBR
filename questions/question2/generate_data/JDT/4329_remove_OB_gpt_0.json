  "title": "Bug 4329 - Search for Declarations Issue in Package View",
  "description": "This bug report is related to searching for declarations when using the Package view selection and dialog.",
  "OB": "When searching for declarations via the Package view selection and dialog, no results are returned. However, using the context menu in the packages view for the same search works correctly.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when searching for declarations in the Java context, the software should first attempt to locate the Java element. If this attempt fails, it should display the element name in the search results instead of the fully qualified name.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the Package view.\n2. Use the search dialog to search for declarations.\n3. Observe that no search results are returned.\n4. Alternatively, use the context menu in the packages view for the same search, which should return the expected results."
