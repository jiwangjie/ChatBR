  "title": "Bug 13269 - Incorrect operation order in jarpackager",
  "description": "The jarpackager is experiencing an issue, which is also present in the '.jardesc' file. It might be more user-friendly to display a warning in the wizard's header, especially for the '.jardesc' file, instead of showing a dialog box at the end. If the user intends to proceed, they should use the 'save the manifest in the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the workspace' option. This issue dates back to 20020409. JRT.",
  "OB": "The problem occurs because the jar file is created before the overwrite verifications take place. Additionally, it's worth noting that the message 'saving manifest file failed' may be misleading in this case because the user opted not to overwrite the manifest file, which isn't a failure.",
  "EB": "Expected behavior is that the jarpackager should perform overwrite verifications before creating the jar file. The messages should be more accurate and informative, particularly when users choose not to overwrite existing files during the packaging process.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Select some packages and export a jar.\n2. Choose 'Export java source files and resources'.\n3. Click 'Next'.\n4. Select a '.jardesc' file to save in the workspace that already exists.\n5. Click 'Next'.\n6. Select 'Use an existing manifest from the workspace' and choose a manifest that already exists (this is easier if you run the wizard once and then a second time with the preserved settings).\n7. Click 'Finish'.\n8. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your '.jardesc' file. Choose 'NO'.\n9. A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. Choose 'NO'.\n10. An error dialog appears, indicating that JAR creation failed because saving the manifest to the workspace failed and saving the description to the workspace failed. If you click 'OK,' you will return to the wizard.\n11. Choose 'Cancel'.\n12. Go to where your '.jar' file was supposed to be generated and note that it was indeed created."
