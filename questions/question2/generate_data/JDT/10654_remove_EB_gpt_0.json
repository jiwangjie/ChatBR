  "title": "Bug 10654 - Allow Adding All Jars in a Folder to Build Path",
  "description": "This bug report addresses an issue related to adding multiple jar files to the build path using classpath variables.",
  "OB": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same directory.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, there should be an option to add all jar files within a specified directory to the build path at once.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Use the software to manage a Java project.\n2. Navigate to the build path settings.\n3. Attempt to add jar files located in the same directory using classpath variables.\n4. Notice that you have to specify each jar file individually.\n5. Manually add multiple jar files from a directory, like the WTE plugin directory, to the build path, which requires searching for missing classes and adding appropriate jars."
