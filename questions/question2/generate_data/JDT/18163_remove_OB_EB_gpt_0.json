  "title": "Bug 18163: Add Import should ignore leading/trailing whitespace",
  "description": "When using the 'Add Import' feature, it fails to work when there is leading or trailing whitespace within the selected text. This behavior should be improved to ignore such whitespace.",
  "OB": "The 'Add Import' feature does not work when there is leading or trailing whitespace within the selected text.",
  "EB": "The 'Add Import' feature should work seamlessly regardless of the presence of leading or trailing whitespace within the selected text.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open a code editor.\n2. Select a piece of text that includes leading or trailing whitespace.\n3. Press Ctrl+M to use the 'Add Import' feature.\n4. Observe that the feature does not work as expected due to the whitespace in the selection."
