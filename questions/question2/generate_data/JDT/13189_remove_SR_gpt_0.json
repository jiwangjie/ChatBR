  "title": "Context Menu Overridden by Message Dialog When Deleting Fields",
  "description": "Users have reported that the context menu is overridden by a message dialog when trying to delete fields during refactoring.",
  "OB": "When attempting to delete fields during refactoring, the expected context menu is not displayed. Instead, a message dialog immediately appears, inquiring whether to delete the getter/setter as well.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the context menu for deleting fields should be displayed without interruption. Users should be able to initiate field deletion without encountering an immediate message dialog.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Set up JUnit2.\n2. Enable the option 'Code Generator: Remove prefix from field names'.\n3. Open the 'TestCase.java' file.\n4. In the outliner, right-click on 'fName'."
