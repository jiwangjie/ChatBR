  "description": "In Bug 9654 - Modify Parameters, there are several issues with the dialog details. The duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page, and the first and second columns could be merged.",
  "OB": "a. The buttons in the dialog are too small.\n\nb. When the dialog comes up, no table entry is selected. However, both move buttons are enabled.\n\nc. When changing a parameter name to something very long, the preview is cut off.\n\nd. The dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters.",
  "EB": "a. Increase the spacing between the button and the list; the top button should be aligned with the top of the dialog.\n\nb. Add a label to the table so it can contain a mnemonic.\n\nc. Allow multiple selections in the table, as the 'Move Up' and 'Move Down' actions should be applicable to more than one item.\n\nd. Ensure that the signature preview appears as a label that wraps text.\n\ne. Set the background color of the signature preview to match the hover color.\n\nf. Implement duplicated name validation on the first page of the dialog.\n\ng. Merge the first and second columns in the dialog for a more efficient layout.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issues:\n1. Open the Modify Parameters dialog.\n2. Observe the small buttons and the lack of selected table entry.\n3. Try changing a parameter name to something very long and notice the cut-off preview.\n4. Open the dialog for a method with many parameters, and see that it appears overly large.\n5. Attempt to perform the expected behaviors:\n   - Increase spacing between the button and the list.\n   - Add a label to the table.\n   - Allow multiple selections in the table and test 'Move Up' and 'Move Down' actions.\n   - Ensure the signature preview appears as a label with text wrapping.\n   - Set the background color of the signature preview to match the hover color.\n6. Also, test the duplicated name validation on the first page and the merging of the first and second columns."
