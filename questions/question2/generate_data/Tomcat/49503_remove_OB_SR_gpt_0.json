  "title": "Connectors Fail to Bind Ports During Catalina.load()",
  "description": "This bug report indicates an issue where Connectors in Tomcat do not bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() phase but succeed later during the start() phase.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is not provided in the report.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior would be that in StandardService.initInternal(), the connector.init() call should fail because it cannot bind to the port. The exception from connector.init() should be caught, and if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, it should be rethrown, then caught in Catalina.load(), and finally rethrown as an Error, which would abort Tomcat startup.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Add the following line to 'conf/catalina.properties': 'org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true'\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."
