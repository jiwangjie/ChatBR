  "title": "Bug 50016 - Bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods",
  "description": "There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong. In the current tomcat implementation, roleref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a roleref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role.",
  "OB": "The current implementation reports true for both A and B.",
  "EB": "So to be reasonably amenable to a jacc implementation, Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and, if possible, the servlet name to the wrapper. If there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. A user that logs in and is in role A and not B should be able to test if they are in A (false) and in B (true). Both isUserInRole and login/logout methods should be delegated directly to the Authenticator, which should also have the ability to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results.",
  "SR": "Consider a web app with two roles, A and B, and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A."
