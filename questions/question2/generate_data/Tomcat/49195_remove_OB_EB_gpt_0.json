  "OB": "The bug report lacks a clear description of the observed behavior. It does not specify what exactly happens when using port 1 as the shutdown port with the Tomcat Windows service.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the bug report. However, it can be inferred that when using port 1 as the shutdown port, the software should not print an error message related to 'No shutdown port configured.' The shutdown process should work correctly without errors.",
