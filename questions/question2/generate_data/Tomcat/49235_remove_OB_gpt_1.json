  "title": "Bug 49235: ServletContainerInitializer onStartup(Set<Class<? classSet produces unexpected output",
  "description": "When using ServletContainerInitializer's onStartup method with a set of classes, the output is not as expected.",
  "OB": "The output is \"MySomeClass\".",
  "EB": "The expected output should be the class name of the set elements, such as \"MySomeAnn\".",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Build Tomcat 7.0.0 from svn r939221.\n2. Use the following code:\n\n@MySomeAnn\npublic class MySomeClass {...}\n\n@HandlesTypes(MySomeAnn.class)\npublic class ModuleInitializer implements ServletContainerInitializer {\n  @Override\n  public void onStartup(Set<Class<?>> classSet, ServletContext ctx) throws ServletException {\n    for (Class<?> targetClass : classSet) {\n      System.out.println(targetClass.getName());\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n3. Execute the code and observe the output, which is currently \"MySomeClass\" instead of the expected \"MySomeAnn\"."
