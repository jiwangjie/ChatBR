  "description": "The bug report highlights an issue where accessing a URL in a Tomcat 7 instance with no webapps deployed results in an unexpected HTTP status code of 200 OK with no content, instead of the anticipated HTTP error 404.",
  "OB": "The actual behavior, when attempting to access a URL in a Tomcat 7 instance without any deployed webapps, is not provided in the report. Therefore, the observed behavior is unclear.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior in this scenario should be that when accessing a URL in a Tomcat 7 instance without any webapps deployed, it should return an HTTP error 404 to indicate that the requested resource is not found.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:\n1. Download the Tomcat 7 instance from 'http://mirror.veriportal.com/apache/tomcat/tomcat7/v7.0.0beta/bin/apachetomcat7.0.0.zip'.\n2. Start a Tomcat 7 instance with no webapps deployed.\n3. Attempt to access a URL in this instance and observe the HTTP response code.
