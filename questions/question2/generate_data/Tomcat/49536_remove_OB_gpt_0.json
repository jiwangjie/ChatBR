  "OB": "When attempting to access a URL in a Tomcat 7 instance lacking deployed webapps, the actual behavior is not described in the report.",

  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Download the Tomcat 7 instance from 'http://mirror.veriportal.com/apache/tomcat/tomcat7/v7.0.0beta/bin/apachetomcat7.0.0.zip'.\n2. Start a Tomcat 7 instance with no webapps deployed.\n3. Access a URL in this instance, and observe that it returns an HTTP code of 200 OK with no content instead of the expected HTTP error 404."
