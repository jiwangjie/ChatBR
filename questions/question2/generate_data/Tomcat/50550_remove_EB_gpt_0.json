  "title": "Bug 50550 - PropFind 404 Error After MkCol Success",
  "description": "This bug report concerns a situation where a PropFind call on a resource results in a 404 error when executed after an MkCol (make collection) operation on the same resource. It may be related to caching issues. Reproduction of this issue is possible using a Jackrabbit client.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that a PropFind call on a resource returns a 404 error when executed after an MkCol for the same resource.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that a PropFind call should successfully retrieve the properties of a resource even after an MkCol operation on that resource.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Use a Jackrabbit client (e.g., HttpClient). 2. Execute a PropFind call on a specific resource. 3. Execute an MkCol operation on the same resource. 4. Execute a PropFind call again on the same resource. Expected result: The PropFind call should not result in a 404 error after the MkCol operation."
