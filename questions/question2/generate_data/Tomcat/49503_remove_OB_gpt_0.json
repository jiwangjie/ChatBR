  "title": "Bug 49503 - Connectors Delayed Port Binding in Catalina.load()",
  "description": "The bug report discusses an issue where Connectors in Tomcat do not bind to their ports during the Catalina.load() phase but only later during the start() phase.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the report.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when attempting to bind to their ports in StandardService.initInternal(), the connector.init() call should fail, resulting in an exception. This exception should be caught and, if the EXITONINITFAILURE flag is set, rethrown. It should then be caught in Catalina.load() and rethrown as an Error, which would terminate Tomcat's startup process.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:\n1. Add the following line to 'conf/catalina.properties': 'org.apache.catalina.startup.EXITONINITFAILURE=true'\n2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time."
