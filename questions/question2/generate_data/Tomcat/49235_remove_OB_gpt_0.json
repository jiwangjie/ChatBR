  "description": "This bug report addresses an issue with ServletContainerInitializer onStartup resulting in unexpected output.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is not explicitly provided in the bug report.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the 'classSet' should contain 'MySomeClass' instances, but the report mentions 'classSet is not expect class.'",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Build Tomcat 7.0.0 from svn r939221.\n2. Use the provided code, including the @MySomeAnn class and the ModuleInitializer class.\n3. In the ModuleInitializer's onStartup method, call System.out.println(targetClass.getName()) for each class in 'classSet.'\n4. Observe that the output is 'MySomeAnn' instead of the expected 'MySomeClass.'"
