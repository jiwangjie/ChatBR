  "title": "Bug 50550 - PropFind 404 Error after MkCol Success",
  "description": "The bug report suggests that a 404 error is occurring after a successful MkCol operation, indicating a potential caching issue. The issue is similar to a previously fixed problem (call 21288) related to 'DirContext caching with Dreamweaver 6 when recursively creating directories.' The problem can be replicated using a Jackrabbit client with the provided code.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that a 404 error occurs when making a PropFind call on a resource following a successful MkCol operation on the same resource.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the MkCol operation should be preceded by a PropFind request to trigger the issue. This means that when making a PropFind call before MkCol, it should not result in a 404 error.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue: 1. Utilize a Jackrabbit client (e.g., HttpClient). 2. Execute a PropFind call on a specific resource. 3. Perform an MkCol operation on the same resource. 4. Execute another PropFind call on the same resource. The issue should be replicated when the PropFind is executed before MkCol. Access logs indicate that when the first request is omitted, the third request is successful, as shown in the provided logs. Additionally, it's noted that the response to PropFind becomes 'OK' after a few seconds."
