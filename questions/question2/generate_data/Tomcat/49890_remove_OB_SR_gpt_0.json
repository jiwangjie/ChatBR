  "title": "Nio Selector Issue Causing High CPU Usage on Linux Platform",
  "description": "This bug report discusses an issue related to the Nio Selector on the Linux platform. The problem is characterized by the server's CPU usage spiking to 100%, and it remains at 100% until the server is restarted. The issue has been replicated with different Java versions, including 1.6.007, 1.6.018, and 1.6.021. The reporter suggests that this problem may be a duplicate of Bug 46373, and they mention a potential solution provided by the Jetty team at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:commenttabpanel. To assist in diagnosing the problem, the reporter has made modifications to the NioEndpoint.java file, adding additional logging.",
  "OB": "The bug report does not provide specific details about the observed behavior caused by the Nio Selector issue on the Linux platform. It mentions high CPU usage, but the exact consequences or errors are not mentioned.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that the server's CPU usage remains at a reasonable level, allowing the server to operate efficiently without consuming excessive CPU resources.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this potential JVM bug, you should make multiple requests to a web application, which can be done by repeatedly pressing the F5 key in a web browser and holding it down. It's important to note that this problem appears to be specific to the Linux platform and is not observed on Windows. The attachments 'NioEndpoint.7z' and 'web.7z' include a patched NioEndpoint.java file with added logging and a simple web application for testing purposes."
