    "description": "When attempting to instantiate FontRegistry using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource, the FontRegistry class restricts resource lookup to only those relative to the location of the class org.eclipse.jface.resource. To resolve this issue, the FontRegistry constructor should be modified to accept a client class or class loader as an additional parameter.",
