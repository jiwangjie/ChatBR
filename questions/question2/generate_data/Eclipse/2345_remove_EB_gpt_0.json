  "OB": "When following the steps in 1GEWMOZ, where ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example opens on XML files by default, and creating a new basic project with a file named test.xml, the editor used is the scripted resource editor example. However, it completely ignores the XML file's content. When I select test.xml in the Navigator and choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor,' nothing happens. Instead, it reactivates the scripted resource editor example. It should open a new editor on the file because the editor type is different.",
  "EB": "When selecting 'Open With... / Default Text Editor' for a file with a different editor type, it should open a new editor on the file with the default text editor, displaying the file's content.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Navigate to a scenario as described in 1GEWMOZ where the ITPUI:WIN2000Scripted resource editor example opens XML files by default.\n2. Create a new basic project.\n3. Create a new file named 'test.xml' within the project.\n4. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml.'\n5. Choose 'Open With... / Default Text Editor.'\n6. Observe that nothing happens, and the scripted resource editor example remains active, rather than opening the file with the default text editor, as expected."
