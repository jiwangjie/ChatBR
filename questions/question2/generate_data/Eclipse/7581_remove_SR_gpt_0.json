  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...",
  "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not resize correctly in the property sheet.",
  "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the width of the property sheet column. It should work the same as the DialogCellEditor with the button always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this issue is related to us or SWT.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet in the application.\n2. Try to edit a property that uses the ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Notice that the combo box does not resize properly to match the width of the property sheet column."
