  "title": "Bug 7752 - Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails.",
  "description": "When attempting to export multiple files with the same name but under different directories to a zip file, the operation fails. This issue prevents users from correctly exporting their projects.",
  "OB": "When attempting to export files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, the operation fails, and an error message is displayed.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the zip file should be able to store files with the same name under different directories without any errors. For example, if you have two files named 'foo.txt' in different projects, the export should handle this correctly without issues.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Launch the WSWB application.\n2. Create two projects.\n3. Under each project, create a new file with the same name, e.g., 'foo.txt'.\n4. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and choose 'Zip File' as the export format."
