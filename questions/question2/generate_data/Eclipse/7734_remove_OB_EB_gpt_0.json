  "title": "System Shutdown Does Not Prompt to Save Dirty Files",
  "description": "When shutting down the WSWB application on Windows, there is no prompt to save unsaved changes in text files, resulting in potential data loss.",
  "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file.",
  "EB": "When shutting down WSWB on Windows, users should receive a warning or confirmation message that prompts them to save any unsaved changes in their text files before the computer is shut down or rebooted.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start WSWB and create a new project.\n2. Create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it.\n3. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file.\n4. Left click on the Windows Start menu, select the 'Shut Down' command to shut down or reboot the computer.\n\nResults: There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty text files, and the computer is shut down or rebooted immediately. This behavior differs from other Windows programs like Word and Outlook, which prompt users to save unsaved changes."
