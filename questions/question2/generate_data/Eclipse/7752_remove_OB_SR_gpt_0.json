  "title": "Exporting Multiple Files with the Same Name Under Different Directories to a Zip File Fails",
  "description": "When trying to export multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, the operation fails.",
  "OB": "When attempting to export multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, the software does not handle the naming conflict properly, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the software should successfully export multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file without any issues. It should differentiate the files based on their directory structure, ensuring that the zip file can store files with the same name under different directories without conflicts.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the software and create Project 1.\n2. Add a file named 'foo.txt' to Project 1.\n3. Create Project 2.\n4. Add a file named 'foo.txt' to Project 2.\n5. Attempt to export both projects to a zip file.\n6. Observe the error or unexpected behavior that occurs when exporting files with the same name under different directories."
