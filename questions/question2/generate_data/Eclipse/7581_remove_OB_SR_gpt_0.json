  "title": "Bug 7581: ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet",
  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com> wrote in message news:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...",
  "OB": "The ComboBoxCellEditor does not resize properly in the property sheet. It does not match the width of the property sheet column.",
  "EB": "I would have expected the behavior where the combo box is always the same width as the property sheet column. This should work the same as DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. We need to investigate to determine if this is an issue with our implementation or with SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit).",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the property sheet in the application.\n2. Try to edit a property using ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. Notice that the combo box does not match the width of the property sheet column as it should."
