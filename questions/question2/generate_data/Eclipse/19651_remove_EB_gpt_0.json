  "title": "Bug 19651: Team menu disappears from Hierarchy and Packages view.",
  "description": "The team menu is missing from the Hierarchy and Packages view, specifically noted in step 9. Please note that TestClass.java is not in any CVS repository, but I first observed this issue with a file managed by CVS.",
  "OB": "In step 15, after selecting the TestClass in the package view and attempting to open the popup menu, the team menu is no longer available.",
  "EB": "The team menu should be accessible in step 15 when selecting the TestClass in the package view's popup menu.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open Eclipse with a new workspace.\n2. Switch to the Java perspective and close the Resource perspective if open.\n3. Create a Java Project named 'TestProject'.\n4. Create a Java class named 'TestClass'.\n5. Paste the provided code into 'TestClass' and save it.\n6. Change the preference 'Workbench Perspective' to 'Open perspective in a new window'.\n7. Change the preference 'Java' to 'Open a new Type Hierarchy Perspective'.\n8. Exit the workbench and restart it.\n9. Select the 'TestClass' (the class, not the unit) in the package view and open the popup menu (team menu should be visible, even if disabled).\n10. Exit the workbench and restart it again.\n11. Select the word 'InnerClass' in the text editor and press F4.\n12. Open the popup menu on the new hierarchy view (team menu should not be present, which is expected for an inner class).\n13. Select the word 'TestClass' in the new text editor and press F4 (team menu should be present since it's not an inner class).\n14. You should have three open windows; close the two new windows.\n15. Select the 'TestClass' in the package view and attempt to open the popup menu (the team menu should be available but is missing, indicating the bug)."
