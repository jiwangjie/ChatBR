  "OB": "In build 20021001, when you ensure that you get a welcome page after a restart (by removing the welcome line in prefstore.ini of the workbench metadata), and then you click on any link in the welcome page, the appropriate action is executed. However, when you return to the welcome page, the clicked link is not visually selected. Currently, the ProductInfoDialog dialog implements this behavior, but it would be beneficial if links were also selected when clicked to provide more context to the user upon their return to the welcome page.",
