  "title": "Bug 18335 - Perspective contents lost when view is maximized",
  "description": "When maximizing a view in any perspective (F1), all the contents of the perspective, including other views and layout information, are lost. It appears that the view maximize code replaces the page layout with a temporary one containing only the maximized view.",
  "OB": "Upon maximizing a view in any perspective (F1), all perspective contents, such as other views and layout information, are lost. Only the maximized view remains visible, and all other views are missing from the perspective.",
  "EB": "When maximizing a view in any perspective (F1), the expected behavior is that the maximized view should expand to fill the available space, while other views and layout information within the perspective should remain intact and visible.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open any perspective in F1.\n2. Maximize a view within that perspective.Observe that all other views and layout information in the perspective disappear, leaving only the maximized view visible."
