  "title": "Bug 7752: Exporting multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file fails.",
  "description": "When attempting to export multiple files with the same name under different directories to a zip file, an error occurs. Follow the steps below to reproduce the issue.",
  "OB": "In the 'Export' dialog window, select both projects created earlier. Give the zip file a name (e.g., 'test.zip') and begin the export to a zip file. The result is an error message box that pops up, indicating that problems were encountered during the export. The error details list the file with the same name in 'project2' as the problem.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the software should successfully export multiple files with the same name under different directories to the zip file without encountering any problems.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Launch WSWB and create two projects.\n2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (e.g., 'foo.txt').\n3. From the main menu, select 'File' > 'Export' and choose 'Zip File' to export.\n4. In the 'Export' dialog, select both projects, provide a name for the zip file (e.g., 'test.zip'), and initiate the export process."
