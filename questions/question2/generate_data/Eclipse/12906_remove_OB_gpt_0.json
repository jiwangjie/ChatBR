  "description": "When attempting to open a file that is already opened in one editor, there is no warning or error message. A warning message or error message should be displayed.",
  "OB": "When opening a Java file that is already opened in the workbench, there is no warning or error message displayed. The file simply opens in the workbench without any notification.",
  "EB": "However, there should be a warning message or error message. If a user tries to open a Java file that is already open in the workbench, they should receive a warning message informing them that they may overwrite changes in the file and asking if they want to continue, or an error message telling them to close all file instances first. This feature is essential to prevent accidental overwrites or data loss.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure you have an associated Windows editor for your Java file. If not, go to the file explorer, double-click on any Java file, and select WordPad or Notepad as the default editor for all Java files.\n2. In the Java Perspective, right-click on the Java file and select 'Open With' > 'System Editor.' This will open the file in Notepad or WordPad. Close the editor window.\n3. In the Java Perspective, open a Java file by simply double-clicking on it. The file is now opened in the workbench.\n4. Right-click on the same Java file and select 'Open With' > 'System Editor' again.\n5. Observe that nothing happens. There should be a warning message displayed, indicating that you may overwrite changes in the file and asking if you want to continue, or an error message stating that you should close all file instances first.\n\nWe believe that this behavior is a safety feature to prevent external editing while the file is already opened in the workbench."
