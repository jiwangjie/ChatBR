  "OB": "When I create a working set with one project and select it, the package view is filtered.",
  "EB": "I expect that when I remove a working set, it should not immediately make any changes to the package view. It should only remove the working set without affecting the package view.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a working set with one project and select it, so the package view is filtered.\n2. Open the working set dialog again.\n3. Create a second working set.\n4. Delete the first working set."
