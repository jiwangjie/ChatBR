  "title": "Bug 2120 - MRU File List is not persisted between sessions (1GE71Z0)",
  "description": "The Most Recently Used (MRU) File List is not being saved between sessions, causing inconvenience to users.",
  "OB": "The MRU File List is not saved when the workbench is closed and reopened. As a result, the list is empty every time the workbench is restarted, even if multiple files were opened during the previous session.",
  "EB": "The MRU File List should be persisted between sessions. It is expected that when users close and restart the workbench, the list should contain the most recently accessed files from the previous session. This behavior is essential for user convenience and productivity.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start the workbench.\n2. Open 2 or 3 files.\n3. Close the workbench.\n4. Restart the workbench.\n5. Observe that the MRU File List is empty, and the previously opened files are not listed as expected."
