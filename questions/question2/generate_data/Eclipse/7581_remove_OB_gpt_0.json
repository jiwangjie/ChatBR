  "title": "Bug 7581 - ComboBoxCellEditor does not size correctly in property sheet",
  "description": "From ECJoe Winchester <JoeWin@us.ibm.com wrote in messagenews:3C407F76.31A82113@us.ibm.com...",
  "OB": "The combo box in the PropertySheetViewer does not resize correctly in the property sheet. When the string in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, the combo box grows to be the width of the largest item. As a result, the drop-down button may be pushed too far to the right and off the visible area of the property sheet, making it inaccessible to the user.",
  "EB": "I would have expected the combo box to always be the width of the property sheet column. It should work the same way as the DialogCellEditor, where the button is always visible. I believe this behavior needs to be investigated to determine if it's an issue with our implementation or with SWT.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Use the PropertySheetViewer to edit objects with rows of name-value pairs in two columns, defined by an IPropertyDescriptor.\n2. Use the IPropertyDescriptor method to create a cell editor that includes a ComboBoxCellEditor.\n3. When constructing the ComboBoxCellEditor, provide strings with varying widths.\n4. The editor appears in column two of the property sheet, and the drop-down button appears at the right edge of the column.\n5. If any of the strings in the combo box is wider than the width of the property sheet column, you will notice the problem described.\n6. The combo box will grow to match the width of the widest item, potentially pushing the drop-down button out of the visible area of the property sheet. As a result, the button becomes inaccessible to the user, and they would need to widen the property sheet view to make the button visible again."
