  "title": "Bug 22360[Fonts] FontRegistry MissingResourceException",
  "description": "When attempting to instantiate FontRegistry with resources located outside org.eclipse.jface.resource, a MissingResourceException is encountered. All the resources being accessed are relative to the FontRegistry class in org.eclipse.jface.resource. To resolve this issue, it's suggested to allow FontRegistry to take a client class or class loader as an additional parameter in the constructor.",
  "OB": "When trying to create a FontRegistry instance in my application using the following code:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\nFontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");}\nI encounter a MissingResourceException.",
  "EB": "I expect that when I create a FontRegistry instance with resources located in \"com.company.product.fonts,\" it should work without throwing a MissingResourceException.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in your project, e.g., com.company.product.MyClass.\n2. Inside this class, create a method to create a FontRegistry instance:\n\n```java\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}```\n3. Ensure that there is a file named \"fonts.properties\" in the \"com/company/product/\" folder.\n4. Call the `createFontRegistry` method.\n5. Observe the MissingResourceException.\n\nAdditionally, try the following alternative approach and observe that there is no exception:\n\n1. Create a class in your project, e.g., com.company.product.MyClass.\n2. Inside this class, create a method to obtain a ResourceBundle:\n\n```java\npublic void createFontRegistry(){\n    ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}```\n3. Call the `createFontRegistry` method.\n4. Confirm that there is no exception."
