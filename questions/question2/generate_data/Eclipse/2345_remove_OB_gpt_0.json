  "OB": "When attempting to open a file with a different type of editor that is already open, nothing happens. It simply reactivates the scripted resource editor example, even though the file type is different.",
  "EB": "Reproduce the steps in 1GEWMOZ:\n- Create a new basic project.\n- Create a new file named 'test.xml'.\n- The editor used by default is the scripted resource editor example, which ignores the XML file content.\n- In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'.\n- Choose 'Open With...' and then select 'Default Text Editor'.\n- Expected behavior: A new editor should open for 'test.xml' with the default text editor, as the editor type is different.",
