  "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When using the Linux operating system and running build 20011127, I observed that the close button moves down when the view is resized smaller. This behavior is not present in build 20011116 on Windows NT 2000. Specifically, in a view like the Navigator, when you resize it to a smaller size, the tool items shift below the label. However, the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the close icon (X) also move downwards. This unexpected behavior may confuse users.",
  "EB": "I expect that when a view, such as the Navigator, is resized to a smaller dimension, the close button and other icons should remain in their original positions and not shift downward. Users should not experience confusion due to the movement of these icons when resizing the view.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the application on a Linux system with build 20011127.\n2. Go to a view that contains a close button, for example, the Navigator.\n3. Resize the view to a smaller dimension.\n4. Observe that the close button, pulldown menu icon (triangle), and other icons move downward as you resize the view."
