  "OB": "When a file is already open in one editor, if you go to the Java Perspective and attempt to open a Java file by double-clicking on it, the file is opened in the workbench. Afterward, right-click on the Java file and choose 'Open With' -> 'System Editor.' When this is done, nothing happens. The expected behavior is that the workbench should display a warning message, indicating that you may overwrite changes and asking if you want to continue. Alternatively, it should show an error message stating that you need to close all files first. We believe this behavior is intended as a safety feature, preventing external editing while a file is already open in the workbench.",
