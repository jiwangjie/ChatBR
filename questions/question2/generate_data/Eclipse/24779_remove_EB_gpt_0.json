  "description": "Bug 24779[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed. It already tried, and it can't.8.",
  "OB": "When a non-displayed perspective contains an invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed), an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message is displayed after each launch of Eclipse until the perspective is displayed once. However, even after removing the plugin, closing and restarting Eclipse, the same error message persists. The workbench is attempting to create this view again.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when a perspective contains an invalid view due to a removed plugin, no 'Unable to restore perspective' error message should be displayed after removing the plugin and restarting Eclipse. The workbench should not attempt to recreate the view.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open Eclipse and open a view that belongs to a plugin that can be easily added and removed (e.g., use the EditorList plugin).\n2. Open another perspective (e.g., the 'Java' perspective).\n3. You now have two opened perspectives. Close Eclipse.\n4. Remove or move the plugin.\n5. Switch to the perspective which contains the view that no longer exists.\n6. You will encounter the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message.\n7. Close and restart Eclipse, and the error message should no longer appear."
