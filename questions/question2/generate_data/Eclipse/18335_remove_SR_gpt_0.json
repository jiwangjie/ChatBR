  "title": "Bug 18335 - Perspective contents lost when view is maximized",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When a view is maximized in any perspective in F1, all the contents of the perspective, including other views and layout information, are lost. Only the maximized view remains visible, and all other views disappear. It seems that the view maximize code replaces the page layout with a temporary one that contains only the maximized view.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the temporary layout should not persist, and the proper layout with all views should be restored when the workbench is closed.",
  "SR": "1. Open F1.\n2. Select any perspective.\n3. Maximize a view within the perspective.\n4. Observe that only the maximized view is present, and all other views have disappeared. \n5. Close the workbench.\n6. Upon reopening the workbench, check if the proper layout with all views is restored."
