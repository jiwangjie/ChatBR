  "title": "Bug 7734 - System Shutdown Without Savefile Warnings",
  "description": "When shutting down Windows while a WSWB session is open with unsaved changes in a .txt file, the system does not display any warning or prompt to save the changes, resulting in potential data loss.",
  "OB": "When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file without any warning or prompt to save.",
  "EB": "Expected Behavior: When attempting to shut down or reboot the computer with unsaved changes in a .txt file within a WSWB session, users should be presented with a warning or a message box that allows them to save their unsaved changes before the system proceeds with the shutdown/reboot. This behavior is consistent with other Windows programs like Word and Outlook.",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Start WSWB.\n2. Create a new project within WSWB.\n3. Create a text file in the project.\n4. Add a line of text to the newly created text file.\n5. Notice that the text file is marked as a 'dirty' file, indicating unsaved changes.\n6. Left-click on the Windows Start menu.\n7. Select the 'Shut Down' or 'Reboot' command to initiate the computer shutdown or reboot.\n8. Result: The system shuts down or reboots immediately without displaying a warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their unsaved changes. This behavior differs from other Windows programs like Word and Outlook, which do provide such warnings."
