  "description": "The Team menu disappears in the step \"9\". Note: TestClass.java is not in any CVS repository, but I first saw the problem with a file managed by CVS.",
  "OB": "In step 9, when selecting the TestClass in the package view and opening the popup menu, the Team menu is present but disabled.",
  "EB": "In step 9, when selecting the TestClass in the package view and opening the popup menu, the Team menu should be present and enabled, as it is not an inner class.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open Eclipse with a new workspace.\n2. Open the Java perspective and close the resource perspective.\n3. Create a Java Project named \"TestProject\".\n4. Create a Java class named \"TestClass\".\n5. Paste the provided code into TestClass and save it.\n6. Change the preference 'WorkbenchPerspective' to open the perspective in a new window.\n7. Change the preference 'Java' to 'Open a new Type Hierarchy Perspective'.\n8. Exit the workbench and restart it.\n9. Select the TestClass (the class, not the unit) in the package view and open the popup menu. Observe that the Team menu is present but disabled.\n10. Exit the workbench and restart it again.\n11. Select the word 'InnerClass' in the text editor and press F4.\n12. Open the popup menu in the new hierarchy view. Observe that the Team menu is not there, but this is expected as it is an inner class.\n13. Select the word 'TestClass' in the new text editor and press F4. Observe that the Team menu is not there, but it should be since it is not an inner class.\n14. You should have three opened windows. Close the two new windows.\n15. Select the TestClass in the package view and open the popup menu. Observe that the Team menu is not there anymore."
