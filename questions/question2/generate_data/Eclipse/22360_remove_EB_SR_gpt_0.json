  "title": "Bug 22360[Fonts] FontRegistry MissingResourceException",
  "description": "FontRegistry cannot be instantiated using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource. All the resources being looked up are relative to the location of the FontRegistry class in the org.eclipse.jface.resource path. This issue could be resolved by allowing FontRegistry to take a client class or class loader as an additional parameter to the constructor.",
  "OB": "When attempting to create a FontRegistry instance in my application, I encounter a MissingResourceException. The code I use for this is as follows:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry() {\n  FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nI have a file named 'fonts.properties' in the 'com/company/product/' folder. However, when I use the following code instead:\n\ncom.company.product.MyClass\npublic void createFontRegistry() {\n  ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"com.company.product.fonts\");\n}\n\nNo exception is thrown. Additionally, if I duplicate the FontRegistry class in my 'com.company.product' package, it works. I suspect there is a bug in the FontRegistry because it attempts to load the fonts resource bundle using the FontRegistry's class loader (refer to 'readResourceBundle(String)' method in FontRegistry).",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that creating a FontRegistry instance should not result in a MissingResourceException when using resources located outside the 'org.eclipse.jface.resource' path. The FontRegistry should allow for the use of a client class or class loader as an additional parameter in its constructor to resolve this issue.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class, for example, 'com.company.product.MyClass'.\n2. Add a method, 'createFontRegistry()', that attempts to create a FontRegistry instance using a resource path outside the 'org.eclipse.jface.resource' location.\n3. Call the 'createFontRegistry()' method.\n4. Observe the MissingResourceException being thrown."
