  "title": "Bug 19933: Emacs Keybinding Service Always Clears Status Line",
  "description": "When running in Emacs keybindings mode, any action that writes to the status line gets cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. However, there is currently no API available to retrieve the message in the status line, making it impossible to address the issue in a general manner. Some cases can be resolved by avoiding the status line clearance in the default mode.",
  "OB": "When running in Emacs keybindings mode, any action that writes to the status line will have the status line message cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode. When a mode is entered, the keysequence that initiated the mode is written to the status line.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that AcceleratorScope.resetMode should clear the status line only after the appropriate action has been executed.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch the application with Emacs keybindings enabled.\n2. Perform any action that writes to the status line (e.g., open a file or execute a command).\n3. Observe that the message in the status line is cleared by AcceleratorScope.resetMode, even though the action has been completed."
