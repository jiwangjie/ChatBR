  "OB": "The following issues and suggestions have been identified:\n1. Multiple selection is not enabled for the associated editors.\n2. The default entry in the associated editors list is not clearly marked as '(default).' (Refer to perspectives)\n3. The dialog lacks a width hint, affecting its visual appearance.\n4. The 'File Editors' Preferences page increases in height when selected, unlike other pages.\n",
  "EB": "Expected Behavior:\n1. Users should be able to select multiple associated editors.\n2. The default entry in the associated editors list should be clearly marked as '(default).' (Refer to perspectives)\n3. The dialog should have a width hint to improve its visual presentation.\n4. The 'File Editors' Preferences page should behave consistently with other pages, not increasing in height when selected.\n",
  "SR": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the WorkbenchFile Editors preference page.\n2. Without selecting anything from the 'Internal Editors' section, go to 'External Editors' and select an entry.\n3.
