  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new basic project.\n2. Create a new file named 'test.xml'.\n3. The editor used by default is the scripted resource editor example.\n4. In the Navigator, select 'test.xml'.\n5. Right-click and choose 'Open With...' > 'Default Text Editor'.\n6. Observe that nothing happens, and the scripted resource editor example is reactivated.\n\nExpected behavior: Selecting 'Default Text Editor' should open a new editor for 'test.xml' due to the different editor type."
