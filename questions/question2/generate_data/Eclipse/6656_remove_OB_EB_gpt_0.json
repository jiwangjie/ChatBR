  "description": "The issue occurs on Linux, specifically when running build 20011127. This problem was not present in build 20011116 on Windows 2000. When resizing a view, such as the Navigator, to a smaller size, the tool items shift below the label.",
  "OB": "When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move below the label.",
  "EB": "When resizing a view like the Navigator to a smaller size, the tool items should stay aligned with the label and not move down.",
  "SR": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Launch the application on Linux with build 20011127.\n2. Open the Navigator view.\n3. Resize the Navigator view to make it smaller.\n4. Observe how the tool items shift below the label, which is the unexpected behavior."
