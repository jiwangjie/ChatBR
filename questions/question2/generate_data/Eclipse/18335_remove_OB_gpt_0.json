  "title": "Bug 18335 - Perspective contents lost when view is maximized",
  "description": "When switching between perspectives in the workbench, the contents of a maximized view are not being preserved as expected.",
  "OB": "When switching between perspectives in the workbench, the contents of a maximized view are not being preserved, and the view reverts to its default state.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when switching between perspectives in the workbench, the contents of a maximized view should be preserved, and the view should not revert to its default state. This temporary layout must be getting persisted instead of the proper layout when the workbench is closed.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Switch to another perspective in the workbench.\n2. Exit the workbench.\n3. Open the workbench again.\n4. Switch to the perspective with the maximized view. The view's contents should not be preserved, and it should revert to its default state."
