  "title": "Bug 6656 - Close button moves down when view resized smaller",
  "description": "",
  "OB": "When resizing the view, such as the Navigator, to a smaller size on Linux with build 20011127 (not observed on build 20011116 on Nt2000), the close button, along with the pulldown menu icon (triangle), moves below the label. This behavior can potentially confuse users.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the close button and the pulldown menu icon should remain on the same line as the label, regardless of how small the view becomes. Users are accustomed to the close button being on the same line as the label, positioned at the far right corner.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the Navigator or a similar view on Linux with build 20011127.\n2. Resize the view to a smaller size.\n3. Observe the close button and pulldown menu icon (triangle) moving below the label."
