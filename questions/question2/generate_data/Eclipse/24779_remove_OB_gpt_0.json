  "description": "Bug 24779[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed. It already tried, and it can't.8.",
  "OB": "Invalid views are not removed from the perspective, causing an 'Unable to restore perspective' error message.",
  "EB": "The plugin was not available the last time Eclipse was closed, so the workbench should have no more references to this plugin's views.",
  "SR": "1. Open Eclipse. 2. Open a view that belongs to a plugin you can easily add and remove (I used the EditorList plugin). 3. Open another perspective (e.g., the 'Java' perspective). You now have two opened perspectives. 4. Close Eclipse. 5. Remove or move the plugin. 6. Switch to the perspective which contains the view that no longer exists. You will encounter the 'Unable to restore perspective' error message. 7. Close and restart Eclipse. You should no longer receive error messages."
