  "EB": "Upon switching to the Master Page viewer, the expected behavior is for the Property Editor to reflect the properties of the Master Page. The actual result is that it still shows the properties of the layout items, which is not as expected.",
  "SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to a page with layout items.\n3. Switch to the Master Page viewer."
