  "title": "Bug 151938 - Handling Duplicate javaagent Entries More Gracefully",
  "description": "This issue concerns the handling of duplicate javaagent entries when using AspectJ's loadtime weaver with a java 5 VM. Instead of emitting excessive bytecode, a more graceful handling is expected.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that when starting a java 5 VM with AspectJ's loadtime weaver specified more than once using the javaagent flag, and if there is an aop.xml file defined, the system encounters issues. It attempts to reweave the woven AspectJ code and generates massive amounts of bytecode. If the script is wrapped twice, it can result in a duplicate issue.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when starting a java 5 VM with multiple entries of AspectJ's loadtime weaver using the javaagent flag and an aop.xml file defined, the system should handle this situation more gracefully. Rather than emitting excessive bytecode or attempting to reweave, it should ideally fail and provide an error message to the user, indicating the issue with duplicate entries.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Start a java 5 VM.\n2. Specify AspectJ's loadtime weaver more than once using the javaagent flag.\n3. Ensure that there is an aop.xml file defined.\n4. Observe the system's behavior as it attempts to reweave AspectJ code and emits massive amounts of bytecode."
