This issue was observed while working with AJDT and may result in false positives during error detection due to the absence of filename checking in harness verification of messages.",

  "EB": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed as 'app/Main' instead of 'app.Main.class'.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the code from 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'\n2. Observe the declare warning messages related to .class files in injars."
