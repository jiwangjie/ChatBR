  "description": "The bug report addresses an issue with declare warning messages related to binary files in [java|aj]. It recommends running tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' to observe the problem. The report notes limitations in the tests due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages.",
  "OB": "When targeting .class files from injars in declare warning messages, the source path is incorrectly listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of the expected 'app/Main'. The report also mentions cases where filenames do not appear at all.",
  "EB": "In declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be correctly formatted as 'app/Main' instead of the incorrect 'app.Main.class' or missing filenames.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the tests located in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'\n2. Ensure that filename checking is enabled in harness verification of messages to detect errors accurately."
