"title": "Bug 37021 - Source path wrong in declare warning on binary files",
"description": "This bug report addresses an issue related to declare warning messages on binary files in [java|aj]. The report suggests running tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' to observe the problem. It also mentions limitations in the tests related to filename checking.",
"OB": "The observed behavior is that in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of the expected 'app/Main'. There is also mention of filenames not appearing at all in some cases.",
"EB": "The expected behavior is not explicitly stated in the report. However, it is reasonable to expect that the source path in declare warning messages should be in the correct format, such as 'app/Main'.",
"SR": "To effectively address this issue, more information about the expected behavior and specific user actions required should be provided. Additionally, clear and complete steps to reproduce the problem are essential for understanding and resolving the issue."
