  "title": "Bug 38131 - ajc Needs '-d .' Option for Correct Compilation of Subpackages",
  "description": "The bug report discusses a regression in the AspectJ Compiler (ajc) version 1.1rc1 compared to javac. When compiling classes from subpackages, ajc creates an additional 'subpackage' directory. The report suggests that this may be related to changes in the underlying Eclipse compiler.",
  "OB": "When compiling a class from a subpackage using the command 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java,' it generates a 'subpackage' directory within the existing 'subpackage' directory. This behavior causes issues when running the 'java' command, resulting in a 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError' for 'subpackage/Test.'",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is for ajc to compile subpackages without creating duplicate subdirectories, similar to the behavior of 'javac.'",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a class in a subpackage, e.g., 'subpackage/Test.java.'\n2. Compile the class using the command 'ajc subpackage\\Test.java.'\n3. Observe that an additional 'subpackage' directory is created under the existing 'subpackage' directory. To resolve the problem, use the '-d .' option with 'ajc' or compile the class using 'javac subpackage\\Test.java.'"
