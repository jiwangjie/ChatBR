"title": "Bug 47910 - Missing MANIFEST.MF in outjar jarfile",
"description": "The reported issue involves the absence of a MANIFEST.MF file inside the generated .jar file.",
"OB": "When executing the command 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar,' it creates an output file with a .jar extension. However, the resulting file is not a valid jar file because it does not contain a MANIFEST.MF file. The documentation for 'ajc' mentions using 'outjar <file' to put output classes in a zip file, but having a parameter named 'outjar' that is supposed to create a zip file seems counterintuitive.",
"EB": "The expected behavior is that when the 'ajc' command is run as described, it should create a valid .jar file. This .jar file should contain the necessary MANIFEST.MF file to be considered a valid Java archive.",
"SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Execute the following command: 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar'\n2. Check the generated 'my.jar' file for the presence of a MANIFEST.MF file. It should be missing."
