  "description": "The issue is related to the Property Editor displaying the properties of layout items when switching to the Master Page viewer.",
  "OB": "N/A",
  "EB": "When switching to the Master Page, the expected behavior is for the Property Editor to change to reflect Master Page properties, providing the necessary context for editing the Master Page. However, in the actual behavior, it still displays the properties of the label or layout item.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new report.\n2. Insert a label or any layout item on the report.\n3. Select the label or layout item. (Property Editor should show the properties of the selected item)\n4. Switch to the Master Page viewer and observe that the Property Editor still shows the properties of the label or layout item instead of Master Page properties."
