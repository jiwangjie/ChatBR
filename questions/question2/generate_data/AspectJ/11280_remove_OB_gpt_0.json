  "description": "This bug report pertains to the issue of view maximization not being retained when switching between perspectives in the software.",
  "OB": "Upon switching perspectives, the CVS repository view is no longer maximized, which is not the expected behavior. A maximized view should remain maximized.",

  "SR": "To reproduce this issue, please follow these steps:\n1. Open the CVS repository view in the Java perspective.\n2. Maximize the view by double-clicking the title bar.\n3. Switch to the resource perspective.\n4. Return to the Java perspective."
