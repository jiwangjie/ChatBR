"title": "Bug 47910 - Missing MANIFEST.MF in outjar jarfile",
"description": "The reported issue concerns the absence of a MANIFEST.MF file inside the generated .jar file with a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside.",
"OB": "N/A",
"EB": "When the 'outjar' parameter is used with 'ajc,' the resulting file should be a valid jar file, which means it should contain the required MANIFEST.MF file.",
"SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Execute the following command: 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar'\n2. Check the generated 'my.jar' file for the presence of a MANIFEST.MF file. It should be missing."
