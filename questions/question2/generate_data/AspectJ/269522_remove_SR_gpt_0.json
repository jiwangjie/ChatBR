  "description": "This bug report addresses a problem related to the Cross Reference view and markers mixing up joinpoints assigned to advice.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior includes the following issues:\n1. When selecting line 22, you can observe 5 joinpoints, but there should only be 3.\n2. When selecting line 68, you see zero joinpoints, even though there should be 2.\n3. Right-clicking the marker at line 68 and choosing 'advises' reveals all 5 joinpoints instead of the expected 2.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be as follows:\n1. When selecting line 22, you should see only 3 joinpoints, not 5.\n2. When selecting line 68, it should display 2 joinpoints, not zero.\n3. Right-clicking the marker at line 68 and choosing 'advises' should reveal only the 2 relevant joinpoints, not all 5.",
