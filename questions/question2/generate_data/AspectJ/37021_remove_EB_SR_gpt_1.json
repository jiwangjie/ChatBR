  "title": "Bug 37021 - Incorrect Source Path in Declare Warning on Binary Files",
  "description": "When using declare warning messages on .class files from injars, the source path is incorrectly formatted as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'. Sometimes, the filenames do not appear at all in these messages. Note that these tests may also produce false positives due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is that in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed as 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main.class'. Sometimes, the filenames do not appear at all, but these tests do not reproduce that problem.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior should be that the source path in declare warning messages for .class files should be correctly formatted as 'app/Main.class' without any missing filenames.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Run the tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/'\n2. Observe the declare warning messages for .class files from injars."
