"title": "Bug 37021 - Source path wrong in declare warning on binary files",
"description": "This bug report discusses an issue with declare warning messages related to binary files in [java|aj]. It suggests running tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' to reproduce the problem. The report mentions limitations in the tests due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages.",
"OB": "The observed behavior is not explicitly described in the report.",
"EB": "The expected behavior is that in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path should be listed in the form 'app/Main' rather than 'app.Main.class'.",
"SR": "To reproduce this issue:\n1. Run tests from 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'\n2. Observe the source path in declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars and note that it appears in the form 'app.Main.class' instead of 'app/Main'."
