"description": "This bug report discusses an issue with declare warning messages related to binary files in [java|aj]. It suggests running tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..' to reproduce the problem. The report mentions limitations in the tests due to filename checking not being enabled in harness verification of messages.",
"OB": "The observed behavior, including any unexpected output or actions, is not explicitly described in the report.",
"EB": "The expected behavior is not provided in the report.",
"SR": "To address this issue:\n1. Review and update the tests in 'tests/new/binaryWarnings/..'.\n2. Verify that in declare warning messages targeting .class files from injars, the source path is listed in the form 'app/Main' rather than 'app.Main.class'."
