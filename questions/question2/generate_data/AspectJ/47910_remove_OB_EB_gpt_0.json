"description": "The issue is related to the absence of a METAINF/MANIFEST.MF file inside the generated .jar file.",
"OB": "N/A",

"SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Execute the following command: 'ajc sourceroots <mydir outjar <my.jar'\n2. Examine the generated 'my.jar' file for the presence of a MANIFEST.MF file. It should be missing."
