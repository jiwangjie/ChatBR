  "title": "Bug 11280 [View Mgmt] Switching perspectives loses view maximized state",
  "description": "When switching between different perspectives in the application, the maximized state of the CVS repository view is not maintained.",
  "OB": "When changing perspectives, the CVS repository view, which was previously maximized, gets restored to its regular size. It should remain maximized as expected.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that when switching perspectives, the CVS repository view, which has been maximized by the user, should remain in the maximized state even after the perspective change.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Maximize the CVS repository view.\n3. Switch to a different perspective within the application.\n4. Observe that the CVS repository view is no longer maximized, which is not the expected behavior."
