  "description": "This bug report addresses an issue where the Cross Reference view and markers incorrectly handle the assignment of joinpoints to advice.",
  "OB": "The observed behavior is as follows:\n1. Selecting line 22 displays 5 joinpoints (expected: 3).\n2. Choosing line 68 shows no joinpoints (expected: 2).\n3. Right-clicking the marker at line 68 and selecting 'advises' displays all 5 joinpoints.",
  "EB": "The expected behavior is that the Cross Reference view and markers correctly handle joinpoints assigned to advice:\n1. Selecting line 22 should show 3 joinpoints.\n2. Choosing line 68 should display 2 joinpoints.\n3. Right-clicking the marker at line 68 and choosing 'advises' should only show the joinpoints relevant to that line.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1. Open the attached project and perform a clean compile.\n2. Open the Cross Reference view.\n3. Select line 22 and observe the incorrect display of 5 joinpoints instead of 3.\n4. Choose line 68 to note the absence of joinpoints instead of the expected 2.\n5. Right-click the marker at line 68 and select 'advises' to see all 5 joinpoints rather than just 2."
