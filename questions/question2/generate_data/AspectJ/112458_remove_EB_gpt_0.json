"title": "Bug 112458 - Property Editor Shows Layout Items' Properties in Master Page Viewer",
"description": "The issue pertains to the Property Editor displaying the properties of layout items when switching to the Master page viewer.",
"OB": "When switching to the Master Page viewer, the Property Editor continues to display the properties of layout items. This can be confusing for customers who might mistake it for the Master Page Editor and inadvertently set properties without first clicking on the Master Page viewer.",
"EB": "The expected behavior is that when switching to the Master Page viewer, the Property Editor should display properties related to the Master Page rather than layout items. It should provide the appropriate context for editing Master Page properties.",
"SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Create a new report.\n2. Insert a label on the report.\n3. Select the label. (Property Editor should show the label's properties)\n4. Switch to the Master Page viewer and observe that the Property Editor still displays the properties of layout items instead of Master Page properties."
