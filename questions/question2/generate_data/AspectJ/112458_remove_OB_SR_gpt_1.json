  "title": "Bug 112458 - Property Editor displays layout item properties in Master Page viewer",
  "description": "The Property Editor continues to display the properties of layout items when switching to the Master Page viewer.",
  "OB": "When switching to the Master Page viewer, the Property Editor displays the properties of layout items.",
  "EB": "When switching to the Master Page viewer, the expected behavior is for the Property Editor to change and reflect the properties of the Master Page. It should no longer display the properties of individual layout items.",
  "SR": "To reproduce the issue:\n1. Open the application.\n2. Navigate to the design or layout view.\n3. Select a layout item on the canvas.\n4. Switch to the Master Page viewer.\n5. Observe that the Property Editor still displays the properties of the selected layout item instead of showing the properties of the Master Page."
