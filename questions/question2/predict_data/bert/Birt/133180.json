The implementation class could contain a reader and a writer class, and implement the two interfaces through delagation.", "OB": "", "EB": " However, to support using report document as data source, and potentially even replace the report document during rendering, an interface/class that supports both read and write with the same object is needed.Because BIRT internal codes uses archive reader and writer frequently, it is desirable that the new class implements both the reader and writer interfaces. But this is not a requirement, but just a suggestion.The interface shuld also support a method isOpen() for checking whether the archive is already open.The interface should support file lock, i.e., read/write file lock.The class for now does not need to support synchronization between read/write. It is the caller's responsibility to do so, using the lock mechanism/method on the archive.Because the archive is a folder, concurrently read/write is an exception, instead of norm.", "SR": ""}
