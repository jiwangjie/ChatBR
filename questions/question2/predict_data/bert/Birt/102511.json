When the report is previewed,alternating rows have a background color for each cell. The issue is that thebackgrounds for the cells are not contiguous, there are spaces between eachcell's background, and if a cell has a null value there is no background color.In this situation the highlight should apply to the row, instead it is beingapplied to each cell. If I manually set the background of a detail row to begray I get the effect I want.", "EB": "", "SR": " In the designer, select the detailrow, go to the Highlights tab on the Property Editor view. Add a new highlight,set its condition to be \"row[0] % 2\" \"Equals\" \"0\". Set the formatting for thehighlight to have a gray background color. If I manually set the background of a detail row to begray I get the effect I want."}
