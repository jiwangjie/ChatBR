This property controls how intervalbased grouping picks the range of its initial group, and is an important part of rangebased grouping. The following is a suggested look of the UI control:Use fixed base value for interval: ( [] is a checkbox, underlineis a textbox ).", "OB": " When it is unchecked (maps to a NULL IntervalBase value), Data Engine dynamically picks a base value using the first group key value in the result set.", "EB": " BIRT designer's Group Details editor should allow user to edit IntervalBase for a group.This is how the editor should work: IntervalBase options should be presented only if \"Interval\" is not \"None\". (Since IntervalBase only makes sense for intervalbased grouping) IntervalBase should be presented in conjunction with checkbox. When it is checked, the user should input a base value.", "SR": ""}
