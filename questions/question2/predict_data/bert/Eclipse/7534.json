Under certain circumstances (wrong user inputs) I would like to temporarly disable the \"OK\" button and set the \"Cancel\" button as Default. The first part I realized by overwriting createButtonsForButtonBar protected void createButtonsForButtonBar(Composite parent) { btnOK = createButton(parent, IDialogConstants.OKID, IDialogConstants.OKLABEL, true); btnCancel =createButton(parent, IDialogConstants.CANCELID, IDialogConstants.CANCELLABEL, false); } By doing so I can set the defaultState in the beginning and get a reference for each button to disable them later. Now I am looking for a way to change the default state, because it makes no sence to have a disabled button as default. The problem seems to be, that the setDefault() method of a Button is not visible.I've replied that he can use getShell().setDefaultButton(Button).However, he should not have to copy the code in createButtonsForButtonBar justto be able to retrieve them later.We should consider adding a method to Dialog:/Returns the button with the given id. @param id ( copy the spec from createButton )@return the button with the given id, or <codenull</code if not found /Button getButton(int id);", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
