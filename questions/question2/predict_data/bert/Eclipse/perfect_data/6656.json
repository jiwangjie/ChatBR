However, so does the pulldown menu icon (triangle) and the closeicon (X). If it starts moving around, I think users will get confused.", "EB": " These two tool items use to stay on the same line as the label nomatter how small the view got.In my opinion, this is going to be a usuability problem. Users are accustomedto the close button being on the same line as the label and located to the farright corner.", "SR": " On linux, running build 20011127 (does not happen on build 20011116 on Nt2000).When a view like the Navigator is resized smaller, the tool items move belowthe label."}
