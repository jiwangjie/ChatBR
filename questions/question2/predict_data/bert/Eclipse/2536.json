{"id": "2536", "title": "Bug 2536Window lifecycle needed (1GFL2TW)", "description": " Bug 2536Window lifecycle needed (1GFL2TW) From Eclipse Corner (6/13/2001):It seems some obvious functionality is missing from IWorkbench. We need toknow when a new workbench window is opened or an existing one closed. Forexample:IWorkbench.addWorkbenchListener(IWorkbenchListener)IWorkbenchListener would contain, among other methods,windowOpened(IWorkbenchWindow)windowClosed(IWorkbenchWindow)etc...I've found a workaround. However, this is very ugly and it would be great ifsomeone could give an estimate when real listener support could be added toIWorkbench. I'm adding a ShellListener to the current WorkbenchWindow'sshell. If its not the original window, I know I've got anew one. I've discovered I must do the check in an asyncExec, because at thetime shellDeactivated is called, the original workbench window is still theactive one.NOTES:", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": " When I get a shellDeactivated, I check to see what theactiveWorkBenchWindow is."}
