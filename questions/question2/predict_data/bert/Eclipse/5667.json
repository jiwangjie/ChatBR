If you set it, and click on Apply, if you then click on ResetDefaults, it doesn't reset the checkbox as unselected.This may be a \"generic\" button, but in this context, the button should eitherbe removed or changed to \"Reset\" (which is defined as resetting those settingsto their value before the panel was entered, not the same as Undo).Thebutton \"Reset Defaults\" doesn't make a lot of sense in this context.I supposeyou could define the default readonly state as \"off\", then selecting thebutton would systematically reset the readonly bit...", "OB": " Bug 5667TVT: Reset Defaults button on resources Properties is misleading", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
