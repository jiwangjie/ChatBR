But they aren't.", "OB": " The tab handling in the editor has a few bugs.First of all, the column number showed in the right corner isn't correct whenusing tabs. The number is simply incremented by 4 (or the tab size you entered)indipendently how much whitespace is inserted. The column number of the first tabshould always be 5, and the second 9.The second point is that the representation of the tabs doesn't depend by thefont metrics. Only if you turn off the bold representation ofthe keywords, the text is shown correctly. Also, the position of the equal signsdepends by the font size.", "EB": "", "SR": " Take a look at the file enumeration.javaThe font size is set to 12 pt and the keywords are shown bold.All the equal signs should be in the same column (an they are, at least in another editor). Only if you turn off the bold representation ofthe keywords, the text is shown correctly."}
