It is spec'd to return the topmostfully visible line which leaves open this boundary condition.The current behavior in this case is unexpected from a visual point of view(i.e., from the users perspective).When the second of three lines is only partially visible (index 1) but the lineat index 2 is not visible at all (or also only partially visible) getTopIndexreturns 2 because that is the index of the line that would be fully visible ifthere was enough vertical space.This causes similar problems as reported in bug 8648 when moving the cursordown. When the cursor is moved from index 1 down the line at index 2 is notrevealed unless cursor down is pressed again.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
