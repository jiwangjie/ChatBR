If you stop the cursor on the correctpixel, the busy cursor changes back to the normal cursor.This behaviour was observed in F1 on Windows. LinuxMotif does not exhibit thisbehaviour.", "EB": " The busy cursor should be active for the entire ProgressMonitorDialog.To reproduce:1) Check something out of CVS that will take around 10 seconds.2) While the operation is in progress, mouse over the busy indicator.3) Depending on how fast you moved the cursor, you will see the cursor flashover the borders of the busy indicator.", "SR": ""}
