But if you click anywhere elseit won't work.In this particular case, TableTreeItem.getImageBounds() was returning a box thatwas lower than where you were clicking such that the event location onlyoverlapped the image bounds at the upperleft corner.However, there is also a problem in that getImageBounds() doesn't return arectangle with any dimensions many times. With the standard properties forthings like project, there are no expandable properties other than the \"info\"category. Though itwasn't consistent. It would return zerosized most of the time, but not all ofthe time.This makes the property sheet unusable for expanded properties and categories.", "EB": "", "SR": " If you select a project and try to clickon the +/ next to the \"Info\" category entry, it won't expand/collapse.In this particular case if you click just on the upperleft corner of the boxaround the +/ you may be able to get it to work."}
