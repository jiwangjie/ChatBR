(In our cases 70 calls. )In our project, this cycle is much to long. This memory can only be freedafter the threads have been removed from the CFlowStack.In our production code we sum up to more than 300 Threads stored in differentCFlowStack Varaibles. Often this results in out of memory Errors.Added patch provides an improved freeing scheme.It checks if the size of the table has grown, if it has, it checks if it canremove some threads.", "OB": " Problem:The current implementation of CFlowStack (Version 1.1till 1.2 rc1) stores allthreads in a hashtable. We have soveral long runningthreads, which grap quite a lot of lot of memory.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
