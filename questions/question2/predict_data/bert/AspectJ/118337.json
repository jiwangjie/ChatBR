The commented out code works just fine for me.Is there a real need to resolve the AspectJ runtime from a different classloader than the one that was already used to load this class from the AspectJ runtime?Class delegateClass = Class.forName(\"org.aspectj.weaver.reflect.Java15ReflectionBasedReferenceTypeDelegate\",false,usingClassLoader);//ReflectionBasedReferenceTypeDelegate.class.getClassLoader());", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
