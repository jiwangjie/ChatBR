(I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes nosense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)", "OB": " In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" rather than \"app/Main. I have also see the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do notreproduce that problem.", "EB": " In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" rather than \"app/Main.", "SR": " In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" rather than \"app/Main."}
