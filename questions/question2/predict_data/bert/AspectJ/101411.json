Basically the programmer needs to be engaged, it only affectsserializable classes and in 1.5 there is a warning if you don't declare thefield so there is a strong hint to the programmer to solve the problem. Generating suid when we add a static initializer (tosupport thisJoinPoint or the staticinitialization join point), accessormethods for privileged aspects or transient perfields is OK.", "EB": " Also we need to take care with ITD fieldsto ensure correct behaviour when sending and receiving from nonwovenclasses. ForLTW we should make an enhancement to allow the user to configure Lint andother things. For example they may or may not be interested in advice notmatching.Matthew WebsterAlex,We should make a distinction between benign changes to suid and those thataffect members.", "SR": ""}
