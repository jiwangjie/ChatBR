Consequentlyeach element in the path list is treated as a separate argument insteadof being part of one big string representing the sourcepath or classpath.", "OB": " Bug 61411AJDoc launch script on Windows can lose arguments Using AspectJ 1.2rc1 on Windows XPThis report highlights a problem that I've seen using ajdoc.bat on Windows butthe issue applies equally to the ajc.bat and ajbrowser.bat files as well.The %ASPECTJHOME%\\bin\\ajdoc.bat file that users run to launch the ajdoc toolimposes a limit of only 9 command line arguments that may be passed to theclass org.aspectj.tools.ajdoc.Main. In scenarios where there the sourcepath,classpath, d etc options are used it is easy for these to \"eat up\" the listof arguments that are passed into the JVM. A long list of packages enteredat the end of the ajdoc.bat command can be truncated or possibly even ignored(in which case an error message will be output telling the user that noclasses or packages have been specified).In order to prevent a limit being put on the number of arguments passed tothe launched JVM, the invocation line needs to end with % rather than the%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 list it currently uses.The proposed fix also seems (could somebody else confirm this ?) to sortout another problem regarding the ajdoc.bat file which is this : long semicolon delimited paths supplied as the arguments for the sourcepath andclasspath options seem to get split apart and passed into the JVM as separatearguments unless the entire path list is supplied inside quotes. It seems that the batch file processor interprets thesemicolons in a path list as delimiters between arguments.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
