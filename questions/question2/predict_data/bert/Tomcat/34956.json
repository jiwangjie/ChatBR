The software cannot be deployed later on a container whichconforms to the above paragraph and hence must be changed before deployment.This somehow contradicts the idea of having a standards based infrastructure.", "EB": " Tomcat should enforce the requirements from servlet 2.4 specification SRV.8.2SRV.8.2 Using a Request Dispatcher\"To use a request dispatcher, a servlet calls either the include method orforward method of the RequestDispatcher interface.", "SR": ""}
