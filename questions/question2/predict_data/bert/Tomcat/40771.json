{"id": "40771", "title": "Bug 40771Can't read POST data from within a filter or valve", "description": " I was attempting to create a Filter or Valve that could be placed in front of anAxis web service that would handle security according to the WSSecurityspecification. This is a chunk of code in a prototype Valve that didn't work:private ByteChunk getPOSTBody(Request request)throws IOException{ByteChunk retval = new ByteChunk(request.getContentLength());ByteChunk body = new ByteChunk(request.getContentLength());int bytesRead;do{bytesRead = request.getCoyoteRequest().doRead(body);retval.append(body);}while (bytesRead = 0) ;//puts the data back into the pipe.request.getCoyoteRequest().action(ActionCode.ACTIONREQSETBODYREPLAY, retval);return retval;}This code works as designed, however the problem occurs later on when Axisattempted to parse the web service request. I don't remember the exact Axiserror, but I was able to track the problem down to a bug in theorg.apache.coyote.http11.filters.SavedRequestInputFilter class. The doReadmethod was not properly implemented to return a 1 when appropriate.Here is my modified version of the doRead method:public int doRead(ByteChunk chunk, org.apache.coyote.Request request)throws IOException {int writeLength = 0;if (chunk.getLimit()0 && chunk.getLimit() < input.getLength()) {writeLength = chunk.getLimit();} else {writeLength = input.getLength();}if(input.getOffset()= input.getEnd())return 1;input.substract(chunk.getBuffer(), 0, writeLength);chunk.setOffset(0);chunk.setEnd(writeLength);return writeLength;}This bug won't show up unless someone tries to use a filter/valve to dosomething with web services. That's not too likely because that's what we haveSOAPHandlers for.", "OB": " Bug 40771Can't read POST data from within a filter or valve That turned out to be a rabbit trail, but I did find and fix abug that I discovered along the way.I ran into problems reading POST data (the web service request) from theorg.apache.catalina.connector.Request object exposed in the Filter/Valveinterfaces.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
