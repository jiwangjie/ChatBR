Connector.initialize() sets jkHome property on Http11NioProtocol. Http11NioProtocol sets jkHome property on NioEndpoint. Using embedded Tomcat. Using Nio connector. Happens in 6.0.18 and 6.0.20; haven't tested with earlier versions.", "OB": " The error is translated by Java's reflection mechanism to an InvocationTargetException, which is caught and silently ignored by IntrospectionUtils. NioEndpoint recursively invokes its own setProperty method via IntrospectionUtils.setProperty, causing the stack overflow. Does not happen for standard connector.", "EB": "", "SR": ""}
