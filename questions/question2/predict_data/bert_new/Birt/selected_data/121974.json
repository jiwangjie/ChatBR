", "OB": "But in fact BEFOREFIRSTROW only works when the cursor is just to enter the first row, and AFTERLASTROW only works when cursor is just to leave the last row. Once the iteration is finished, both type won't work anymore. A \"QueryResults or its iterator has been closed\" DataException will be thrown out if you try to evaluate these expressions.But actually, these global expressions is nothing to do with the data row iteration. Also, current BEFOREFIRSTROW/AFTERLASTROW name is misleading, better change to ONSTARTROW, ONENDROW or others which are more clarified.This bug currently blocks chart to evaluate those nondatarow expressions(i.e. expressions from title url action) which are not within a datarow iteration(Chart need to evaluate these expreesions from action after data binding).
