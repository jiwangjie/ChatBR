So you can construct an expression like this:row[\"FIRSTNAME\"] + \" \" + row[\"LASTNAME\"] + \" / \" + row[\"OFFICECODE\"]However this report will not run. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on \"COUNTRY\" is to insertrows[0][\"COUNTRY\"]into the expression.The first index (an integer) to the \"rows\" array is the 0based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table etc.). ", "OB": "It runs fine.Now imagine that the designer wants to append a country name suffix to each employee name (e.g., \"Diane Merphy / USA\"). An expression row[\"COUNTRY\"] is added to the expression text. The problem is that row[\"OFFICECODE\"] is not valid in the inner table. In order for the inner table to access the outer table's columns, the expression needs to use the \"rows\" object. ", "EB": "The report designer should figure out the correct index number by looking at the nesting levels of all tables. ", "SR": "Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). To do this double click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression. Click on \"Available Data Sets\", choose data set \"offices\", then double click on column \"COUNTRY\". "}
