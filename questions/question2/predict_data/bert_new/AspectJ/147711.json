The JAXB 2 solution to ignore such fields is to annotate them with @XmlTransient, but since the field does not exist in the user program they can't even do this! ", "OB": "In a number of cases tools are getting confused over generated aj members that are\"ajsynthetic\" but not marked with the synthetic attribute (because in the past, this has upset other tools). The most recent example was a JAXB posting on the listby having a perthis() clause in an aspect that matched a type with JAXB 2 annotations the user was no longer able to use JAXB.
