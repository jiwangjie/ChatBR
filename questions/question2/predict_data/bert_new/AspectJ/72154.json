", "OB": "", "EB": "When the compiler terminates abnormally (exception) or behaves unexpectedly(warning/error/abort) a simple dump of the compiler state should be producedto aid problem diagnosis. The content and conditions under which the dump isproduced should be configurable by the user but the facility should be enabledby default for exceptions. Consequently its inclusion should have negligibleimpact on compiler performance and footprint. The file should be attached tobug reports to give a complete and objective description of the user\u2019senvironment and support problem resolution where a testcase cannot be provided.One approach is to write a uniquely name file (using date & time) in thecurrent directory e.g \u201cajcore.20040818.105200.txt\u201d which should be humanreadable (it can be zipped if large) to allow the user to potentially diagnosetheir own problems or remove potentially sensitive data before submission.
