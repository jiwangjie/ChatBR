I thinkthat the latter is probably the best as BuildOption assumes a depedency onEclipse which shouldn't be there.We do currently have customer, one in nato, who are currently having towork around this issue so it would be good to get it resolve for 1.5.3 if possibleBut I know I am a bit late for that now do to a lost email. ", "OB": "Bug 164288Can no longer compile JDK 1.5 projects with apsectj for JDeveloper I am working with AspectJ 1.5.2 in JDeveloper and have found that it isnot possible to convince the compiler to use JDK 5 constructs.It appears that there is a method on AjcBuildOptions calledgetJavaOptionsMap() which is currently implemented to return null in allcases. Since the return value is always null the project isnever properly configured.I notice that the only other implementation of the root interface isCoreBuildOption which appears to directly return a structure from theeclipse class JavaProject. ", "EB": "It would appear that this interface isbreaking the rules on abstraction, is this the correct read on thesituation?If so the solution would either be to implement a CoreBuildOption classto correctly work with the ADJE project adapter class or alter the code inCompiler adapter to correct use the properties in project adapter.
