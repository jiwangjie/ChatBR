{"id": "386049", "title": "Bug 386049Error \"must implement abstract intertype declaration\" even though build is fine", "description": "Bug 386049Error \"must implement abstract intertype declaration\" even though build is fine But as I said, the code runs just fine.Please note: The funny thing is that in those two classes I just need to add and remove whitespace, then save the file, and the error goes away file by file. As soon as I rebuild though, the errors are there again.Please also note: The errors always are shown for subclasses XOMUnclutterFilter and JTidyFilter, but strangely not for subclass PreJTidyFilter, even though it is affected by the same pointcut and advice as the others and also subclassing the same base class.Reproducible: AlwaysSteps to Reproduce:I do not know if there is a way for you to reproduce this behaviour with the little code snippets I provided above, but here it happens all the time.If you would like to clone my project, it is located at https://github.com/kriegaex/GalileoOpenbookCleaner.My Eclipse was configured via Yoxos, but AJDTVersion: 2.2.0.e42xRELEASE201207032200AspectJ version: 1.7.0.20120703164200was installed by me manually because right after the Juno release AJDT were not available via Yoxos yet (I do not know if they are now). ", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "Build Identifier: Version: 4.2.0 Build id: I201206081400I have an AspectJ project with Java classes like this (schematically, not the full code):public abstract class BasicFilter {protected abstract String getLogMessage();}public class PreJTidyFilter extends BasicFilter{@Overrideprotected String getLogMessage() {return \"Fixing HTML so as to enable JTidy to parse it\";}}public class JTidyFilter extends BasicFilter {@Overrideprotected String getLogMessage() {return \"Converting to clean, prettyprinted XHTML\";}}public class XOMUnclutterFilter extends BasicFilter {@Overrideprotected String getLogMessage() {return \"Removing clutter (header, footer, navigation, ads) and fixing structure\";}}I also have this aspect:privileged aspect LoggingAspect {pointcut runFilter() : execution( BasicFilter.run());void around(BasicFilter filter) : runFilter() && this(filter) {String message = filter.getLogMessage();SimpleLogger.verbose(message, IndentMode.INDENTAFTER);proceed(filter);SimpleLogger.dedent();}}The aspects compile and run fine, but the Eclipse error view always shows two errors:must implement abstract intertype declaration:java.lang.String de.scrummaster.galileo.filter.BasicFilter.getLogMessage()(XOMUnclutterFilter.java)must implement abstract intertype declaration:java.lang.String de.scrummaster.galileo.filter.BasicFilter.getLogMessage()(JTidyFilter.java)The errors even reoccur after cleaning and rebuilding the project.
