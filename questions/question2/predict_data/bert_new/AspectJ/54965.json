Itraced it through, and found that every source file passed to an incrementalcompile is in fact compiled twice!The first time round we note the references, and of course each file has areference to itself. This method doesnot remember the set of files it just compiled, so since we have referenced eachtype we just compiled, and we have no reord of that fact, we compile them again.Second time around, the bytecodes are identical to the previous go, sorecordClassFile doesn't note their dependentsand thus this time we terminate.
