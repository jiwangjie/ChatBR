", "EB": "It would be nice to have a capability toeither mark individual Java file(s), or packages or parts of the sourcetree tomean \"do not compile and/or report errors\".Alternatively, filtering of thetask view could be enhanced to ignore errors from multiple unrelated Java file(s), or packages (currently, the choice is limited to either the selectedresource or ALL errors from the selected project).In a discussion about this on the Eclipse newsgroup, it was mentioned that thesource could be partitioned in a different way to allow current Exlipsefunctionality to do the filtering.But, in cases where the source tree alreadyexists in a large (open source, say) project, such reorganization is often notpossible.Another workaround mentioned was to root each part of the sourcetree individually, which might work in certain cases, but quickly becomestedious as the number of branches of the src tree increases.
