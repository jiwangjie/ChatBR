I know about this one. ", "OB": "EC post \"Navigator rename: cut/copy/paste/undo control keys broken\" by RM on Aug 30, 2001.Looks like the control keys don't work in the Navigator. Nothing happensNow undock the Navigator and try scenario again. It works!NOTES:NE (8/31/01 12:12:56 PM)When docked, the controlkeys are probably being stolen by the accelerators in the edit menu (or other menus),which are directed to the current view (the navigator in this case), not the edit field for the rename.When undocked, these aren't there, so the key goes to the edit field.Thanks for pointing out the distinction.I've filed a PR for this:1GJBZ7S: ITPUI:WIN2000EC: Control keys not handled by inplace renameKH (9/19/2001 12:01:08 PM)Pls find me.
