{"id": "7017", "title": "Bug 7017New project location dialog misleading", "description": "There have been many reports of people creating new projects and specifying nondefault content locations getting confused and specifying the parent of thelocation rather than the location itself.For example, a typical user wantingto create a project Foo and have it actually live in c:\\projects\\foo, willuncheck the \"use default location\" box and then use the Browse button to getselect a location.They will then navigate as far as they can (i.e., to thec:\\projects dir) and say ok.On returning to the main dialog they see theselected location in the location text field and click ok.Unfortunately, this did not create Foo in c:\\projects\\Foo as theyexpect/figured.It created Foo but Foo's content area is c:\\projects.Ofcourse, they then try to delete the project and delete much more than theyexpected...The file browser presented when using the Browse... button is less thanoptimal.It does not allow users to create new folders.In this scenario theuser is not presented with any alternative so the naturally figure that Eclipsewill do the right thing for them and append on the project name.In addition, different wording in the dialog may help.For example, ratherthan talking of \"Content location\", perhaps using \"Project root\" or some suchwould be more specific that this is the root of the project not the parent ofthe root.Another alternative is to automatically append the name of the project on theend of the path selected using the Browse... option.While this may not be theactual correct string in all cases, it will be correct in many cases and itdoes drive home to the user that the location path is the FULL path to the rootof the project not the parent of the root.
