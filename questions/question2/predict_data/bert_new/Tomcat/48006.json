", "OB": "Optionally, thesupplementary information of the container and the underlying Java platform canbe added after the implementation type within parentheses. ", "EB": "The field value should consist of one ormore implementation types, such as \"Servlet/2.4\". The container shouldbe configurable to suppress this header.Here\u2019s the examples of this header.XPoweredBy: Servlet/2.4XPoweredBy: Servlet/2.4 JSP/2.0 (Tomcat/5.0 JRE/1.4.1)...This behavior is not implemented in Tomcat 6.0.20.To make it totally clear, may I suggest to return the precise Tomcat and JVM version with all the digits and the vendor such as Tomcat/5.5.28 JRE/SUN/1.5.012b04)Having this headers helps a lot the development team to determine what is really running his application in test or production w/o asking to the maintenance guy who is either often unreachable or not able to answer (YES).Provide the option to remove the header through the configuration (file) or through programming (see related bugs 48004 and 48005).The servlet 3.0 specification athttp://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr315/index.htmlin the same section \"SRV.5.2 Headers\" says the same but I did not test for it in Tomcat 7.ThanksOlivier ", "SR": ""}
