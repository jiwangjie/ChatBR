", "OB": "When session is stored in StandardManagerdoUnload method,an invalid session is stored.For instance,If HttpSessioninvalidate is executed while executing StandardManagerdoUnload,session of \"isValid=false\" is stored.The session of isValid=false is restored in StandardManagerdoLoad,and it registers in session map (sessions).However, no one can invalidate this session.If isValid is false, StandardSessioninvalidate() and StandardSessionisValid() can not expire session.They are throws IllegalStateException or return immediately.Consequently, the session of isValid=false is never deleted from the session map(sessions).I made a patch.If session is already invalid, expire session to prevent memory leak.Best Regards.Keiichi.
