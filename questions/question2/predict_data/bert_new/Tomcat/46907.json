This consumes the HttpServletRequest input stream which then arrives unusable for the user at the beginning of the JSP code (usingHttpServletRequest.getInputStream(), the stream is already at its end).A workaround is to disable debug traces for Japser class in log4j.properties, but Jasper should not consume the HttpServletRequest input stream whatever mode it runs into.
