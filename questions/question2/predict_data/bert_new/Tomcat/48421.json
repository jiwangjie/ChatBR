{"id": "48421", "title": "Bug 48421JULI webapp logging files will not closed when webapp is stopped,reloaded or undeployed", "description": "Bug 48421JULI webapp logging files will not closed when webapp is stopped,reloaded or undeployed In Tomcat 6the JULI logging files which are (can be) declared in webapp/WEBINF/classes/logging.properties will not closed, when thewebapp is reloaded, stopped or even undeployed. The files will at last be closed, when tomcat is shut down or restarted.This is also true for the normally used Handler org.apache.juli.FileHandler, which opens a new File every day and closes the old.On windows this has following effects:A) Ifthe webapp is undeployed the files which are open at this moment are locked and cannot be deleted until tomcat is (someday) stopped or restarted.B) If the webapp is reloaded the file is opened a second time. But it is a bug because with this logging the same logfile can be useless multiple open (as described above), which should be considered as buggy. ", "OB": "So the file has two open handles.The next day the FileHandler closes one handle but the file is kept locked through the other handle and cannot be deleted.Every time a webapp is reloaded the associated logfile is opened again (but not closed).This has the consequence that after reloading webapps a few times tomcat must be restarted from time to time.When tomcat is shutdown the unnecessary (and other) open files are closed and will get the shutdown time as modification time.That means any old log files will receive a current modification time, which is irritating.Steps to verify on windows: (for example: undeploy)1. create in the examples webapp: of tomcat 6.0.20:examples/WEBINF/classes/logging.properties:handlers = org.apache.juli.FileHandlerorg.apache.juli.FileHandler.level = FINEorg.apache.juli.FileHandler.directory = ${catalina.base}/logsorg.apache.juli.FileHandler.prefix = servletexamples.2. undeploy examples using managerActual Results:file ${catalina.base}/logs/servletexamples.<date.log cannot be deleted (nor at the next day)Expected:file ${catalina.base}/logs/servletexamples.<date.log can be deletedvery cumbersome Workaround (working for reload):The getHead method of a custom Formatter is extended to track the handlers along with the classloader and webapp.If for a webapp a different (i.e. new) classloader is detected the close method of the handlers assigned to the old classloader is called. ", "EB": "", "SR": "start tomcat3. So the assigned file is proper closed (and the Formatter.getTail result is appended)I have set severity at minor because tomcat can be used (without webapp logging). "}
