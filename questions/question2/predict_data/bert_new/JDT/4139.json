One thing I miss though: code templates. userspecified shortcut key[s]? :shortcut (possible userdefined)i.e. did the U/I provide a list of them for you when you invoked it, or could you invoke each one with some separate key sequence? :you could start typing the template, then hit one special key for templatesand seethe list of available templates.Please: NO separate keys for different templates!are they just a macro? :?did you name them? :yes.did you fill in the parameter (i.e. [vector]) (in a dialog, perhaps? \"U/I place the cursor for you to type it in\" right after the template hasbeen injectedin your code. ", "OB": "", "EB": "I would like to haveuser defined shortcuts to generate statements like:for (int i=0; i<[vector].size(); i++) {Object item = [vector].get(i);}where [vector] would be replaced by a user supplied name.NOTES:CM (8/23/2001 3:57:39 PM)Further info on feature: It would be useful if you could supply more info:where have you used these before:JBuilderhow did you invoke themspecific shortcut key?
