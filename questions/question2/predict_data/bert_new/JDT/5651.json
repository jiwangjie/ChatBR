You will notice that Ihave to do a couple of extra steps to get rid of the 'src' folder. I would justlike to eliminate those extra steps. Here is the post:When I run Eclipse, I specify where I want my workspace to be, i.e.C:\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe data D:\\Eclipse\\targetSo, Eclipse stores all of my projects in D:\\Eclipse\\target, even thoughI am running it from C:\\eclipse.Of course, the .java and .class files are all mixed together, which I don'tlike, so when I create a Java project, I tell Eclipse to create 'src' and 'bin'folders. (WindowPreferencesJava\"Use 'src' and 'bin' folders asdefault in new Java projects. After this, I usually select \"Use the project as source folder\" in the\"Source\" tab (unless I want to have some other named source folders in theproject (not 'src' <g), in which case I just leave \"Use source folderscontained in the project\" selected).At this point, I am ready to start adding packages to my project.The compiler puts all of my .class files for the projet into the 'bin'directory in:D:\\Eclipse\\target\\MyProject\\bin ", "OB": "", "EB": "", "SR": "\")Now for one final step, which I do because I don't like the 'src' folder <grin: First, I delete the 'src' folder Then I modify the Properties of the Project (select project, context menu Properties) and I also delete the 'src' folder from the Java Build Path \"Source\" tab.
