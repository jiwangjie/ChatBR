", "EB": "It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point tothe whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to thebuild path.This would be analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher you can specify the system property java.ext.dirs to point to a list ofdirectories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath.This feature suggested itself to me after using a class contained in theWebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0). ", "SR": "When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have tospecify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the samedirectory. In order to get my code tocompile, I had to add in several of the jar files from the WTE plugin directory.This involved manually searching through the jar files to find the missingclasses, and adding in the appropriate jars.I believe bug 3887 alludes to this feature (saying it will be deferred), but Ihaven't been able to find a bug report or feature request directly describingthis.
