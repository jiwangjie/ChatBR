The converterin the String class is the standard converter which is setwith 'fileconverter=utf8'. Since these are external codewe're not able to change them and set encoding back toLatin1.The question is:The Photon port of the AWT/SWT must use UTF8 for displayingText in Photon. Why is the converter that is dependanton the 'fileconverter' parameter? ", "OB": "The cause forthat is, that for the AWT/SWT character conversion theClass org.eclipse.swt.internal.Converter is used whichuses the converters of the String class. This is showing all Umlautscorrectly in the UI but all I/O interfaces are usingthis conversion as well. The OTI implementationis marked as 'SLOW AND BOGUS' when will that be changed?
