It has the required methods to implement:public void treeExpanded(TreeExpansionEvent event), andpublic void treeCollapsed(TreeExpansionEvent event).The problem is that when an item in the tree is expanded for the first timeonly, treeExpanded(TreeExpansionEvent) is called twice.treeCollapsed is only called once, as expected, and treeExpanded is only calledone upon subsequent expansions of tree items.
