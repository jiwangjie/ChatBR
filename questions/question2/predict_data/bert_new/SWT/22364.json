Of course the height can be adjusted by using a GridLayoutin the enclosing composite and by defining a heightHint, but I believe thedefault height should allow to fully see the text in the TextViewer widget.The problem appears when running under Linux RedHat 7.3 with Eclipse R2.0gtk2.The same code runs ok on a Windows 2000 machine, with Eclipse R2.0.I am separately attaching a little plugin project that demonstrates theproblem. The plugin is a stripped down version of your Sample Plugin with aView, where I have placed two components in the sample view, the first onebeing a TextViewer and the second one a simple text. ", "OB": "However they arealways rendered with a height that is insufficient to show the complete stringtext inside their widget, with the result that the text is partially choppedoff and unreadable. Resizing of the window that contains the TextViewers doesnot have any effect. Under Windows 2000 all iswell, but under Linux the TextViewer's height is insufficient. ", "EB": "", "SR": "In a plugin I use TextViewers with style SWT.SINGLE | SWT.BORDER. To run the test,simply import the plugin, compile it, run as Runtime Workbench and open theSample View (under the Sample Category category).Thanks. "}
