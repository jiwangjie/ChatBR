When you type in the \"Find\" or \"Replace With\" fields itsearches for entries from a previous search. If it finds one, it replaces whatyou have typed with the value from the history. The search of the history iscase insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may bechanged to the case of the value in the history.In some scenarios this makes it impossible to perform find or replaceoperations.

But this should still respect the case of what theuser types. Until then, I think the feature should be removed.To reproduce: Open a document so that EditFind/Replace... becomes available.
