Data represented in a different codepage would be lost.In addition, the RTF spec mandates escaping non 7bit characters using \\'hhwhere hh is the hex value. Notehowever that all Windows applications we tested seemed to tolerate the nonescaped 8 bit form for transfering Hebrew text.In order to support text in more than one locale we would need to encode thetext using RTF unicode escapes (\\ud..d where d is the decimal value of theunicode character).
