{"bug_id": "23935", "title": "Bug 23935Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus", "description": "build 20020920Run the attached code.The left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux. When youclick anywhere in the tree the tree gets focus. Both widgets are children ofthe shell.The right tree and text only work on Windows. On Linux the text never losesfocus when you click on the tree. The text widget is a child of the tree.This causes platform UI bug 2470. We can probably work around by creating thetext editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree."}
