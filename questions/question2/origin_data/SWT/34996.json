{"bug_id": "34996", "title": "Bug 34996Tab Event weirdly handled in motif", "description": "This is similar to bug 33495 except it occurs on motif and the symptoms aredifferent. The problem is that if the user assigns a command to the Tab key onmotif, the action is performed, but focus transfers to the buttons in the toolbar.To reproduce:1) Get Eclipse for Linux/Motif/RC22) Unzip and run it (with a fresh workspace)3) Open the Keys preference page4) Set (for example) the Line Down action to Global scope, Standard config, andKey seq 'Tab'5) Open up a new project (call it test) and a new file (call it test.txt)6) Press enter, followed by up arrow in the new file7) Press the 'Tab' button8) Notice how focus transfers to the first button in the toolbar.9) Press the 'Tab' button a few more times10) Notice how focus transfers along the toolbar and eventually returns to theeditor11) Notice how once focus is transferred back to the editor the cursor is on thenext line.This occurs for me on debian/unstable and was discovered due to a userattempting to use the TabNavigator plugin from zclipse.org."}
