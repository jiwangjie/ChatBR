{"bug_id": "11994", "title": "Bug 11994StyledText  replace getXAtOffset(caretOffset) with caret.getLocation().x", "description": "build 20020319In a number of places we get the location of the caret by calling getXAtOffset(caretOffset).I haven't looked at the code but we may be able to replace this with a call tocaret.getLocation().x. This won't be possible though if the caret is null(i.e., when there is no caret). We could at least optimize the case when thereis a caret."}
