{"bug_id": "25162", "title": "Bug 25162GTK: Marking text using the mouse", "description": "I found this bug using the M1 and M2 releases of Eclipse for LinuxGTK. The bugis not present in the 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 releases.When selecting text (marked in blue) in an editor using the mouse, and\"dragging\" the mouse to select text which is not currently visible (i.e. singleleft clicking at some point in the visible text and then dragging the mousebelow the editor view), Eclipse stops responding. If I then try to stop Eclipse,the OS tells me that: 'The Window \"Java Browsing  Eclipse Platform\" is notresponding' and I then has to kill Eclipse. Doing this, Eclipse reports thefollowing error (and exits):JVM terminated. Exit code=1/coll/local/bin/javacp /products/eclipse2.1M2/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Mainos linuxws gtkarch x86showsplash /products/eclipse2.1M2/eclipse showsplash 600data /home/cnc/eclipseprojectsIf I instead selects the text using the keyboard it works fine."}
