(Lucida Grande being the standard OS X fontfor menus and such)if you run the test case with all three .setText calls, you will notice that the 'cloverleaf' symbol is nolonger displayed correctly.it seems that the .setText call with the empty string argument does something bad to the font.this problem is severe for our key sequence entry widget. marking as critical for M4."}
