{"bug_id": "27869", "title": "Bug 27869StyledText overuse of Font.getFontData", "description": "Running eclipse, using the Java Editor: A single key stroke can cause the APIFont.getFontData() to be called 13 times. I believe, and many people agree,that this API don't need to be used at all by the StyledText when it's beentyped. This API is also overused when we are scrolling the StyledText andselecting text. Try to add system.out.println in the first line of methodFontgetFontData, run a selfhosted eclipse, watch the console.I concerned about this problem cause in some platform the performance of thismethod is very pour if compared with Windows.For example, Motif running on UTF8. Each Font has 7 FontData, therefore everytime I type 'a' in the JavaEditor 91 (713) FontData will be loaded. Btw, UTF8is the default english encoding for Redhat 8.FontMetrics API is also very used by the StyledText, I believe that the metricinformation should be cached in the StyledText and update only when the font ischanged."}
