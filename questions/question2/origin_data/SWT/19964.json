{"bug_id": "19964", "title": "Bug 19964Coolbar  can \"lose\" items when platform widget wraps", "description": "Build 200206111. Size the workbench and Reset Toolbar Layout so that you have two rows ofitems, with only a couple of items on the second row.2. Size the workbench smaller and smaller vertically.When the items on thefirst row can no longer fit (due to minimum size reached for all), the platformwidget will start to wrap items from row 1 to row 2.Notice that you \"lose\" the original second row items.The WorkbenchWindowLayout is being called during the resize and the size of thecoolbar recomputed, so this appears to be an SWT bug.If you Reset ToolbarLayout, the problem will be fixed, but that is because wrap indices areexplicitly being set."}
