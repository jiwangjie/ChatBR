{"bug_id": "37591", "title": "Bug 37591ImageLoader.save for GIF saves in compress GIF format", "description": "We are using the ImageLoader class successfully to export Image to thefilesystem.private void saveImageToGif(Image image, String destination) { ImageData imageData = image.getImageData(); ImageLoader imageLoader = new ImageLoader(); imageLoader.data = new ImageData[] { imageData }; imageLoader.logicalScreenHeight = image.getBounds().width; imageLoader.logicalScreenHeight = image.getBounds().height; imageLoader.save(destination, SWT.IMAGEGIF);}There is an issue however that the GIF image produced is in compressed format.The problem is that the default for Windows is to use Microsoft WindowsPicture and Fax Viewer when opening GIF files from the filesystem.This viewer does not support compressed GIF files.As a workaround for our users, you can right click on the GIF file and do OpenWith. If you open with Microsoft Photo Editor or Microsoft Internet Explorer,the GIF file is fine.However, we would rather have the option added to image loader to produce animage in non compressed format.This issue is discussed inhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;enus;326675"}
