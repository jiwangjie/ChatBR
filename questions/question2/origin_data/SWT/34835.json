{"bug_id": "34835", "title": "Bug 34835Widget \"default\" styles should be reflected in style bits", "description": "RC2There are various cases, easily shown in the ControlExample, of widgets takingon a \"default\" style even though an explicit style bit is not provided.Forexample, a Label of type SWT.SEPARATOR defaults to be vertical unlessSWT.HORIZONTAL is explicitly specified.This is fine, but consequentlyinvoking Label.getStyle() answers a style that does not contain theSWT.VERTICAL bit since it was not explicitly specified at creation time.The checkStyle() methods on a few widgets need to be extended to ensurethat \"default\" styles get added in to specified styles whenever \"default\"styles are to be used."}
