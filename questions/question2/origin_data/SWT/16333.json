{"bug_id": "16333", "title": "Bug 16333accessibility tab key in dialog boxes", "description": "Windows standard is that tab and shift+tab keys within a dialog box move thefocus to the next previous control even if the control is in the same group.But in eclipse if there are several controls in the same tab group one isforced to use arrows keys to switch focus among them;Users of accessibility devices such as screen readers are not used to thisbehaviour which, if not known, could make them to ignore the existence ofcontrols in a dialog box because they are completely skipped tabbing around.So I propose that tab and shift+tab move focus even to controls belonging tothe same group."}
