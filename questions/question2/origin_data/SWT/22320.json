Press the Delete/Add button multiple times.This removes the second item,then adds it back.Notice that the item is not added back in its original spotand keeps sliding over as you press the Delete/Add button.On Windows, this behavior does not occur.On Linux, when the item is deletedthe space that it occuppied is added to the first item, so adding the item backat its original spot doesn't work as expected.The emulated behavior should belike the Windows behavior."}
