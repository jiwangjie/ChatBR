The drag icon appears,but there is no drop location feedback.NavigatorDragAdapter.dragStart checks whether the drag source actually hasfocus. Display.getFocusControl returns null even though the tree viewer doeshave focus. When I comment out this check and dragStart lets the drop operationcontinue the drop adapter still does not get a dragEnter event.Package view DND no longer works either.Did SWT change anything wrt. Motif DND that could have broken this?"}
