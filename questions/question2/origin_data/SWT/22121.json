I did the following:a) Rightclick on link in MSIE, select \"Copy shortcut\". The link I got was thefollowing: http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/bycodes.htmlU000A9b) Paste it in notepad, just to check that it was copied OK.c) Paste it in Eclipse, in the middle of a Java source code file, for furtherediting (actually, it's the unicode for the (C) symbol that I wanted...) Morespecifically, I pasted it after the first opening { on a class definition,before the first instance variable declaration.d) BANG! Eclipse dies with a \"JVM error 10473247932489324\" or something likethat.e) On restart, I get the following message in the log file. Don't know ifthat's really related to the problem, or more to problems during restart.!SESSION aug 02, 2002 11:26:59.640 java.version=1.4.001java.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc.BootLoader constants: OS=win32, ARCH=x86, WS=win32, NL=svSECommandline arguments: os win32 ws win32 arch x86 data C:\\Workspace install file:F:/Program Files/eclipse/!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 aug 02, 2002 11:26:59.650!MESSAGE Unable to restore editor  createElement returned null for inputelement factory: org.eclipse.ui.part.FileEditorInputFactory!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 aug 02, 2002 11:26:59.660!MESSAGE Unable to restore editor  createElement returned null for inputelement factory: org.eclipse.ui.part.FileEditorInputFactory!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 aug 02, 2002 11:27:05.438!MESSAGE Unable to restore editor  createElement returned null for inputelement factory: org.eclipse.ui.part.FileEditorInputFactory!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 aug 02, 2002 11:27:05.448!MESSAGE Unable to restore editor  createElement returned null for inputelement factory: org.eclipse.ui.part.FileEditorInputFactory!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 aug 02, 2002 11:27:05.468!MESSAGE Unable to restore editor  createElement returned null for inputelement factory: org.eclipse.ui.part.FileEditorInputFactory!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 aug 02, 2002 11:27:05.478!MESSAGE Unable to restore editor  createElement returned null for inputelement factory: org.eclipse.ui.part.FileEditorInputFactory!ENTRY com.rational.clearcase 1 0 aug 02, 2002 11:27:07.802!MESSAGE traceLevel = 2(option=null)"}
