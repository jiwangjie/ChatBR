{"bug_id": "11515", "title": "Bug 11515computeTrim and getClientArea are inconsistent in CTabFolder", "description": "According to SWT documentation, given a desired client area, computeTrim shouldreturn a bounding rectangle required to produce that client area. Boundingrectangle height taken into account in CTabFolder.getClientArea (line 613) isgreater one row of pixels than the one calculated in CTabFolder.computeTrim(line 348). This is inconsistent. It also affects the patch to fix 10025. Theworkaround is to manually correct the bounds returned by computeTrim."}
