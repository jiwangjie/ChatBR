{"bug_id": "38161", "title": "Bug 38161MessageDialog does not accept null shell", "description": "2.1The Javadoc for MessageDialog's constructors states:Note: Currently, null can be passed in for the parent....However, this is no longer the case.In 2.1, trying this results in an NPE.I actually wanted this since I need to bring up a dialog on startup to notifythe user of a workspace version incompatibility.There are no other shellsaround at this point (or even a display).Now I have to create a bogus shell just to avoid the NPE."}
