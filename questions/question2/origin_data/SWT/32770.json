{"bug_id": "32770", "title": "Bug 32770Java application launch shortcut error doesn't help user", "description": "1. Open a java file containing a main method.2. Select a nonresourcebased view (such as the Debug view).3. Click Debug AsJava Application.4. A dialog appears: \"Launch failed: no main type found\".We should consider tracking resource selection the way external tools tracksselection for variable expansion (in fact, we should be able to combine thetwo into a single mechanism?). Also, we should improve the quality of theerror message. The message should give the user a hint about what they needto do to fix the problem  in this case, they need to select a resource.The message should say something like \"Launch failed: No file with a maintype selected\""}
