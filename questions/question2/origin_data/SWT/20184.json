{"bug_id": "20184", "title": "Bug 20184Color javadoc could use reference to Device.getSystemColor()", "description": "It would be nice if the class description for the Color class would have a @seetag pointing the developer to Display.getSystemColor().Most of the time I amcreating \"primary colors\", and I never remember where to find them.I preferto use the Display method since I don't have to dispose of the color, and itwould be helpful if the Color class doc suggested this usage."}
