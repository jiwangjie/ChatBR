{"bug_id": "30905", "title": "Bug 30905Add Menu.setRedraw(boolean) API", "description": "On windows, when the workbench removes a number of menu item and adds a numberof menu item, it causes the menu bar to flash a lot. I hack the Menu class tohave a setRedraw(boolean) method, and by doing so, it eliminated the flash wewere seeing.Is it possible to have this API? It is important to overall feel of theworkbench. Can this be fixed for 2.1?"}
