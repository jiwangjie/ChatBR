{"bug_id": "45145", "title": "Bug 45145Second window comes to front when using first", "description": "I use two Eclipse windows. If I switch in from another application to one Eclipse window, and thenclick on a docked view, or perspective, the other window comes to the front over my otherapplications' windows. Unless I click on the Eclipse dock icon, the only time a window should cometo the front is if I click on it explicitly (or some behavior takes me to a widget in the other window)."}
