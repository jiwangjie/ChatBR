{"bug_id": "32122", "title": "Bug 32122Cannot insert lines into new file code template (regression failure)", "description": "I can edit the templates for new Java files (Java  Code Generation  Code and Comments  Code  New Java Files) but I cannot insert a new blank line. Whilst I am editing, the [OK] button is still highlighted with the result that when I press return, the [OK] button is pressed and no new line appears.I believe that this functionality has been broken in M4M5, since in M4 the default [OK] button did not respond to return characters."}
