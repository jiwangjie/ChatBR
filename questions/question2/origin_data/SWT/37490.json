{"bug_id": "37490", "title": "Bug 37490BIDI: text in the rtloriented Text control can't be aligned to the trailing edge of this control.", "description": "SWT, as usually, uses for creating of it's Text control CreateWindowEx() nativecall with WSEXLAYOUTRTL extended window's style. In spite of this,corresponding native Edit control is created as not mirrored window withWSEXRIGHT, WSEXLEFTSCROLLBAR and WSEXRTLREADING extended styles andESRIGHT alignment style. Therefore contents of rtloriented Text control can'tbe aligned to it's trailing edge.We suggest to use WSEXRTLREADING and WSEXLEFTSCROLLBAR instead ofWSEXLAYOUTRTL extended style. Using of alignment styles will depend oncurrent orientation of Text control."}
