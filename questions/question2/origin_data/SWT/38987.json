{"bug_id": "38987", "title": "Bug 38987PocketPC: MULTI Text control ESWANTRETURN/TABNEXT problem", "description": "PocketPC: MULTI Text control ESWANTRETURN/TABNEXT problemOn PocketPC, when having a MULTI Text control with or without scrollbars,with or without wrap, etc.  you cannot make it accept plain [Enter] keyto break lines. Only Ctrl+Enter (Ctrl+M, Ctrl+J) would work.What helps is an internal OS hack:int oldBits = OS.GetWindowLong (text.handle, OS.GWLSTYLE);int newBits = oldBits | 0x1000; // ESWANTRETURNOS.SetWindowLong (text.handle, OS.GWLSTYLE, newBits);Similar situation with the TAB key: we want it act regularly by insertinga TAB character into the text. But there is no \"WANTTAB\" flag.There is this Traverse functionality by adding a listener and in thehandler to set the doit field for the event. However, in PocketPC,neither 'false' or 'true' has any effect on reviving the TAB(or ENTER).So the only solution for TAB is in the same Traverse handler toText.insert() the character manually. This is a workaround andit behaves differently on the Desktop, however it should be consistent.These problems with NOT getting either LF or TAB characterdo not appear on desktop SWT. So this may be just a bug in PocketPC."}
