{"bug_id": "24877", "title": "Bug 24877Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog", "description": "There's no way to get the file extension that the user selected from theFileDialog. It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine thecorrect file extension to append to the file name. We need an api for the filedialog to return the \"Save as type\" field that the user selected in theFileDialog.Athough we are using this dialog in our own product, this problem can beillustrated when you export to a jar file. Select .zip in the \"Save as type\"and enter a file name (eg. test). The export wizard should use thefile \"test.zip\" when this happens.STEPS:1) Select a java file2) Select FileExport...3) Select JAR file and press Next4) Press Browse... to select a Save As file dialog5) Enter test for the file name6) Select .zip for the \"Save as type\" field7) Press SaveResult:The JAR export wizard uses \"test\" for the JAR file field.Expected result:The JAR export wizard should use the \"test.zip\" for the JAR file field."}
