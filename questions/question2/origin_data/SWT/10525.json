{"bug_id": "10525", "title": "Bug 10525'Free' TableViewer column cannot be edited", "description": "When a TableViewer instance is created, one column is created for free if noneis specified. This works well and handles the resizing of the table, but thecode in 'activateCellEditor' ignores it when there are no explicitly createdcolumns.Please give me a heads up when the fix is released so that I can test my codebefore the integration build. Otherwise, all PDE editors will be broken (cannotrename entries in lists)."}
