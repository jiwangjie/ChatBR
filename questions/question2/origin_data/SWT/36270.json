Only some current widget's specific styles remainafter this filtering. One more widget, TableTree, doesn't work with assignedstyles (only send them to Table, which is internaly used). In allcases \"orientation\" styles are removed before creating handle of widget,therefore these widgets can't be created with explicitly assigned orientationand only can inherit orientation from their parents."}
