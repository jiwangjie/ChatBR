{"bug_id": "23657", "title": "Bug 23657Problems implementing MenuItem.setText (worked around for English)", "description": "On the Mac the menu accelerator text isn't specified as a string but via a bitset similar toSWT's accelerator used in MenuItem.setAccelerator. In addition the accelerator's string isset as a side effect of setting the accelerator itself. So they are always in synch.Therefore in the SWT Mac port I was ignoring the accelerator part of the string given toMenuItem.setText(...) and I was using the bitset from MenuItem.setAccelerator(). I wasrelying on the assumption that both should be in synch. However this assumption is nowbroken. MenuItems on which an accelerator string has been set with setTexttypicallyhave the accelerator 0, other menu items where the accelerator is not 0 have noaccelerator string set.For the Mac port this means I have to parse the string given to MenuItem.setText.However, since the string is already localized parsing isn't feasible.How can I solve this dilemma?BTW: why are SWT's clients allowed to play dirty tricks with accelerators? I'm not surethat I can get accelerators to work on MacOS X (without introducing wads of bogus code)."}
