{"bug_id": "19671", "title": "Bug 19671Unable to expand/collapse trees in properties view", "description": "Build 20020607Redhat 7.2, KDE 2.210GTK2 Import a plugin, such as ..core.boot Open the Properties view Highlight the plugin so you can see the properties Try to collapse the tree by clicking on the '' boxIt doesn't do anything. In fact, it is impossible to expand or collapse anytree node from the properties view in GTK2 (as far as I can see). To see a treewith more nodes and levels, follow these steps.. Install the examples Create a file called 'test.usr' Open the properties view Click on 'richard' in the outline viewYou'll see a tree with '+' and '' boxes visible but nothing happens when youtry to expand/collapse them.NOTE: You'll also notice that the children of a node aren't indented at all. Ontop of this, when you click on a child that doesn't have children (no '+' or ''), it sometimes scrolls the view such that the selected field appears at thetop of the view, if your view is small enough vertically. And finally, if youhave properties that you can edit (such as the \"test.usr\" one) and you shrinkyour view vertically enough to show vertical scrollbars, then when you clickon, say, a text field to edit it, the editable box that comes up is on top ofthe scrollbar.McQ: Should I file each of these as individual PRs? Some of these look related."}
