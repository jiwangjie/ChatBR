{"bug_id": "11182", "title": "Bug 11182Property Sheet does not allow editing when there is only one property", "description": "Scenario:1) Create a PDE plugin project.2) Switch to 'Extensions' page.3) Create a new 'Action Set' extension.4) Select the extension and create new menu.5) Select the menu and create a new separator.6) Select the separator and try to change its default name.Property sheet refuses to allow editing of the name. All other objects thathave more than one property can be edited as before.This is a major problem for PDE because it makes the manifest editor uselessfor all the extension elements that have only one property."}
