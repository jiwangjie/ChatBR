{"bug_id": "39107", "title": "Bug 39107Up and Down keys not always work for Combo", "description": "It occurs only on GTK. After creating a read only combo, and add to it severalvalues, by pressing the up / down keys, the value of the combo changes. Thisworks almost fine with two problems, the first value of the combo and the lastvalue of the combo. When i reach to the first value and press the up key, thefocus is lost, and pressing either up or down key won't release me from thisstate, only using the mouse will do the work here. Same for the last value, butwith pressing the down key."}
