{"bug_id": "21374", "title": "Bug 21374Problem with Umlauts in Photon", "description": "We've got problems wuth Umlauts in our UI. The cause forthat is, that for the AWT/SWT character conversion theClass org.eclipse.swt.internal.Converter is used whichuses the converters of the String class. The converterin the String class is the standard converter which is setwith 'fileconverter=utf8'. This is showing all Umlautscorrectly in the UI but all I/O interfaces are usingthis conversion as well. Since these are external codewe're not able to change them and set encoding back toLatin1.The question is:The Photon port of the AWT/SWT must use UTF8 for displayingText in Photon. Why is the converter that is dependanton the 'fileconverter' parameter? The OTI implementationis marked as 'SLOW AND BOGUS' when will that be changed?"}
