{"bug_id": "20159", "title": "Bug 20159Rightclicking on coolbar grabber causes strange behavior", "description": "Build F3 (20020612)Redhat 7.2, KDE 2.210(Both Motif and GTK2)If you right click and release on a coolbar grabber (like a regular mouseclick), then the 4way arrow cursor appears (as if to say, you may now move thecoolbar). The coolbar will follow the mouse from now on, but only if you goreally slow, if you slide too fast then the coolbar stops following (but the 4way arrow is still there). If you move on the grabber again then it startsfollowing the mouse again.Also, after right clicking on a grabber, if you move your mouse under thecoolbar and then back up on a different grabber, then the coolbar jumps. Youcan even lock the coolbars and the 4way arrow is still present. The only wayto get out of the 4way arrow cursor mode is to left click on the originalgrabber."}
