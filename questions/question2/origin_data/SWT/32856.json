{"bug_id": "32856", "title": "Bug 32856[Cell Editors] Can not see what value I am typing in the Properties", "description": "The \"Value\" field in property sheets does not scroll properly when entering avalue longer than the column size.It does scroll but it's behind, e.g. if Itype \"org.eclipse.longtestcase.abcd\", after I type \"d\" it may only scroll upto \"a\"  so I don't see what I am typing.This happens on WinXP, but on GTK it scrolls correctly."}
