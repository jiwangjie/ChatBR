With SWT.SIMPLE selected, try to select SWT.READONLY or SWT.BORDER.3. The checkboxes appear enabled but clicking in them only causes them toflash.4. Select SWT.DROPDOWN and repeat step 2.5. Now SWT.READONLY can be selected, but SWT.BORDER still cannot.The checkboxes should appear disabled when they're not applicable. Also, ifthe SWT.BORDER style is never usable it probably shouldn't appear in the tab?"}
