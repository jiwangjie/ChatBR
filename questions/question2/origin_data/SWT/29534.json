{"bug_id": "29534", "title": "Bug 29534Override default behavior of 'F10' key", "description": "I'm writing a terminal emulation application that emulates terminals where thefunctions keys are valid key strokes, including 'F10'.I need to be able tooverride the default behavior of the 'F10' key to have terminal applications runproperly.As for the special key sequences (Ctrl + Esc), the default behaviordoes not need to be overridden because they are not valid user inputs on a terminal.Attached is a previous discussion with Steve Northover: I agree you have the case where you need to see F10.Please enter abugzilla report describing your case to avoid me telling you later thatyou don't really need to do this.The problem I see is that there are all kinds of special key sequences onthe various platforms that do magic things.We might be able to workaround F10 on Windows but what about Ctrl+Esc?The list goes on, canchange between operating system releases and is not well documented. Let'scontinue the discussion in the bug report.Please paste in this text.Thanks."}
