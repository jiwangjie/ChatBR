{"bug_id": "37519", "title": "Bug 37519Bug in Decorations.setPlacement method", "description": "The setPlacement method in Decorations contains the following code:if ((flags & OS.SWPNOMOVE) == 0) {lpwndpl.left = x;lpwndpl.top = y;}if ((flags & OS.SWPNOSIZE) == 0){lpwndpl.right = x + width;lpwndpl.bottom = x + height;}I believe this should be changed to:if ((flags & OS.SWPNOMOVE) == 0){lpwndpl.left = x;lpwndpl.top = y;}else{x = lpwndpl.left;y = lpwndpl.top;}if ((flags & OS.SWPNOSIZE) == 0){lpwndpl.right = x + width;lpwndpl.bottom = y + height;}The problem with the current code occurs when the 1st test is false (ie.NOMOVE is true) and the 2nd test is true (ie NOSIZE is false). Consider whathappens if setPlacement is called with the values (0, 0, 400, 400), where thecurrent window placement is (50, 50, 500, 500). The current code sets thewindow placement to (50, 50, 400, 400), which violates the requested width andheight."}
