{"bug_id": "115167", "title": "Bug 115167Library UI adjustments", "description": "1. When you create a new library, the library perspective appears. The name ofthe perspective is Lib Design. Can this use full words, instead of contractions:Library Design.2. The message shown in the new empty library is:Library currently empty, add components from the palette or the menu to thelibrary outline menu.Better wording is:This library is empty. Add components to the library outline from the palette orthe menu.3. The color of the new empty library in the editor is too dark. This colormakes it difficult to read the message. Use a lighter gray, or even white."}
