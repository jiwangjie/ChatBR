{"bug_id": "121323", "title": "Bug 121323XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information", "description": "If one enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selectionpart like section[@id='left'] then within class RelationInformation theselection is stripped of and stored in filterInfo HashMap.When leaving the dialog, RelationInformation gets persited to .rptdesign  butdata stored in filterInfo is lost.However  IMHO treating XPath expressions in that way will lead to a lotof trouble. Why can't we use the plain XPath expression (of course prependedwith the path from the data set selector itself) and let filtering be somethingfor those which need it?Kind regards,Herbert"}
