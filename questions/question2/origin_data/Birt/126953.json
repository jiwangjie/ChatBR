Instead, only file names should be used in outline view.If user has given a title to the file type (.rptdesign, .rptlibrary, .rpttemplate)that particular title should be shown in outline view. If there is no title given then the saved file name should be shown.The mouse hover on the 'node' will prompt the entire path. Additionally, properties editor under general category of the node should show the path of the file as read only."}
