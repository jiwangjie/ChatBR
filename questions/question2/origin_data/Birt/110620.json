{"bug_id": "110620", "title": "Bug 110620Can Chart dialogs be made available ?", "description": "Standalone DevelopmentWe are trying to develop a standalone application which will output a BIRT'.rptdesign' file. As creating charts in particular requires the user to chooseor set a large number of parameters, would it be possible to add the chartcreation dialog to the API so that other plugins or applications may use it andthus avoid reinventing the wheel ?In truth all of the various dialogs, data source, data set etc would be usefuladditions to the API or pluggin set for anyone embedding BIRT into their ownproject.Regards,Brian Compston"}
