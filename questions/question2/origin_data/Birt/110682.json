{"bug_id": "110682", "title": "Bug 110682Passthrough of external context objects  BPS35", "description": "The BIRT engine is often embedded as part of a middletier application server,where the BIRT components are added to the mix of various J2EE components.During report runtime, some of these other components may instantiate contextobjects, which are served to the BIRT engine for its custom data source to use.The BIRT engine will thus need to pass through such external Java objects intothe BIRT data source components for consumption. These context objects areassumed to be dynamically instantiated at report runtime, and are notstatically defined in a report design. The scope of this project thus focuses ondata source specific runtime Java objects which are instantiated external toBIRT, and are passed through to a custom data source provider plugged in theBIRT engine. Some examples of the types of external context objects that may bepassed through to a BIRT data source provider include, an open JDBC connection,a pooled connection, user authorization keys, or query parameter valuescollected outside of BIRT."}
