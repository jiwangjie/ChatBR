{"bug_id": "101751", "title": "Bug 101751Enhance IImage handler interface to allow full customization of birt image handling mechanism", "description": "BIRT currently stores temp chart/image into a directory that the viewerprovides. It assumes that the image can be accessed then as a static resource,bypassing the application server. This is achieved by generating chart/imageURL that points to the image directly.In a WAR deployment environment, the image directory can no longer be specifiedunder the webapplication, because the web app installation directory can notalways be found. The modified mechanism is to have the image directory as ahardcoded directory, instead of retrieved by getRealPath() call now. Becausethe images are no longer stored in the web app, they may not be accessibledirectly through URL without engine's help.The proposed solution is to enhance ImageHandler, so that it not only storedimage, but returns image too. This way, the web application (viewer) could setthe image handler, the engine writes the images, then the viewer, given areference to the imahe handler, could call the get functions to retrieve imagesand send back to client based on the URL.IImageHandler therefore needs to be enhanced. So do the default image handlerimplementations."}
