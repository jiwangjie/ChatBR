{"bug_id": "123840", "title": "Bug 123840Incorrect use of static fields in NEvaluator and FilterPassController", "description": "Data Engine classes org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.script.NEvaluator and FilterPassController (used for topn and bottomn filter process) use static class fields to store proessing data. This is not multithread safe. If there are concurrent requests running in the same JVM (even if they use different instances of DataEngine), data corruption will occur since multiple requests may get/set the static fields at the same time.These classes should keep all perrequest data in instance fields. Each report query need to have its own instance."}
