{"bug_id": "104397", "title": "Bug 104397JDBC Data Set Editor showing empty/system schemas", "description": "Some recent enhancements to the JDBC Data Set Editor in 1.0.1 dev build hasintroduced an unintended side effect: the Schema browser now shows empty and/orsystem schemas, which are never used to build queries. This is a regressionagainst 1.0.0 Final.See attached screenshot for an example. This is shown when creating a Sample DBdata set. Note that the \"Available Items\" pane shows a large number of empty andsystem schema names (APP, SYS, SYSCAT, etc.). Previously with 1.0.0 Final build,only the \"CLASSICMODELS\" schema is shown. We need to preserve that behavior."}
