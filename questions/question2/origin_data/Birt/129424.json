{"bug_id": "129424", "title": "Bug 129424BIRT XML ODA Driver does not handle nonEnglish strings properly", "description": "When a report is bound to an XML data source with nonEnglish strings, those strings cannot be displayed in the report properly.Steps to reproduce the problem:. Prepare an XML file with some nonEnglish characters in the values/attributes of its XML elements.(A sample XML file with traditional Chinese strings is attached.Those strings can also be replaced by the other nonEnglish strings.). Inside BIRT's Report Design Perspective, create a new report design.. Use the XML Data Source option to create a new data source with this XML file.. Create a new data set using that data source.If you use the attached XML file, specify \"/library/book\" for the Table Mapping, and add \"/title\" to the Column Mapping.Look at the Preview Results and the data in the \"title\" column are already scrambled.. If we keep going forward to add a singlecolumn table and bind the title column to the table, the preview/generated results shows illegible characters.This would be a serious issue for supporting nonEnglish languages."}
