{"bug_id": "17149", "title": "Bug 17149LibrariesPath in Java Build Path gets broken", "description": "eclipseversion: F1, linuxgtkbug: \"LibrariesPath\" of external JARs in \"Java Build Path\" gets brokenI observed the following bug:1) Call the \"Java Build Path\"Dialog via selecting a project, \"Properties\" viaright mouse button and then \"Java Build Path\".2) Enter a library path via \"Add External JARs...\" and press \"OK\"Everything is ok so far.3) Call the \"Java Build Path\"Dialog again:The path to the library I entered before is broken and eclipse does notfind the library any more. The path in the project's .classpathfile is ok.example:I created the project \"dummy\". Tried to add the external JAR \"jdom.jar\" to theLibraryPath. jdom.jar resides in the directory\"/home/mike/java/workspace/jdom/build\". I selected the path as an \"external JAR\". The path is shown correctly in the librarieslist. When I called the \"JavaBuild Path\"Dialog again the path listed in the \"Java Build Path\"Dialog /\"Libraries\" is changed to \"home/mike/java/workspace/jdom/build/jdom.jar\"(without the first slash). When selecting this entry and clicking on \"Edit\" thepath shown in the \"Edit Class Folder\"dialog is\"mike/java/workspace/jdom/build/jdom.jar\" (without \"/home/\"). After trying tocorrect the path manually in the \"Edit Class Folder\"dialog the path shown in\"Java Build Path\"Dialog / \"Libraries\" is\"dummy/home/mike/java/workspace/jdom/build/jdom.jar\".My workaround so far is to create variables for each library and to enter thelibrary paths as variables."}
