{"bug_id": "12871", "title": "Bug 12871JUnit view keeps focus even after clicking somewhere else.", "description": "Here are the scenarios I tested.Scenario 1  Bug is revealed1. Highlight a JUnit test in the packages view.2. Click the \"Run\" button.3. Highlight another test in the packages view.4. BUG...JUnit still has focus.Scenario 2  Bug is not present1. Highlight a JUnit test in the packages view.2. Click the \"Run\" button.3. Click on any other window, besided packages view.4. JUnit correctly gives up focus.It seems that when JUnit is run, it won't give up the focus to view you justcame from.This seems to be a problem for me because I'll run my test, test is successful,then I'll try to run the next test or write some code. Can't do either becauseJUnit still has focus. Now, if I click on the title bar first, I don't have aproblem, but I don't always remember to do that, nor do I want to have toremember...(old age)."}
