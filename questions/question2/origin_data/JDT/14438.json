{"bug_id": "14438", "title": "Bug 14438JarPackager support for setting comment on jar", "description": "Would it be possible to support setting a comment on jars? I'm more interestedin doing this via the API than the UI. One approach would be to set somethingin the JarPackageData which the JarWriter can extract and call setComment() onthe JarOutputStream. Alternatively, if the output stream were made accessibleto subclasses of JarWriter, I could have my own writer handle this.The ability to set a comment is actually at the ZipOutputStream level, so maybethis needs to go even further down."}
