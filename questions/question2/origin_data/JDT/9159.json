{"bug_id": "9159", "title": "Bug 9159Classpath wizard should not complain when adding missing source folder", "description": "Build 20020125 Define a project A with source folder 'src1'. Go to the .classpath file and edit it to insert one extra line:<classpathentry kind=\"src\" path=\"src2\"/ below the line referring to firstsource folder: <classpathentry kind=\"src\" path=\"src1\"/. Now, try to add this missing source folder 'src2', it isn't allowed by thewizard, one has to add a basic folder instead.Note: It is not such an uncommon scenario, the classpath modification couldsimply occur by catching up with a shared classpath having one more sourcefolder on it, and which is locally missing."}
