{"bug_id": "5473", "title": "Bug 5473ShiftLeft behavior with intermixed tabs and spaces", "description": "Build 200110251. In a default text editor type in the following:<space<tabsome text<tabsome text2. Now highlight the two lines above and execute ShiftLeft.Notice thatnothing moves.3. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the twolines are indented the same visually.Execute ShiftLeft.The text now moves.I'm not sure how this is spec'd, but in the first scenario it seems like thesecond line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left atleast to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab).At any rate, it'sdefinitely confusing if there is a stray space.You don't know why the textwon't shift."}
