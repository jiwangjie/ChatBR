{"bug_id": "3523", "title": "Bug 3523'Override in ...' should be renamed to 'Implement in...' for interfaces (1G4CNPH)", "description": "AK (11/13/00 12:30:39 PM)if i select a method in a superinterface of my class i want to \"implement\" it, not \"override\" it.however, since interfaces \"extend\" other interfaces, not \"implement them\",in interfaces you \"override\" methods from superinterfaces. (would have to check that one in the lang spec)NOTES:EG (24.07.2001 23:28:38)we have gone back and forth on the name, should do one more iteration.MA (07.08.2001 15:43:40)The name is 'Create in ...' now, and for works for interfaces / classes, for super or sub types.EG(13.08.2001 12:16:32)\"Create in\" isn't intuitive to me. Why can't the string be more sensitive?"}
