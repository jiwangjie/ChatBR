{"bug_id": "14228", "title": "Bug 14228Too easy to create duplicate methods", "description": "Build 20020418 I was browsing some source (not even actively editing). Suddenly I noticed there was a squiggle on one of the constructors. Hover told me that there were two methods (sp) with the same name. Scrolled down to see that, in fact, I did have another copy of theconstructor.Strange.How did this ever compile? It turns out I must have inadvertently dragged the constructor a little bitin the Outline. With the new DnD support in the Outline, it is far too easy to createduplicates."}
