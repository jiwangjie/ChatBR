{"bug_id": "5264", "title": "Bug 5264Class detail filtering options in packages view.", "description": "Build 20011018.The new build allows the user to expand classes in the packages view and lookat their contents. (methods and fields) It would be nice to be able to filterout this view so it didn't show you the field if you didn't want it to. (e.g.have the same options as you do in the Outline view for a Java file)"}
