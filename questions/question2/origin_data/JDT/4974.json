{"bug_id": "4974", "title": "Bug 4974Set classpath / output location should be one operation", "description": "204:1. create a project with 'src' as source folder and 'bin' as output location.2. in the project properties change the setting to use the project as sourcefolder and the project as output location. Press OkYou get the error message:'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src'The problem is that setting outputlocation and classpath are two operations.By setting the first, an illegal state is created. Like the validation (checking classpath and outputlocation at once), thesetting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation.Note that the error message is strange. I guess it should say: '/xy/src' cannot be nested in '/xy'"}
