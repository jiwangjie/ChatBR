{"bug_id": "13661", "title": "Bug 13661Labels and widgets too far apart in preference pages", "description": "Build: 20020411Steps:1. Click on WindowPreferences2. Open JavaEditor or JavaCompilerThe widgets used to select options (Combo boxes or color selection boxes) arerightaligned, and the labels are left aligned, leaving a large space between.This problem is magnified if the user opens a page that is wider than thedefault width, \"stretching\" the preference page dialog box. It takes more thana glance for the user to realize which labels line up with which widgets.See the AntConsole page for an example of a better layout. In AntConsole,the widgets are aligned, but appear closer to their labels."}
