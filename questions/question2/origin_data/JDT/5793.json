{"bug_id": "5793", "title": "Bug 5793Searching and search result presentation", "description": "I should be able to tell search whether it should consider potential matcher ornot. Often I use search for references as the peer operation to open onselection, i.e., e.g., I know there is exactly one caller and I want to jump toit.In addition, potential matches should be presented at the end of the resultlist and not at it's beginning."}
