{"bug_id": "9619", "title": "Bug 9619Move static member: Dialog details", "description": "20020212a. Mnemonicsb. Browse button is too small (use SWTUtil for standard button sizes)c. Title is used for long text. I would use the title for 'Move static field(s)' and use the description for 'x fields from xx'd. Browse offers my a type from a CU in a different project. When going to thenext page, it says 'Type not found'Only types from the source folders of the own project should be shown in thedialog.e. No validation on the type field. Type existance is not too expensive (donein the type wizard for super class), so could be done. At least isValidTypeNamef. label could say 'Select destination type:'g. Selection dialog should be initialized with the type currently entered.h. destination type can be source type: refactoring warns that this will resultin errors (which is not true) and makes pseudochanges in all referencingclasses."}
