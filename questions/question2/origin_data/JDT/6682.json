{"bug_id": "6682", "title": "Bug 6682Search in Hierarchy does not find Declarations in supers", "description": "20011206  (happened to be on Windows2000) Open an editor on a class that is in a deep hierarchy(I was in List in the SWT Widget hierarchy) In the Outline view, select a method that has a declaration in severalclasses in the hierarchy(I selected createScrollBar(int)  this method is defined in Scrollable andredefined in List) Context menu  Declarations  Hierarchy It only found the method that was defined in List, and it missed the one thatis defined in Scrollable (super of List)I notice that if you select the method (createScrollBar(int))in the superclass(Scrollable) and search for declarations in the hierarchy, it will find all ofthe methods. So I suspect that the search algorithm is only looking \"down\" fordeclarations, when it needs to look \"up\" as well."}
