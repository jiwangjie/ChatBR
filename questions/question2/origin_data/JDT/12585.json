{"bug_id": "12585", "title": "Bug 12585Packages view should not provide file and resource transfer if Java element below CU is selected", "description": "Build 20020328Form the news group (Veronika Irvine): FileTransfer: only contains valid data if a file or folder (package,project) is selected. So you get no data if a method,field, ... is selected since they aren't files or folders. ReourceTransfer: only contains valid data if an IResource is selected. LocalSelectionTransfer (internal): contains the actual selected elements.Just as aside, it is possible in the dragStart event to modify the Transfertypes available using setTransfer().Perhaps PackageExplorerPart should setthe transfer types based on what was selected when the DND operation thatwas initiated  then the \"Do not enter\" cursor will appear rather than thenull data scenario."}
