{"bug_id": "7653", "title": "Bug 7653Outline doesn't sort overloaded methods", "description": "When you set the Outline view to sort by name (the AZ button) it does notconsider the methods' arguments when sorting them.1  create the following class in Eclipse:public class OutlineTest {public void foo(int x) {}public void foo(float x) {}public void foo(long x) {}public void foo(double x) {}public void bar() {}}2  open an Outline view on the class3  by default (unsorted) it showsfoo(int x)foo(float x)foo(long x)foo(double x)bar()3  if you choose the 'AZ' button, the outline resorts tobar()foo(int x)foo(float x)foo(long x)foo(double x)I had expected it to consider the arguments for overloaded functions and tosort like:bar()foo(double x)foo(float x)foo(int x)foo(long x)(I just noticed that the Packages view seems to use the same ordering as theOutline, so this bug is not restricted to the Outline.)(I'm pretty sure that VisualAge for Java takes the arguments into account whensorting overloaded functions.)(Tested against 20011219 build)"}
