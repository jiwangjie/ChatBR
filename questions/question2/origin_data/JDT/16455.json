{"bug_id": "16455", "title": "Bug 16455Open type in hierarchy perspective. [type hierarchy]", "description": "I use open type dialog a lot to open the type in a hierarchy perpective butI can't find the preference to open the type in a hierarchy perpective anymore.I saw the button \"Hierarchy\" in the open type dialog but takes me 4 tabs to getthere instead of pressing enter. (Not acceptable).Please can you point me to the new preference if it exists. Or can you give away to make the Hierarchy button the default button.For example: If I press it once, it becames the active next time the dialog isopened."}
