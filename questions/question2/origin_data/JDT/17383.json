{"bug_id": "17383", "title": "Bug 17383create getter/setter  no explicit hint if getter/setter already exist", "description": "Create getter/setter seems to know which getter/setters exist already. However,there's no explicit way to show this. I can figure out by selecting the type(only not existing getter/setter are shown). If I select a field, I see all thesetter/getter of the type and I loose the information which setter and getterexist already."}
