Initially I didn't notice it and kept trying to use what looked toto be the text/edit area at the bottom of the page  only to discover itwas read only. Now that I have found it <g, I have unfortunately twice picked removewhich is the button sandwiched right below it.Is there a way to make hte edit more obvious? Should it be to the rightof the bottom txt area?Definitely needs to be away from the remove."}
