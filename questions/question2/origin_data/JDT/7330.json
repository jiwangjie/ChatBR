{"bug_id": "7330", "title": "Bug 7330Make more actions available on text selection", "description": "I could not find the action \"Add Javadoc Comment\" until I switched to theOutline view. I expected the action to be1. in the context menu and if not2. in the Edit (or some other global) menuI think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. Thisshould be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the contextmenu and some are not (OK  not all need to be in the context menu but all mustbe reachable from the editor e.g. via Edit menu). It is not acceptable to forceusers to switch the view."}
