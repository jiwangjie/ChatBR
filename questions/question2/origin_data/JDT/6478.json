{"bug_id": "6478", "title": "Bug 6478Jar packager progress messages misleading", "description": "When exporting classes to a JAR file, the progress message says things like:\"Exporting org.eclipse.foo.MyFile.java\"This is misleading, because it looks like it's adding .java files to the zip,but it's actually adding class files.I actually canceled the export and wentto check the jar file when I saw these messages.I suggest just trimming the.java suffix:\"Exporting org.eclipse.foo.MyFile\""}
