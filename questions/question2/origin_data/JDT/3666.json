Change the baz call tobaz(x.x.foo())2. Place the cursor after the first \"x.\"3. CtrlSpace to bring up code assist4. Type \"f\" to filter the list.5. Select, \"foo()\"6. The code is changed to:baz(x.foo().foo())I would rather it gave mebaz(x.foo()x.foo())public class X {void bar(X x) {baz(x.foo());}int foo() {return 5;}void baz(int i, int j) {}}KUM (5/21/01 9:02:11 AM)The text to replace is computed by the code assist infrastructure.Moved to ITPJCORE.PM (9/4/2001 2:58:56 PM)Option was added.PM (9/25/2001 2:20:50 PM)Removing option. UI can decide whether it wants to use the codeassist end position (until the end of current identifier) or the cursor location it used to start with, so as to controlthe amount of source to replace. The choice amongst one or the other should be conditioned by a keystroke (enter=replace until end, insert=replace until cursor location).Moving to ITPJUI. Removing codeassist option."}
