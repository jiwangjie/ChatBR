{"bug_id": "12428", "title": "Bug 12428Pull Up: Confusing message", "description": "Run Pull up on TestCase.setUp (copies the method to Assert)Go to 2nd page of wizard. In tree of changes, under Assert, we get themessage \"copy method 'void setUp()' to type 'TestCase'\". Shouldn't it be 'Copymethod 'void setUp()' FROM type 'TestCase'\" (also with uppercase C in Copy).Another thing: if I select to delete setUp from TestCase, I get under TestCasethe message \"Delete method 'void setUp()' declared intype 'junit.framework.TestCase'\". Here TestCase is shown with the fullyqualified name. Shouldn't then the 'copy method' text be consistent and alsouse the fully qualified name?(Markus)"}
