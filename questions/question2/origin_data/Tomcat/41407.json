{"bug_id": "41407", "title": "Bug 41407CLIENTCERT Authentication with JAASRealm not working", "description": "I tried to config my webapp to authenticate user by CLIENTCERT auth method.I verified my JAAS LoginModule by using \"BASIC\" to auth method and successfullyauthenticated user login.After studying Tomcat 5.5.20 source, I found that the problem is caused by theRealmBase.java and JAASRealm.java.if CLIENTCERT auth method is used, SSLAuthenticator will call the :JAASRealm.authenticate(X509Certificate certs[])As JAASRealm didn't override authenticate(X509Certificate certs[]), RealmBase'sauthenticate will be used and it will only validate the certs and then callgetPrincipal(X509Certificate) and then getPrincipal(String) is being called toget the Principal. However, in JAASRealm, this function always return null.That means Tomcat can't use JAASRealm with CLIENTCERT auth method.ThanksButler"}
