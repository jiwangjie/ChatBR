{"bug_id": "45628", "title": "Bug 45628ExtensionValidator doesn't handle wrapped lines in MANIFEST.MF", "description": "Deploying webapps that contain commonsattributesapi.jar or commonsattributescompiler.jar (downloaded from the Maven repository) fail with a message from ExtensionValidator along the lines of 'Required extension \"ant\" not found'.This happens because the MANIFEST.MF file in these jars contain wrapped lines. Per the JAR spec, lines longer than 72 bytes have to wrap. These MANIFEST.MF files contain lines like:antImplementationURL: http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/ant/jars/ant1.5. jarwhich evidently cause ExtensionValidator to complain. If you edit the MANIFEST.MF files to eliminate the continuation line:antImplementationURL: http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/ant/jars/ant1.5.jarthere are no errors."}
