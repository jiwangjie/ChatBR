{"bug_id": "50059", "title": "Bug 50059Resources are not served from /WEBINF/lib/{.jar}/METAINF/resources if metadatacomplete=\"true\" is set in web.xml", "description": "To reproduce:1. Make a Servlet 3.0 webapp (lets name it foo) with metadatacomplete=\"true\" attribute set on the webapp element in the /WEBIBNF/web.xml.2. Make a jar holding a single /METAINF/resources/index.html file. The jar should be placed in /WEBINF/lib (lets name it bar.jar).3. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and in browser go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.Expected result: 200 response and index.html served.Actual result: 404If you modify the web.xml to metadatacomplete=\"false\" and restart the app now /foo/index.html will respond as expected.I tried the same webapp with Glassfish v3.0.1 and it works as expected regardless what I set in metadatacomplete attribute.I made a quick look in the servlet 3.0 spec and as far as I can see metadatacomplete only regulates annotation and web fragment processing. In the example bar.jar has nothing to do with annotations and it is not a web fragment either but it is still handled differently depending on the metadatacomplete attribute."}
