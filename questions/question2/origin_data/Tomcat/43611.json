{"bug_id": "43611", "title": "Bug 43611autodeployment with unpackWARs=\"true\" does not work, when a context for that war file exists in server.xml", "description": "if a context for the war file exists in server.xml, the manager uploads the new.war file, but does not expand it, if the necessary directory does not exist,and if the directory exists, it is not overwritten, so you see the old application.see server.xml<Host name=\"xxx\" appBase=\"webapps\" unpackWARs=\"true\"<Context path=\"/yyy\"...if I don't have a context for yyy in server.xml, autodeploy works as expected.Even if you say, remove context from the manager application, it is always therein the application view, you can't remove it.And finally, it never cleans up the work directory for the application yyy,which I guess, is just a subsequent error of the above behaviour."}
