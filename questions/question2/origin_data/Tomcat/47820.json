{"bug_id": "47820", "title": "Bug 47820Static utility methods in Tomcat should be instance methods", "description": "Why are the static addServlet() methods in Tomcat static?I can seethey don't use any state from the instance, but isn't it cleaner to usean instance method, so that the API is uniform (everything I want to doto a tomcat instance goes through the instance)?It would be moreconsistent to follow the pattern of addServlet(String,String,String),and search for the context by name instead of requiring the instance tobe passed in to a static method."}
