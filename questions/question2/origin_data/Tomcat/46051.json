{"bug_id": "46051", "title": "Bug 46051Servlet response writer does not respect line.separator system property", "description": "Created attachment 22763 [details]remove special CoyoteWriter println handlingpublic void doGet(final HttpServletRequest request, final HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {response.setContentType(\"text/plain\");PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();writer.print(\"hello world\");writer.println(); //FIXME ignores System.getProperty(\"line.separator\") and always outputs \\r\\nreturn;}This means that if you use a servlet Writer on a Unix system to output any text based data format which is defined as requiring Unix format line endings ('\\n'), that data will be corrupted.This appears to be because org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteWriter does:private static final char[] LINESEP = { '\\r', '\\n' };public void println() {write(LINESEP);}This used to work in Tomcat 4.Looking at the old code at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/archive/tc4.0.x/tags/tc4.0.6/connectors/coyote/src/java/org/apache/coyote/tomcat4/CoyoteWriter.java it appears to defer line endings to the PrintWriter base class which does the right thing.Was this change was made to output HTTP headers properly or something?It specifically seems to override the default behavior to do this.I don't know the code well enough to determine if the attached patch to revert to the default behavior again would break something?Thanks for your consideration."}
