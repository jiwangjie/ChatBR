{"bug_id": "41578", "title": "Bug 41578Avoid SimplePool.get/put synchronization in JspFactoryImpl", "description": "Only 1 instance of the JspFactory object (JspFactoryImpl) is created.Consequently there is a single SimplePool of PageContext objects for all JSPrequests and so every JSP request must synchronize on the lock inside SimplePoolwhen getting and releasing a PageContext instance. Moreover, the pool has afixed capacity and after that, the code in JspFactoryImpl will first acquire thelock to see if there are any free objects in the pool, failing which a newPageContext object is created.Instead of a single processwide pool, a per thread pool of PageContext objectscan be used by JspFactoryImpl."}
