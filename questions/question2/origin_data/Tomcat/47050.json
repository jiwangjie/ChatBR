{"bug_id": "47050", "title": "Bug 47050StandardHostValve.status unnecessarily HTMLescapes the error message", "description": "I have written a JSP page that prints all request attributes verbatimly to the output. When I access it ashttp://localhost:8100/roland/404&amp;it outputs the following HTML code: <bodyjavax.servlet.error.message=/roland/404&amp;amp;<brjavax.servlet.error.requesturi=/roland/404&amp;<br... </bodyI was surprised that the error.message has been HTMLescaped, but the error.request hasn't. What's the intention of this escaping? It feels like Catalina is imitating PHP's magicquotes here, which it shouldn't.In my opinion, the error message should be copied to the request attribute asis and not being passed through RequestUtil.filter, so the programmer can write it to log files or a text/plain error page without unfiltering it first."}
