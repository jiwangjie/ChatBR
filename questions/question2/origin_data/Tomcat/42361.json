{"bug_id": "42361", "title": "Bug 42361POST content type incorrect for multipart forms after login", "description": "When using a form with a custom encoding (e.g. \"multipart/formdata\"), thecontent type is not restored after a redirect to a login page (authmethod = FORM).To reproduce: A page that POSTs using multipart/formdata encoding (or anything other thanapplication/xwwwformurlencoded) to a result page that is protected by a loginpage (authmethod=FORM) is invoked. Even though the multipart POST data exists (verified by reading input streamof request from result page) the content type of the request is always\"application/xwwwformurlencoded\". This only happens when redirected to the login page first.It does not happenif already logged in."}
