{"bug_id": "38352", "title": "Bug 38352Additional Entries for Default catalina.policy file.", "description": "This patch adds additional entries to the catalina.policy file. Specifically:The catalina.base/shared directory is added and given equal permissions tocatalina.home/commonjava.io.tmpdir is now readable.javax.servlet.context.tempdir is now readable. I think to be compliant with thespec, this must be allowed.Directory specified by java.io.tmpdir (which is what tomcat pointsjavax.servlet.context.tempdir to) is now read, write, delete. Again, I think thespec requires this."}
