{"bug_id": "50310", "title": "Bug 50310Manager detailed status page does not display servlets", "description": "To reproduce:1. Login to the Manager webapp2. Click \"Server Status\" and then \"Complete Server Status\" links.In TC6 the \"Complete Server Status\" page lists servlets for each deployed application.In the current TC7 it does not list them. Only summary information on each webapp is displayed.Looking at the StatusManagerServlet and StatusTransformer classes, the code to iterate over servlets is still there, but probably the JMX names have changed and are not working any more."}
