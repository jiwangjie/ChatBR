{"bug_id": "49129", "title": "Bug 49129DigestAuthenticator.md5Helper  possible incorrect lazy initialisation", "description": "Findbugs says:\"This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a nonvolatile static field. Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions, threads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object, if the method can be called by multiple threads. You can make the field volatile to correct the problem.\""}
