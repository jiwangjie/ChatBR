{"bug_id": "31027", "title": "Bug 31027 major error from minor whitespace error in properties file", "description": "A developer accidentally placed a tab character after the port number in the properties file for a tomcat instance. This prevented tomcat from listening on that port, but it was difficult to track down whether tomcat was running. Seems like the properties file reader could easily trim excess whitespace before trying to use entries."}
