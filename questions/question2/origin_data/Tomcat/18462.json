{"bug_id": "18462", "title": "Bug 18462 System.err gets override to output to System.out", "description": "I am using Eclipse to do my development and I am running tomcat 4.1.24 from within eclipse. One of the nice features of eclipse is that anything you display with System.out comes out in blue and anything you send to System.errs displayed in red. However when tomcat is running Catalina overridesSystem.err and makes it point to System.out. This is very inconvenient because its much harder to search for severe error messages in a list of millions of trivial ones."}
