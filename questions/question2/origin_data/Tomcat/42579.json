{"bug_id": "42579", "title": "Bug 42579[Patch] JNDIRealm fails to parse absolute names", "description": "Active Directory can respond to a query with SearchResult's that are notrelative.We discovered this happening with a directory hosted across manyservers when the userBase was not sufficient to identify a single server.In getUserBySearch, JNDIRealm assumes that the SearchResult is relative and goesabout creating a DN for the user by appending together the various bits of namesit gets back.This is definitely wrong for absolute names which are URL's ofthe form:ldap://server/encodeduserdnI discovered this issue in Tomcat 5.5 and a cursory look at the SVN repo forTomcat 6.0 reveals that this bug is also present there.I have a patch for this issue which I will attach."}
