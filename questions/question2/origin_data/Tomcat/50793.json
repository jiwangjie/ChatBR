{"bug_id": "50793", "title": "Bug 50793Invalid DispatchType in ServletRequestListener on async dispatch", "description": "If a ServletRequestListener is defined, when is invoked after a call to AsyncContextdispatch() the DispatcherType returned from the ServletRequest is REQUEST rather than ASYNC. When the actual servlet is invoked, the type is correctly set to ASYNC.If the listener is intended to be invoked for each dispatch, then the DispatcherType should match the value returned in the filter/servlet."}
