{"bug_id": "42559", "title": "Bug 42559ErrorReportValve does not provide an error report", "description": "rev 535915 changed the behavior of ErrorReportValve in tomcat6 to not produce anerror report when response.sendError() is called. For example, using this codein a servlet's service() does not produce an error report:response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SCGONE, \"error occurred\");The underlying cause is that the valve's check for response.isCommitted() wasreplaced with response.isAppCommitted().The latter returns true, which causesthe Valve's invoke() method to immediately return instead of producing the report."}
