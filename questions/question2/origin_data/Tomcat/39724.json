For what I understand an empty pipeline has:basic = StandardEngineValve (For example);first = null;If you add a valve you will getbasic = StandardEngineValvefirst = myValve (with myValve.next = StandardEngineValve)If you remove the valve you will getbasic =StandardEngineValvefirst = StandardEngineValveNote that StandardEngineValve is in first too here.If I try to add a new valve given the actual code inaddValve the valve willnot be added because (see the ) current = basic and current.getNext() = null;addValve(Valve valve) {// Add this Valve to the set associated with this Pipelineif (first == null) {first = valve;valve.setNext(basic);} else {Valve current = first;while (current != null) {if (current.getNext() == basic) {current.setNext(valve);valve.setNext(basic);break;}current = current.getNext();}}}"}
