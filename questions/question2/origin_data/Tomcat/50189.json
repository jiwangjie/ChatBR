{"bug_id": "50189", "title": "Bug 50189AJP connector sends GET BODY CHUNK when reading after response closed", "description": "If a servlet (probably incorrectly) closes the writer/outputstream of a response, and then attempts to read from the request, the AJP connector sends GET BODY CHUNK to the modjk worker.This then starts a series of very confusing communication between the worker and tomcat.The worker doesn't read it until it makes its next request.After making its next request, it reads it, and then sends a response with 0 length.At the same time, Tomcat responds to the request made by the worker with another GET BODY CHUNK, which the worker also responds with a message of 0 length.Then the really weird thing happens, Tomcat replays the first request made by that worker.At this point, based on what I'm looking at with tcpdump, I get too confused to work out exactly what is happening."}
