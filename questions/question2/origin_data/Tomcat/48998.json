{"bug_id": "48998", "title": "Bug 48998Proposal : port modexpires in java as ExpiresFilter Servlet Filter", "description": "Created attachment 25189 [details]Port of modexpires as ExpiresFilterHere is a proposal to port Apache Httpd modexpires in java as ExpiresFilter, a standard Servlet Filter.I detailed a standalone version on http://code.google.com/p/xebiafrance/wiki/ExpiresFilter . More over, I tried my best to provide very detailed javadocs and docs (in filter.html).The proposed contribution is slightly different because it uses Tomcat logging, few Servlet 3 enhancements and test cases use Tomcat engine.The attached patch contains : ExpiresFilter.java : the Expires Filter TestExpiresFilter : detailed test cases filter.xml : doc updatesThe filter has been optimized using a profiler and stress tested with Apache Bench under high load."}
