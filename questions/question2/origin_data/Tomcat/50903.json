{"bug_id": "50903", "title": "Bug 50903Current keepalive request processed after connector.stop()", "description": "When the connector is stopped, if a connection is in a keepalive state the next request received by that connection will be processed and then the connection will be closed. When the request is received, it should be rejected.Outstanding questions: What return code (if any) should be sent back to the client? If the reading of a request starts before the connector is stopped, should that request be allowed to complete or should it be rejected?"}
