{"bug_id": "46925", "title": "Bug 46925Nested groups in JNDI realm with nonrecursive implementation", "description": "Created attachment 23420 [details]Patch which replaced the recursive method with a while loop (\"memberOf Algorithm\")I have modified the method getRoles in org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm in the trunk in order to use a while loop to detect nested groups (instead of the recursive method currently implemented there).The algorithm is inspired by the article \"Practices in Directory Groups\" found here: http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/internet2macedirgroupsbestpractices200210.htmIt avoids group slurping and handles cyclic group memberships as well.Find a patch attached.Greetings from Amsterdam, Stefan"}
