{"bug_id": "45823", "title": "Bug 45823AccessLogValve doesn't correctly handles combined log format (with patch)", "description": "Created attachment 22595 [details]Patch that corrects this bugWhen configuring the AccessLogValve valve to use the combined log format and either referer or useragent fields are unavailable in the request, the corresponding log entry fields will contain \"(null)\" instead of \"\". This behaviour breaks access log analyzers like AWStats and I believe it's also a violation of the log spec.Included is a patch that I believe will correct the problem. The patch make sure that any nonexisting header will be logged as '' instead of trying to log a null pointer.I stumbled on this problem when upgrading from Tomcat 5.5 to 6.0.16 using Debian etch and JDK 6. Tomcat 5.5 didn't suffer from this issue.I haven't yet tried Tomcat 6.0.18 but the AccessLogValve.java file seems to be unchanged between the two releases so I suspect the problem still exists."}
