{"bug_id": "50895", "title": "Bug 50895JSP compiler initializes classes during compile which can result in failures", "description": "The fix for Bug 49555 adds the following code call:clazz = Class.forName(className, true, tccl);The 2nd argument (initialize) is set to true resulting in it attempting to initialize the class.This can result in compilation failures if the class has ugly static initializer requirements.It can also increases the time and memory footprint of compilation as the classes.I think for the purposes of the getCanonicalName() call, the second argument should be set to false to prevent initialization of the class in question."}
