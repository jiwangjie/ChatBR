{"bug_id": "31804", "title": "Bug 31804setParent() is not called on nested tags in a tag file (.tagx)", "description": "Hi, everybody.Suppose I have a tag file (.tagx to be precise). I have some custom tags of mineincluded in that tag file. If I override setParent() in such a custom tag, then I see, that it's invoked with \"null\" parameter. Custom tag is a \"Classic\" tag(extends TagSupport).Simplified example: This tag file is called \"submit.tagx\"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF8\"?<jsp:root xmlns:jsp=\"http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page\" xmlns:custom=\"http://my.com/tagshtml\" version=\"2.0\" <jsp:directive.tag bodycontent=\"empty\"/<jsp:directive.attribute name=\"action\" required=\"true\" rtexprvalue=\"true\"/<jsp:directive.attribute name=\"label\" required=\"true\" rtexprvalue=\"true\"/<custom:submit action=\"${action}\" label=\"${label}\" name=\"submitButton\" /</jsp:rootIn debug output from setParent(Tag) of custom:submit I see, that it's calledwith \"null\" value.If, instead of custom:submit, I put there another custom tag, which followsSimpleTagSupport model, then setParent(JspTag) is not called at all!!!I would expect a reference to something, representing translated class of TagFile (submit.tagx) is passed.As the result, tag nesting tree is broken.I need to access Struts html:form tag, which is the embracing tag from my inner<custom:submit tag to obtain form name, but this is not possible.<nested:form action=\"/Action\"<ctrl:submit action=\"save\" label=\"Save\"/</nested:form(where ctrl:submit is submit.tagx)"}
