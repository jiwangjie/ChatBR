{"bug_id": "50836", "title": "Bug 50836LifecycleStateisAvailable() to be more restrictive", "description": "I think some of the values returned by LifecycleStateisAvailable() are wrong.1. I am certain that MUSTDESTROY should return false, because it is a state that is later than stopped.2. I think that STOPPINGPREP should return false, because we can get there from the FAILED state.3. I think that STARTING should return false, because it is too early to return true there.As a result, the following is the complete list of states are to return true in isAvailable():STARTED, MUSTSTOP"}
