{"bug_id": "40150", "title": "Bug 40150Incorrect User/Role classnames are silently ignored.", "description": "org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASRealm does not verify any of the class names thatare set through setRoleClassNames() and setUserClassNames().If an incorrect class name (e.g. a typo) is configured in context.xml, this isunnoticed by JAASRealm. The result is that during authentication, when thesubject's principals are checked against the configured class names, theprincipals are not recognised, and therefore not added to the subject.The fact an incorrect configured class name is currently not detected and loggedmakes it very hard to find the source of the problem. It can be easily fixed bychecking the class names in the two methods mentioned above. The class mustexist, and it must implement java.security.Principal, which is currently notenforced/checked by the code."}
