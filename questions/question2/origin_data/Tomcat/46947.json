{"bug_id": "46947", "title": "Bug 46947Code cleanup patch that removes some obsolete null checks", "description": "Created attachment 23432 [details]Patch against trunkAs discussed at ApacheCon with Mark and Peter, here is a patch against trunk that removes obsolete null checks where the variable has already been dereferenced earlier.The patch doesn't fix all issues that Findbugs reports in the \"RCN\" category. I was not able to confirm the remaining ones and I suspect some false alarms.Note to reviewer: The diffs for Generator.java are quite hard to follow in the patch file, maybe it's easier for you to just remove the \"if (attrInfos != null)\" check yourself in the original code."}
