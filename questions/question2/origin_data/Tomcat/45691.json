{"bug_id": "45691", "title": "Bug 45691Jasper creates duplicate variable names", "description": "Sometimes a JSP's Java code, which have been generated by Jasper, has duplicate variable names. Therefore the JSP cannot be compiled and tomcat delivers an HTTP status code 500. You get an error message like thisorg.apache.jasper.JasperException: Unable to compile class for JSP:An error occurred at line: 10 in the jsp file: /test1.jspDuplicate local variable jspxtemp07:<c:set var=\"a\"8:<jsp:attribute name=\"value\"<%= new java.util.Date().toString() %</jsp:attribute9:</c:set10:<c:set var=\"b\"11:<jsp:attribute name=\"value\"<%= new java.util.Date().toString() %</jsp:attribute12:</c:set13:<h1Test 1</h1The reason of this error is the generation of variable names like jspxtemp0, which are created for <jsp:attribute tags. At the beginning of parsing a JSP file a counter is reset to 0. Every time an <jsp:attribute tag occurs, the counter is used to build a variable name jspxtemp<counter. Thereafter the counter will be incremented. Unfortunately the counter is a static member of the JspUtil class. Suppose there's a thread 1, which created jspxtemp4. The counter is 5. Now a second thread (thread 2) starts and resets the counter. Afterwards thread 2 creates jspxtemp0 to jspxtemp3. The counter is 4 by now. Then thread 2 stops and thread 1 continues. The next variable's name in thread 1 will be jspxtemp4, which already exists. Therefore the generated java class cannot be compiled."}
