{"bug_id": "48252", "title": "Bug 48252StackOverflowError in NioEndpoint.setProperty when setting jkHome", "description": " Noticed only when running in debugger with breakpoint set for StackOverflowError. The error is translated by Java's reflection mechanism to an InvocationTargetException, which is caught and silently ignored by IntrospectionUtils. Connector.initialize() sets jkHome property on Http11NioProtocol. Http11NioProtocol sets jkHome property on NioEndpoint. NioEndpoint recursively invokes its own setProperty method via IntrospectionUtils.setProperty, causing the stack overflow. Using embedded Tomcat. Using Nio connector. Does not happen for standard connector. Happens in 6.0.18 and 6.0.20; haven't tested with earlier versions."}
