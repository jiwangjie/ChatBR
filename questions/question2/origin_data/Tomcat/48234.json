{"bug_id": "48234", "title": "Bug 48234org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.getLogger() not threadsafe?", "description": "org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.getLogger() is not synchronised, yet all the other methods which access org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.logger are synch. This seems wrong.org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.logger should probably be private to prevent unsynch. access by subclasses.Similar considerations apply to logName and logName()The Javadoc for getLogger() states that it can return null  that does not appear to be possible. [Not sure if the method ever returns the parent logger either.]"}
