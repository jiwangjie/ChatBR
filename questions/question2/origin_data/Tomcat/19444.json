{"bug_id": "19444", "title": "Bug 19444JNDI Authentication roles must be anonymous accessible", "description": "It appears that for the JNDIRealm to be able to locate roles, they must beanonymous accessible. I believe that for security purposes this should not benecessary if we are validating the user by binding to the directory. In thatcase the roles could be accessible to any bound user or that particular user. Idiscussed this very briefly on the Tomcat user list. It sounds like this hadbeen discussed previously and for whatever reason, the idea rejected. Anyhow Isubmit that there is a bug, either in the code  which requires the roles to beanonymous, or in the documentation which does not make it clear that this isthe case (at least in \"Tomcat 4 Servlet/JSP Container  Realm Configuration HOWTO). It seems reasonable to me that if we are binding to the directory toauthenticate, we would have that user's access to roles. Perhaps thedocumentation should more explicetly state that this is not the case.In the hope that it would be accepted as an enhancement, I am going to attemptto attach a modified JNDIRealm that uses the authenticated connection to obtainthe roles.Thank You,Art"}
