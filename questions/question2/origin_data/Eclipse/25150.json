{"bug_id": "25150", "title": "Bug 25150[Dialogs] File property page has large vertical area on GTK", "description": "Build 20021018There are a number of problems with the way the properties are displayedfor files:1. The readonly text fields are displayed with a white background. Byconvention, a white background tells the user that a text field iseditable. Noneditable text fields should be drawn with a gray background.2. The text fields are not drawn with a border. The combination of a whitebackground and no border makes the fields look sloppy.3. The text fields are poorly sized. The \"Path:\" and \"Location:\" fields aretoo tall (vertically) and the \"Last Modified: field is too thin(horizontally)."}
