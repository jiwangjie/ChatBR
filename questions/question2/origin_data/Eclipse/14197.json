Open the working set dialog again, create a second working set, delete thefirst. At the moment of delete, the package view in the background refilters.In my opinion refiltering should only happen when closing the working setselection dialog, not while manipulating. I also think that pressing cancelshould cancel all changes I did to woking sets ( cancel the remove)"}
