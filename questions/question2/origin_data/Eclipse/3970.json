{"bug_id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970[preferences] UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files (1GFIOAX)", "description": "When creating a new file we currently use the line delimiter returned form System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). But this is notwhay a user always wants. Consider the following sceanrio: Unix and Windows work station used to develop a Unix product / program. the Windows work stations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PC are cheaper than Unix boxes). even if the new file is created on Windows it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product.There should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are: Dos / Windows Mac Unix default platform line delimiter.The UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.NOTES:"}
