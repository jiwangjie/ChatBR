{"bug_id": "15086", "title": "Bug 15086Working set may loose some projects", "description": "Build 20020501I had defined a working set 'jdtcore' containingproject 'org.eclipse.jdt.core'. At some later point, I deleted and readded thisproject (while working in between multiple streams).From thereon, the working set was empty, and all searches did not find anythingany longer.A working set should preserve references to unexisting projects, in case theyare added (back) at some later point; pretty much as deleting a project doesn'timplicitly remove it from a buildpath."}
