{"bug_id": "10034", "title": "Bug 10034Inconsistent file structure for export selected directories", "description": "Since the version 2.0, we have an abnormal behaviour with the export function.With 1.0 version, if we have a project name <test with a default package and apackage called <pactest, and choose to export this project into a file systmefolder <foldertest, the result is : all the classes of default package are exported directly in the root of thisfolder all the classes of <pactest are exported in the subfolder <pactestNow, with the version 2.0, all the classes of default package are exported directly in the root of thisfolder eclipse creates a subfolder with the name of the projet, here \"test\" and allthe classes of <pactest are exported in the subfolder <pactest of this newfolder.So, I don't if it's a bug or not. But I think we have to choose between twoways : the export funtion works as the version 1.0 Eclipse creates a folder with projet name, but in this case, put the defaultpackages classes in the root of this subfolder and not directly in the targetfolder.Thanks and sorry for my poor english.David.PS : Congratulations for Eclipse Product"}
