{"bug_id": "20430", "title": "Bug 20430[Cell Editors] DialogCellEditor in the PropertySheet bases its width on its text rather than its cell's width", "description": "In the PropertySheetViewer we have properties that have DialogCellEditor andComboCellEditor editors.With both of these the user will click the cell editorand then needs ot use the open dialog button or drop down combo button.Theeditor is created with the width of the contents ( for the combo editor this isthe widest strings in the list of strings ) and the button is on the right ofthis.The problem our users have is that we have labels that are wider than thewidth of the values column and they click in the column and can't see the open/ drop down editor button.Sometimes even scrolling doesn't bring it into view( maybe a separate problem here to do with the size of the horizontal scroll bar) and the only way of getting the button to become visible is to resize thewhole property sheet to make the values column larger.I would expect that the editor width would just be the width of the valuescolumn so the button is always in view."}
