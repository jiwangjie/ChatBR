{"bug_id": "18310", "title": "Bug 18310Preference Dialog gets too large for pages with tables", "description": "In a lower resolution mode if a preference page has a table (like the installedJREs) it is possible for the page to get too large to fit onto the screen relaestate. The size of the table is dependant on the size of the previous pagescomposite  if it was a large on the preferred size of the table will be large.I suggest we have a maximum page size  say 800x800 (we already have a 400 x 400minimum).Note that on Linux dialogs are resizable so we may want to defer this.STEPS1) Open the Preference Dialog2) select the Installed JRE page. Table columns are truncated (correctly).3) Select Ant preference page4) Hit OK5) Open the Preference Dialog  Ant is default selected and quite large6) Selected installed JREs  button is cut off."}
