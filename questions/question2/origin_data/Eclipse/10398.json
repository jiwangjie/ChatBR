{"bug_id": "10398", "title": "Bug 10398SWT error causes Workbench meltdown", "description": "A few minutes ago I discovered the new dialog for reportinginternal errors related to SWT.It said something like:\"An SWT error has occurred.You should exit the workbenchnow.Further errors could cause the workbench to closewithout notice.\"This is more or less what happened:Curious, I clicked on Details.No additional details pane appeared.So I clicked again.Then the workbench closed without notice, but the dialog remained.So I stupidly clicked Details again.The \"saving workbench state\" progress monitor appeared againand went away.So I clicked ok.And it tried to save the workbench state again, and popped up a newSWT error dialog.I think I clicked away (with Ok) one or two more of the things.After this point, Eclipse hangs on startup after closing thesplash screen.To recover, I tried the following: delete the .lock file and try again delete the .registry file and try again delete everything under .metadata/plugins except org.eclipse.core.resourcesThis worked.I would attach an archive of my workspace, but I did not think aboutit at the time.Sorry!"}
