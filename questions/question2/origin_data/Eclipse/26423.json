{"bug_id": "26423", "title": "Bug 26423[JFace] Make reusable Icons public API", "description": "I cannot find Icons without using internal API.I need to reuse Eclipse Icons like Delete, Undo, Redo, Navigate Up, NavigateInto, and potentially any other Icons.Plugins can already obtain these Icons by reaching into the org.eclipse.uiinstallation directory. But, if I do it this way I create my ownImageDescriptor, and ActionContributionItem will cache it separately, wastingOS resources. So why not make these icons (ImageDescriptors) availableprogrammatically as well in SharedImages?"}
