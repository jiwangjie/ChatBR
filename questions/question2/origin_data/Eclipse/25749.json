{"bug_id": "25749", "title": "Bug 25749[Dialogs] Setting help has uncleared busy cursor", "description": "Build 20021105.Currently if one uses existing JFace dialogs (e.g., ElementSelectionTreeDialog)there is no way to set the F1 help for the dialog.The help listener wouldhave to be added on the shell, but the shell is not created until the openmethod is called (at which point the modal nature of the dialog prohibitssetting anything for the shell).So to set help for one of these dialogs, theuser would have to subclass the dialog.Quite a heavyweight operation for asimple thing."}
