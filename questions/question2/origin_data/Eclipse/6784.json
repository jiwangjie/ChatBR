{"bug_id": "6784", "title": "Bug 6784Reused editor closes fast view", "description": "When editor reusing is starting the fast views no longer work correctly. This isbecause during the reuse process (I guess) the new editor is activated eventhough it is opened with activate=false.Test Case:1. Search (text or Java) for something which gives results in different files2. Make the Search view a fast view3. Step through the results== OK: the Search view stays open and the editor is reused (coded in search)4. Now switch to the a new implementation (no editor reuse):Change the code in SearchUI.reuseEditor() to return <codefalse</code5. Start Eclipse6. Repeat step 1. to 3.== each file opens in a new editor and Search view stay open untilthe editor reusing begins: now the Search (fast) view gets closed."}
