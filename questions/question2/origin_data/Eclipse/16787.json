{"bug_id": "16787", "title": "Bug 16787[Wizards] Wizards are recreated when returning to New page", "description": "The WizardDialog ask's in showPage() or showStartingPage():if (page.getControl() == null)to support a lazy page control creation.This works fine when the wizard is called first time. After disposing a pagepage.getControl() still returns a (disposed) control and page.createControl(pageContainer) is not called again.I overwrote the method:public void dispose() {super.dispose();this.setControl(null);}in all my pages as workaround. I suggest to add this method to WizardPage."}
