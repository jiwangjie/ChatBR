The problemseems to be the following code:public ActionDecriptorActionDescriptor(IConfigurationElement actionElement,int targetType, Object target) {....action = createAction(targetType, actionElement, target);// The above call changes the action's label.action.setText(label); <== sets the label defined in XML.}"}
