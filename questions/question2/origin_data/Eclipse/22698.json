{"bug_id": "22698", "title": "Bug 22698[Import/Export] Import several projects at once", "description": "Eclipse R2.0Right now if someone wants to import a projects to the workspace it has to bedone one at a time. Usecase: someone lost the metadata for some reason. Allthe projects were in the default workspace location. The person now starts anew Eclipse session and wants to import the projects. It would be nice if theuser could multiselect projects and import all at once. Another option wouldbe to specify a root folder and for each immediate child look for a .projectfile. If it exists than we could try to import the project from that location."}
