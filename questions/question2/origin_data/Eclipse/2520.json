{"bug_id": "2520", "title": "Bug 2520Minor: active editor is not updated properly (1GFIS9J)", "description": "I.When you select an open editor via the Navigator or Packages views, it will become visiblebut not active.This is probably the desired behaviour but the only problem is if you tryto do an editor action (such as Close) it will close the last active editor, not the currentvisible one.This can be a bit confusing but is not major.Steps:1) create file 'abc', the editor should become visible and active2) create file 'xyz', the editor should become visible and active3) click on 'abc' in the navigator, notice that abc's editor becomes visible but not active4) File  Close (or Ctrl+F4)xyz closes, you would have expected abc to close.II.When you do a draganddrop operation on an editor to split up the editors, the editoris shown as active but the Close operation does not affect it.Steps:1) create file 'abc', the editor should become visible and active2) create file 'xyz', the editor should become visible and active3) grab the title bar of 'abc' and drag it to an edge thus spliting up the editor workspace do this in one action (do not select it before moving)4) File  Close'xyz' close, 'abc' should have closedNOTES:JEL (19/06/2001 3:11:00 PM)from CloseEditorAction::run  IEditorPart part = getActiveEditor();could be changed to  IEditorPart part = activePage.getEditorPresentation().getVisibleEditor();This would tell the workbench to close the Editor that is being viewed instead of the last editorthat was clicked on."}
