{"bug_id": "6827", "title": "Bug 6827Delete project reports \"internal errors\" with normal use case", "description": "1) Create a java project \"Foo\", containing file \"abc.txt\"2) In the filesystem, delete \"abc.txt\".3) In the packages view, select project \"Foo\" and hit delete.4) To the delete content question, click \"Yes\".An error dialog pops up.message: Unexpected exception.See log for details.Reason: Status.Details: Resource is out of sync with the file system: /Foo/abc.txtIf you follow the same steps, but delete some folder in the filesystem, the logfile reports \"Internal Errors\".Cases like this shouldn't report \"unexpected exceptions\" and \"internalerrors\"... this is expected to be quite a common scenario when people are usingexternal tools on their source files.I believe this is a use case we shouldhandle more gracefully.The resources plugin provides facilities in its API fordealing with this, namely the IResourceStatusOUTOFSYNCLOCAL status code, andthe \"force\" flag on all API methods."}
