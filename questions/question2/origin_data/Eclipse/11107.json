{"bug_id": "11107", "title": "Bug 11107Action filter asking closed project for natures", "description": "IProjecthasNature(String) is spec'ed to throw an exception if the project isclosed, and I recently fixed the implementation to match this.WorkbenchProjecttestAttribute calls this method when filtering actions, and asa result, many CoreExceptions are now thrown when a user rightclicks on aclosed project in the navigator.These exceptions don't surface because the code in WorkbenchProjectcurrently swallows the exception.However, it would be good to fix the UI codeto avoid the overhead of all these exceptions (exception and status objectscreated, message binding, throw/catch overhead, etc).I recommend:} else if (name.equals(PROJECTNATURE)) {try {IProject proj = res.getProject();return proj.isAccessible() && proj.hasNature(value);} catch (CoreException e) {return false;}}"}
