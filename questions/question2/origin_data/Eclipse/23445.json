{"bug_id": "23445", "title": "Bug 23445[Perspectives] Select All in Window / Customize Perspective Doesn't Work", "description": "Opening Bug for Dave Ings:This problem occurs on the 09/07 WSAD driver (which includes 2.0.1).1. Make the resource perspective the default, and open it.2. Go to Window / Customize Perspective and expand Window  Open Perspective.About half a dozen perspectives are selected.3. Select all perspectives by checking the \"root\" check box. Click OK.4. Select the resource perspective and click on the \"Open a Perspective\" buttonon the left hand toolbar.5. Only 9 of the 16 perspectives are shown.6. The same behaviour occurs if instead you invoke Window / Open Perspective.I can't seem to find any preference that configures the length of the list ofperspectives.I tried a similar test in Eclipse 2.0, and it works fine there."}
