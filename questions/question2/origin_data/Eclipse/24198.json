{"bug_id": "24198", "title": "Bug 24198[Global Actions] CloseResourceAction passes null IProgressMonitor to editor.doSave()", "description": "The saveDirtyEditors() method of theorg.eclipse.ui.actions.CloseResourceAction class is passing nullto editor.doSave() instead of passing a NullProgressMonitor.Existing editors seem to cope fine with this but until we didthe workaround in our own flow editor, it would put up an uglyNPE dialog when this code was run.NullProgressMonitor is an instance of the NullObject pattern, thepurpose of which is to relieve objectmanipulating code of theburden of checking for null.Since we have NullProgressMonitors,passing null as an IProgressMonitor should always be consideredbogus unless null has a special meaning like \"use the default\".(If the UI team disagrees, then IEditorPart.doSave()'s commentshould be changed to mention the fact that null is an acceptable value)."}
