Also, loadingEclipse can take a lot of time depending on the workspace. It would be goodhave a progress bar to indicate whether it's really hanging or still booting.Of course, some status info should be displayed as well (like which pluginis being loaded, etc.).Please have a look at the Gimp splash screen to see what I mean."}
