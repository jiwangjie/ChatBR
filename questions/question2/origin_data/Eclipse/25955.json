{"bug_id": "25955", "title": "Bug 25955[Workbench] Exiting while saving can cause problems", "description": "This seems to be a problem with either the workbench in general or the editorstructure in particular. I have reproduced this with the Java editor but thereis no reason why it wouldn't occur with other editors as well.Dirty a Java editor.Press Ctrl+S to save the editor.While it is saving, quickly close the main perspective window, either byclicking the X or by choosing FileSave.When prompted to save dirty resources say Okay.An error dialog appears stating that the save failed, and a stack trace isprinted to the log (sorry, I don't have my log anymore, but it's fairly easy toreproduce).The dialog says:\"Problems occurred while trying to save the state of the workbench.\"Details: \"Save cannot be called from inside an operation.\"I guess the real problem is that I'm able to exit while a workspace operation istaking place.Reproduced on both Win2K and Linux."}
