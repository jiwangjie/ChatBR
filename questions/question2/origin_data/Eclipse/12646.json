{"bug_id": "12646", "title": "Bug 12646Switching working sets should preserved expanded state", "description": "From Nick's working set UI testing notes:\" We should try to preserve the expanded state when switching working sets.E.g. if I have a CU selected in project P, if I switch to a working set showingjust P, the CU should still be visible and selected.Any folders which were expanded under P should still be expanded as well.Use AbstractTreeViewer.get/setExpandedElements().\""}
