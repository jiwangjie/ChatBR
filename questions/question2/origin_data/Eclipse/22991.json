{"bug_id": "22991", "title": "Bug 22991[Dialogs] FilteredList.setSelection does not work as expected", "description": "setSelection does not work if called from the same eventhandling loop assetElements. This is because it starts a new thread which synchronously addsnew items to the table. Thus, setSelection (which simply callsTable.setSelection) has no effect, since the table is empty.The behaviour is best visible on JDT Choose Package subdialog of New Classdialog  the preselected package is allways the first one, not the one enteredinthe box."}
