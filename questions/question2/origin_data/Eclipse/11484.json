{"bug_id": "11484", "title": "Bug 11484[Contributions] Contributions are being rebuilt too often", "description": "This started out as an investigation to see if we were reading image filesmultiple times and ended up exposing bigger problems.If you open two java editors and switch between them you will notice that theperspective .gif files are being read every time the editor changes.This turns out to be the result of callingChangeToPerspectiveMenu.createMenuItem() as it creates new images each time.A hack to cache the images or avoiding making this menu dynamic or avoidingrecreating the menu when the perspective has not changed are incomplete fixesfor this defectProblem 1.This method ends up being called from the OutlineView's update call. Thisdoes not make any sense. I can understand that we have to update the localtoolbar for the OutlineView. This does not imply that we have to updateeverything else.Problem 2:It ends up being called twice. Once for the outline view, the other for theeditor."}
