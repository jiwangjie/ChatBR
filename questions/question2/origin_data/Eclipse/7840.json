{"bug_id": "7840", "title": "Bug 7840adaptable flag on property pages doesn't work if filtered by nature", "description": "(Apologies if this is a dup, I couldn't find such a bug anywhere).org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui defines the following property page:<page name=\"%CVS\" id=\"org.eclipse.team.ccvs.ui.propertyPages.CVSPropertiesPage\"objectClass=\"org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject\"class=\"org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSPropertiesPage\"adaptable=\"true\"<filter name=\"nature\" value=\"org.eclipse.team.cvs.core.cvsnature\"/</pageIn the packages view, this does not work because I believe the filter is beingtested BEFORE the adaptation takes place. The IJavaProject does not havethe \"nature\" value set, but the IProject that it adapts to DOES, so the filtershould be tested after adaptation rather than before.The result is that nonCVS projects have a CVS properties page in the packagesview, and likewise nonCVS compilation units (not IFiles, they work fine) alsohave a CVS properties page due to a similar declaration in the plugin.xml."}
