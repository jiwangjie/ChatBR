{"bug_id": "18335", "title": "Bug 18335Perspective contents lost when view is maximized", "description": "All the contents of the perspective (views, layout info) is lost when thefollowing actions are performed in F1:Maximize a view in any perspective. Switch to another perspective and exit theworkbench. Open the workbench and switch to the perspective with the maximizedview. Observe that only the maximized view is actually present and all otherviews are missing from the perspective.As far as I can remember, view maximize code replaced the page layout with atemporary one that contained only the maximized view. This temporary layoutmust be getting persisted instead of the proper layout when the workbench isclosed."}
