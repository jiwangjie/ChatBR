{"bug_id": "22360", "title": "Bug 22360[Fonts] FontRegistry can not instantiated using resources outside org.eclipse.jface.resource", "description": "I get MissingResourceException when I am trying to create FontRegistry instancefor my application as follows:com.company.product.MyClasspublic void createFontRegistry(){FontRegistry fonts = new FontRegistry(\"com.company.product.fonts\");}where I do have a file fonts.properties in my com/company/product/folder.However, if I try this instead:com.company.product.MyClasspublic void createFontRegistry(){ResourceBundle fonts = ResourceBundle.getBundle((\"com.company.product.fonts\");}There is no exception.Moreover, if I create a complete copy of the FontRegsitry class in mycom.company.product package  then it works.My guess is  it is a bug in the FontRegistry. It tries to load the fontsresource bundle, but the FontRegistry's class loader is used to do that (seereadResourceBundle(String) FontRegistry method). Therefore all the resourcesthat are being looked up are the only ones relative to the location of theFontRegistry class  org.eclipse.jface.resource path.It can be remedied if FontRegistry took a client class (or class loader) as anadditional parameter to the constructor. Alternatively it can allow clients toload their own resource bundle and take it as a parameter to the constructor(Vs. name of the bundle)."}
