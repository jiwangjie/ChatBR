{"bug_id": "10842", "title": "Bug 10842[Contributions] ordering: ActionFactories should support groups", "description": "Build 20020305JDT uses groups to control the positioning of menu items in context menus. JDTwould like to reuse some of the UI's action factories. But currently theysimply add the entries to the end of the menu. It would be helpful if a actionfactory would support an additional group. If specified the factory adds theitems to that group, if not specified it addes the items to the end of the menu."}
