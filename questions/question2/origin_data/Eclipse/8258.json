{"bug_id": "8258", "title": "Bug 8258Error message not nice when view is missing on startup", "description": "If you remove a plugin that defined a view that was open on shutdown, you get anunfriendly message just stating that an error occurred (see error log, etc).For example, turn off the plugin org.eclipse.vcm.ui.This case is common enoughthat the error message should be more informative.It should say which view itfailed to open, and explain that a component has been removed.It should alsosay that the error is not critical, and that the user can continue working withthat workbench.Note this will happen for almost everyone who tries to go from1.0 to 2.0 with an old workspace (because of removed debug and VCM views), sothe upgrade path should be more friendly."}
