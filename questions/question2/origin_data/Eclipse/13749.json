{"bug_id": "13749", "title": "Bug 13749NPE on opening a multipage editor. MultiPageEditorPart isDirty should check for null", "description": "Using the 4/12 integration build, it appears \"isDirty\" is sometimes called inMulitPageEditorPart before there are any nestedEditors, so it should be checkedto be sure its not null, before calling iterator on it. (or alternatively, tomake sure nestedEditors is always intialized so iterator would simply return azero length iterator  it currently isn't initialized until a page is added).I have not seen this occur on the \"built in\" multipage editors (e.g. PDE), butdoes occur in our Mutlipage XML editor in WSAD (and we have created our ownsubclass of MulitPageEditorPart).So, there may be something about the start up init sequence we've inadvertentlychanged, but seems reasonable make sure nestedEditors isn't null before usingit.A workaround is to subclass 'isDirty' and catch the NPE and ignore it."}
