{"bug_id": "11650", "title": "Bug 11650[Wizards] WizardNewProjectCreationPage doesn't validate on startup", "description": "I construct this page and use the setInitialProjectName() to set a defaultname.The project name field is set properly, but the default project locationdoesn't append this initial project name to the end of it.If I uncheck andthen recheck the checkbox, the project location field is set how I thought itshould have been set.The second problem is that validatePage() is called within createControl(),but the return value is not used in a call to setPageComplete().I tried doing this myself, but validatePage() is private and the projectlocation field is also private!Basically the functionality that is desired is the ability to set a defaultproject name for the user, and make the page complete (as long as the projectdoesn't already exist of course, but the validatePage should handle this).I'm using this in our XML example wizards for WSAD.Thanks,Ernest"}
