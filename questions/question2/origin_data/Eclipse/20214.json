{"bug_id": "20214", "title": "Bug 20214F3: Rename operation broken on AIX", "description": "Create a simple project, create a simple file, and then attempt to rename it.Eclipse always prompts that the new filename already exists, and askswhether you want to overwrite it.This happens in the case of a filenamethat does not already exist.When you choose to overwrite the nonexistent resource, an error dialogtells you that there were problems attempting to rename.Details revealthat the original filename does not exist.!?!From this point, Eclipse either removes the file entirely or has the text\"ERROR\"in the editor when you attempt to open the file.I could not reproduce this behavior with F3 on Linux."}
