{"bug_id": "76798", "title": "Bug 76798Add versions to woven class files  enabling better backwards compatibility.", "description": "We don't currently include a version in the class files that come out of theweaver.This can cause problems.For example, if we add a new attribute to aclass file in a future version of AspectJ, then that attribute will cause olderversions of AspectJ to blow up if they encounter it.If we include a version inthe class file we can rev the version number when we add attributes (or changethe class file form in another way), and by checking that version number in theweaver we can better determine whether we should fail if we encounter a newattribute (or other change), or if it is safe to continue processing.I will add a new WeaverVersion attribute that includes 2 shorts.Major and Minor.Encountering a major version in a class file that is greater than the version aparticular weaver is designed to understand will cause compilation to fail.Encountering a minor version in a class file that is greater than the minorversion a particular weaver is designed to understand will not cause compilationto fail  we will assume it is safe to continue."}
