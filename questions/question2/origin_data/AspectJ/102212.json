{"bug_id": "102212", "title": "Bug 102212[itds] abstract synchronized: compile error expected", "description": "when using intertype declaration, the compiler doesn't check for illegalmodifier combinations such as \"abstract synchronized\".another manifestation of this problem is when using intertype declaration to adda synchronized method to an interface. the problem is more severe in this casebecause conceptually, this method is not abstract at all.interface Interface {}abstract class Parent {}class Child extends Parent implements Interface {}aspect Bug {// illegal modifier combination not caught by ajcpublic abstract synchronized void Parent.abstract();public synchronized void Child.abstract() {}// the following has the same effect, but is easier to misspublic / implicit abstract / synchronized void Interface.interface() {}// use Child to make java complain: \"illegal modifiers: 0x421\"// (this corresponds to \"public abstract synchronized\")public static void main(String[] args) {new Child();}}"}
