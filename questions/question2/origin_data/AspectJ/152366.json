{"bug_id": "152366", "title": "Bug 152366LTW Within Patterns Should Accept AND For Consistency", "description": "The loadtime weaving definition system accepts AND in addition to &amp;&amp; for pointcuts, but it silently accepts and then fails to work with type patterns that use AND. Such type patterns are important when creating exceptions (e.g., excluding weblogic.. &amp;&amp; !weblogic.jdbc..) and using AND is also helpful here.I've attached a patch to support this and tests to show it's working."}
