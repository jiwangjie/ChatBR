{"bug_id": "73895", "title": "Bug 73895unnecessary cast causing problems", "description": "class: org.aspectj.weaver.ResolvedTypeX$Namemethod: isCoerceableFrom(..)I am having trouble with the line:ResolvedMember[] b = ((Name)other).getDeclaredMethods(); //??? is this castalways safeAs the comment suggests this cast is NOT always safe. In my case the cast is notsafe because I have some additional implementations for ResolvedTypeX (someoptimizations).Solution: just remove the cast since the method \"getDeclaredMethods\" is alreadydefined abstract in the type of \"other\" (ResolvedTypeX). So the cast seems to beobsolete anyway."}
