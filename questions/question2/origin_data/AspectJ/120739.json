{"bug_id": "120739", "title": "Bug 120739LTW Optimization: Disable World if it has No Aspects", "description": "This optimization disables weaving for a ClassLoader where there are no aspects defined. This is actually useful if you have aspect exclusions that exclude all the aspects defined in a parent class loader. It is also helpful in the trivial/rare case where there is an aop.xml definition with no aspect definitions."}
