{"bug_id": "88652", "title": "Bug 88652an array type as the last parameter in a signature does not match on the varargs declared method", "description": "I get this warning in my code, though I actually do not specify an array type.The signature I want to match is the following constructor signature:public Touple(Object formulaHandle, Object... propositions) {...}Touple implements IRelationThe pointcut I use is the following:pointcut p(): call(Touple.new(..));This should actually match the signature, shouldn't it?AspectJ however complains with this warning:an array type as the last parameter in a signature does not match on the varargsdeclared method: void ltlrv.Touple.<init(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object[])[Xlint:cantMatchArrayTypeOnVarargs]Also, even if I had stated an array type, it should match even then IMHO,since arrays and varargs are actually the same in the Java implementation."}
