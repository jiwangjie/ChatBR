{"bug_id": "155238", "title": "Bug 155238Trace should use System.identityHashCode, not hashCode", "description": "The tracing module uses obj.hashCode() to identify untrusted objects when formatting. I think it would be a little safer and more accurate to useSystem.identityHashCode(obj). This way the tracing code wouldn't call any applicationdefined code, and would give a value that can't change if the loader state changes."}
