{"bug_id": "88900", "title": "Bug 88900Unnecessary warning for ITDs", "description": "Consider the following aspect:public aspect RunnableDefaultImpl {public void Runnable.run() {}}(Note that it makes little sense to have a default implementation for Runnable. However, I am using it to allow easy reproduction of the bug.)Compiling this aspect leads to the following warning:...\\test\\RunnableDefaultImpl.aj:9 [warning] this affected type is not exposed to the weaver: java.lang.Runnable [Xlint:typeNotExposedToWeaver]public void Runnable.run() {^^^This warning isn't really necessary as weaver doesn't (and shouldn't) needto have Runnable exposed. In fact, everything works as expected already.Now it will be a good warning (or even error), if I was trying to introduce anew method, such as in the following aspect:public aspect RunnableDefaultImpl {public void Runnable.walk() {}}"}
