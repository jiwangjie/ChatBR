{"bug_id": "102459", "title": "Bug 102459provide more detail in showWeaveInfo messages", "description": "When advice is executed, the object you have to work with is the joinpoint. Thiscan then be queried to get various information out of it. It would be nice, ifas part of the weaving you could get hold of the same information.This is particularly useful in the case of writing a coverage tool. In order tomeasure where you've been, you have to know all the places you could possiblygo. The introduction of the showWeaveInfo option means that we can record theseplaces, however, this would be greatly enhanced by providing similar informationas to that which is collected as the program is running.The information which would be good is the same as that obtained fromJoinPoint.StaticPart.getSignature().toLongString()."}
