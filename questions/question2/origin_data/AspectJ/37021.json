{"bug_id": "37021", "title": "Bug 37021source path wrong in declare warning on binary files", "description": "In declare warning messages when targeting .class files from injars, the sourcepath is listed in the form \"app.Main.class\" rather than \"app/Main.[java|aj]\".See tests/new/binaryWarnings/.. for code to run to see the problem.Limitations of the tests: These tests return false positives when detecting this error because filenamechecking is not enabled in harness verification of messages. I have also see the filenames not appear at all, but these tests do notreproduce that problem.(I saw it in AJDT, so perhaps if the filename makes nosense to AJDT, AJDT simply omits it.)"}
