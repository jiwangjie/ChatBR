{"bug_id": "129525", "title": "Bug 129525Don't Dump Bytecodes to Syserr in LTW", "description": "The loadtime weaving system can produce truly massive quantities of output when there's a weaving error, since the system dumps the bytecode to syserr. It would be much better to produce an ajcore file and just point to it, or use some other log."}
