{"bug_id": "75568", "title": "Bug 75568ajc changes classfile timestamps even if compilation fails (regression)", "description": "It appears that ajc 1.2 updates a classfile timestamps even if the compilationfails. This breaks the integration with the Ant build system. E.g. using theant \"javac\" task with the Ajc11CompilerAdapter interface, the compilation mayfail on the first attempt and succeed on the second attempt,  because ajc hastouched the timestamp and Ant hence decides that nothing needs to be recompiled.This did not happen in ajc 1.1.To reproduce:1. In the examples/observer folder, run a build: ajc sourceroots .2. Edit the \"Demo.java\" class and insert the line \"DONT COMPILE\"3. Run the compilation again. The compiler displays the correct error messagebut the Demo.class file has been updated with the compiletime timestamp."}
