{"bug_id": "261808", "title": "Bug 261808iajcAntTask fails \"type already defined\"", "description": "Created attachment 123223 [details]Eclipseprojectexport that demonstrates the errorAs attachment you find a simple EclipseProject, which reproduces the error. The projectstructure consists of two packages \"anttest\" and \"anttest.test\". The second package should not be included in the build, so I was trying to exclude it using a dirset. This does not work, because with this configuration iajc always fails with an \"already defined\"error for every type (class or aspect).As comment I included a simple workaround for this problem in the iajctask. This workaround does its job, but I want to reuse the sourcepathdefinition, which is not possible this way."}
