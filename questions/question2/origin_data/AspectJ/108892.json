{"bug_id": "108892", "title": "Bug 108892Load Time Weaving problem with Aspect Definition at 2 Levels of Hierarchy", "description": "I am trying to weave into Tomcat with a systemlevel aspect (METAINF/aop.xmlis found in a jar on the system classpath), and also have a Web applicationwith an aop.xml properly deployed. When I try to run them both together, onlythe systemlevel aspects work. If I remove the systemlevel aspect jar from theclasspath, the applicationlevel aspects work. What would be a reasonable wayto isolate this into a test case? If I could package up a simple system.jar andapp.war file for Tomcat 5.5.9, would that be useful for you to use in debuggingit? I tried making a simple standalone version with 2 aop.xml files in the sameapp classloader but that works just fine."}
