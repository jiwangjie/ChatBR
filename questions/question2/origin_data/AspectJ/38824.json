{"bug_id": "38824", "title": "Bug 38824Anomalous handling of intertype declarations to abstract base classes in aspectj 1.1", "description": "Version 1.1 of aspectj does not handle correctly intertype declarations toabstract base classes.This appears when the following pattern is present in the code:Suppose there is an interface InterfaceA, another interface InterfaceB and athird interface InterfaceC extending InterfaceA and InterfaceB and containingsome method declarations of its own.Suppose also there is an aspect AConcretisingAspect that contains intertypedeclarations providing default implementations for all InterfaceC's methods(both own and inherited).Now suppose we have a class hierarchy emanating from an abstract classBaseClass, and an aspect BaseClassAspect declaring that BaseClass implementsInterfaceC:aspect BaseClassAspect {declare parents: BaseClass implements InterfaceC;}Unfortunately, during compilation iajc complains for each offspring of BaseClassthat it does not implement any of the abstract methods of InterfaceA andInterfaceB (but not of InterfaceC's own!).This does not happen when BaseClass is not abstract; and it does not occur inversion 1.0.6 of aspectj."}
