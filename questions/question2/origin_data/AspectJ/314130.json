{"bug_id": "314130", "title": "Bug 314130[plan] [ltw] [hcr] LTW, Reweaving and Hot Code Replace changes reflected every two saves of files", "description": "Build Identifier: AspectJ 1.6.9.M2 (Eclipse 3.5.1 Build ID: 200909201017)A full description of the bug is in the AspectJUsers mail list:http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/aspectjusers/msg12114.htmlWhile debugging if I change the content of a method (ex. the text of a System.out) and save the file, it wouldn't reflected. But if I save the save file again, this time the changes are reflected. And it repeats on cycles of two saves.The rare is that when I save and the changes are not reflected, in log appears the next two lines and when I save the file and changes are reflected this lines are not showed:[AppClassLoader@2bbd86] info processing reweavable type test.weaved.Test: test\\weaved\\Test.java[AppClassLoader@2bbd86] info successfully verified type test.aspects.TestAspect exists.Originates from test\\aspects\\TestAspect.javaThis lines comes from the method processReweavableStateIfPresent(String, BcelObjectType) on the class org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelWeaverSetting Xset:overWeaving=true was worst because every time that I save the file that is aspected I get this message from Eclipse in a popup: \"Hot code replace failed  Scheme change not implemented\" and the changes are never reflected, neither in the first save nor in the second save.My environment is:Windows XP SP3 32 bitsSun Java 1.6.0 Update 19 JDKEclipse 3.5.1 Build ID: 200909201017AspectJ 1.6.9 M2 (the same occurs with 1.6.8)Project: A clean new basis java project that only has this test and AspectJWeaver options: Xreweavable verbose showWeaveInfo debug (and also Xset:overWeaving=true in some tests)Using: javaagent:aspectjweaver1.6.9.M2.jarI will attach the test project that I used to isolate and reproduce this bug.Reproducible: AlwaysSteps to Reproduce:1. Import the attached project into Eclipse2. Run the project with the Main.launch that is in the project root.3. Modify the method print() in the class test.weaved.Test (ex. uncomment a line)4. See the console log. The changes are not reflected in the behavior.5. Modify again the method print() in the class test.weaved.Test (ex. uncomment another line)6. See the console log. Now the changes are reflected in the behavior.7. The same occurs whatever you change (obviously with the limits of the Hot Code Replace imposed by the JDK)"}
