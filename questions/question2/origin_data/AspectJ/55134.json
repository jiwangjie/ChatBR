{"bug_id": "55134", "title": "Bug 55134Incremental compilation does not delete weavergenerated class files", "description": "During incremental compilation, AjState records classes generated from sourcefiles following the initial compile phase, but before weaving. (So that thesecan be passed to the weaver on a subsequent iteration if we need to reweave theworld). During weaving of a given class file, the weaver may generate additionalclass files (for e.g. around closures) that get written to the output. If theorginal source file is deleted, these additional weaver generated classes arenot deleted from the output since AjState does not know about them."}
