{"bug_id": "150271", "title": "Bug 150271Allow multiple levels of LTW information", "description": "It would be nice if basic information about loadtime weaving (what version of AspectJ is being used, what loaders are doing weaving and what configuration is being used) was available without all of the verbose information listing of all classes woven or not woven.It's also unfortunate that the flags for weaving level are 2 quite different ones:Daj.weaving.verbose Dorg.aspectj.weaver.showWeaveInfoWhy not something like Dorg.aspectj.weaver.level=[none|summary|info|verbose]summary: just what configuration is usedinfo: list affected join points etc. (like showWeaveInfo)verbose: all (like verbose now)"}
