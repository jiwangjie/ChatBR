{"bug_id": "72531", "title": "Bug 72531declare warning warns at wrong points", "description": "I have a \"declare warning\" declaration that warns on usage of any method thatreturns an array of any POJO type, this should point to the methods that inreality return an array, but i see warnings at points other than these arrayreturning methods, and also those that have void in their signature. In theattached files i get a warning at statements like:PrinterWorld p = new PrinterWorld();[in main()method]System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");return new Integer(3);and these being the first/only lines in their respective methods."}
