{"bug_id": "50776", "title": "Bug 50776fail in compiling aspect with overriding method introduction with different throws clause", "description": "A first class (class A) declares only one method with some exceptions in thethrows clause ( void m() throws Exception ).A second class (class B) extends it without redefinig the method.An aspect declares a method introduction in the class B, with the same name,signature and return type of the one in class A, but without throws clause; thisis a legal override.In the second class (class B) each invocation to the overriden method doesn'tneed a trycatch block, because it refers to his hown method that raises noexception.This code compiles usingajc version 1.0.6 (built Jul 24, 2002 6:21 PM PST) running on java 1.4.0But not usingAspectJ Compiler 1.1.1AspectJ Compiler 1.1.0class A{public A(){}public void m() throws Exception{}}class B extends A{public B(){}public void somecode(){m();}}aspect C{public void B.m(){}}"}
