{"bug_id": "419279", "title": "Bug 419279ajc option to change Xlint level permessage without Xlintfile", "description": "The Xlintfile option is not a great fit for controlling message across multiple build projects, specifically in my case from the pluginManagement section of a maven parent pom. The problem is that you need a local file to configure the permessage output levels (ignore/warning/error) when you really want to specify it in the build script or in a shared file.As an alternative to Xlintfile, it would be handy to be able to change an Xlint warning level per message using command line options.For example:ajc Xlint:adviceDidNotMatch=ignorewould override the XlintDefault.properties file for the adviceDidNotMatch message.With RegardsRob"}
