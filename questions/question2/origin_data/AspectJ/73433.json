{"bug_id": "73433", "title": "Bug 73433AspectJ does not correctly support cp", "description": "Discovered by Andy Brodie.cp is a shorthand for classpath supported by the JDT compiler.AspectJ doesnot correctly support cp option.Look at this example:C:\\aspectj1.2ajc inpath injar.jar outjar outjar.jar cp lib\\aspectjrt.jar[error] can't find type org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint1 errorC:\\aspectj1.2ajc inpath injar.jar outjar outjar.jar classpath lib\\aspectjrt.jarThis is due to the arg parser in AspectJ only recognizing classpath.Itdoesn't fail when it encounters cp, it just ignores it and passes it down toJDT for processing.The fix is to recognize cp too."}
