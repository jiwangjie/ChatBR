{"bug_id": "21958", "title": "Bug 21958  ControlExample FileDialog does not filter correctly", "description": "The FileDialog created in the Dialog tab has extensions and filter names set  but these are not working correctly.  Delete the entry in File name field Set the filter to Doc files and go to a folder with *.doc files.  You will see  the folders but not the files. Same is true for all the other filters.  I set the file name field to \"*.doc\" then I see the doc files.  I noted that  this occurs even if the file extension field is set to something else such as  Batch Files.  I noted that the extension for .txt has an extra period after ie (\".txt.\") but  removing this still does not fix the dialog behaviour.  I also noted that on GTK and Motif the filters do not seem to apply at all.  It  should be noted in the javadoc for FileDialog.setFilterExtensions etc that  these filters are not applied on all platforms."}
