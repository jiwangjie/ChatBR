{"bug_id": "32770", "title": "Bug 32770  Java application launch shortcut error doesn't help user", "description": "1. Open a java file containing a main method. 2. Select a non-resource-based view (such as the Debug view). 3. Click Debug As->Java Application. 4. A dialog appears: \"Launch failed: no main type found\".  We should consider tracking resource selection the way external tools tracks selection for variable expansion (in fact, we should be able to combine the two into a single mechanism?). Also, we should improve the quality of the error message. The message should give the user a hint about what they need to do to fix the problem - in this case, they need to select a resource. The message should say something like \"Launch failed: No file with a main type selected\""}
