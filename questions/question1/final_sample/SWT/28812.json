{"bug_id": "28812", "title": "Bug 28812  Mouse cursor changes to arrow after hovering a hyperlinked indentifier", "description": "This bug occurred only after installing M4.  When using the new feature (from M3 I think) of pressing Ctrl and moving the  mouse over a Java indentifier to activate it as a hyperlink, the mouse cursor  changes from the usual text caret to a \"hand\". That is as expected. However,  once you release the Ctrl-key, the mouse cursor changes to an arrow and not  back to the text caret as expected. This arrow persists inside the same editor  untill you close it. This bug can always be reproduced.  I have seen the same bug in other situations than the one described above. But  I have not figured out exactly what caused it.  I know this may be a trivial bug to some people. But it simply annoys me so  much that I avoid using the otherwise really cool hyperlink feature."}
