{"bug_id": "17292", "title": "Bug 17292  Inconsistent Undo behaviour for Cut/Copy/Paste in outline", "description": "Build 20020521 (freeze 1)  1) Open a java editor on some class 2) In the content outline, select a method and do Ctrl+X to cut 3) Notice in the menus, Edit->Undo and Refactor->Undo are disabled 4) Now select the type node in the content outline, and Ctrl+V to paste 5) Still, neither Undo action is enabled 6) Now click inside the editor area to give it focus. 7) Now \"Edit->Undo\" is possible.  So, the problems are:  1) Undo is not consistent, it's available for Paste but not Cut. 2) Even when undo is possible, it only becomes enabled when the editor is  activated."}
