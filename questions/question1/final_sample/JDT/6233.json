{"bug_id": "6233", "title": "Bug 6233  keep property value if IPropertySource.getEditableValue returns null", "description": "If IPropertySource is appearing in the property sheet as the value of a property of some other IPropertySource then the source is asked for getEditableValue. If the returned value is null, then the PropertySheetEntry should use the original value, and not null value.  For example, my PropertySource contains a property with value of type jdt.IType. The PropertySource for IType returns null in getEditableValue, and this null is actually used by PropertySheetEntry as the edit value;  the consequence is that CellEditor provided in PropertyDescriptor of the property does not work.  @see PropertySheetEntry#getEditValue"}
