{"bug_id": "16858", "title": "Bug 16858  Preceding space in package compression pattern sometimes ignored", "description": "(In the following discussion, all patterns were entered without the  enclosing quote marks.)  The pattern \"1 \" causes one character of each package name to be  displayed with a single space separator between them.  The pattern \" 1 \" causes one space to precede the first single-character  package name and two spaces to appear between each one.  Both of the above cases were expected. However, if you set the patttern to  \" 1\" (i.e. space before, but no space after), no spaces are displayed in the  result."}
