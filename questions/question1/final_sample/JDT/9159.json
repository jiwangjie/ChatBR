{"bug_id": "9159", "title": "Bug 9159  Classpath wizard should not complain when adding missing source folder", "description": "Build 20020125  - Define a project A with source folder 'src1'.  - Go to the .classpath file and edit it to insert one extra line: <classpathentry kind=\"src\" path=\"src2\"/> below the line referring to first  source folder: <classpathentry kind=\"src\" path=\"src1\"/>. - Now, try to add this missing source folder 'src2', it isn't allowed by the  wizard, one has to add a basic folder instead.  Note: It is not such an uncommon scenario, the classpath modification could  simply occur by catching up with a shared classpath having one more source  folder on it, and which is locally missing."}
