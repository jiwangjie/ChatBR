{"bug_id": "5231", "title": "Bug 5231  Add search for field read and write references", "description": "The UI should support the following new JDT Core feature: Search for field read and field write references. Two new constants have been  added on IJavaSearchConstants to be used when creating a field reference search  pattern:     - READ_REFERENCES: the search results contain *only* read access to a field.     - WRITE_REFERENCES: the search results contain *only* write access to a  field.  If REFERENCES is used, then search results contain both read and write accesss  to a field."}
