{"bug_id": "9015", "title": "Bug 9015  Organize imports feature finds errors in assert statements", "description": "Eclipse version 2.0, build 20020125, Windows, installed JDK1.4RC3 from Sun,  used as external compiler, Compilation settings Java 1.4 (source and bytecode).  When I use asserts of the form  assert xx != null; in the code and try to invoke the Organize Imports feature, I get an error Compilation unit has syntax errors: Line <someline>: Syntax error on token \"!=\", \",\", \";\" expected. The class runs fine and shows no errors / warnings otherwise. Organize imports work fine if I place assert expression in brackets, like this: assert (xx != null);"}
