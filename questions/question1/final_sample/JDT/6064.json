{"bug_id": "6064", "title": "Bug 6064  Open on selection shouldn't require selection", "description": "Build 20011116  - move the text insertion point into the middle of a type name in a Java editor - press F3 - it has no effect  It would be better if it opened on the current word.  (I notice that it currently works for a partial selection, if the selection  includes the start of the type name, as if it's doing code-assist or something.)  This is an issue for keyboard accessibility.  It currently requires you to move  the cursor to the start of the word, hit CTRL+SHIFT+RIGHT to select the word,  then F3.  It would be better if you could just move to the word and hit F3."}
