{"bug_id": "8757", "title": "Bug 8757  Type Hierarchy view - Error decoration not removed when error fixed", "description": "Eclipse 200201129-I Windows 2000  1) Focus on the hierarchy of class (one that has a few super classes). 2) Cause a compile error to happen in the class and save the change. 3) Select a different class in the hierarchy and then select the class with   the error.  Note that now the label at the top of the methods list in the  TypeHierarchy view nows has a red x on it.  I don't know why you have to flip  between classes to make this red x appear - it should appear as soon as you  save the change that caused a compile error. 4) Now fix the compile error and save the change.  The red x does not disappear  from the label above the methods list."}
