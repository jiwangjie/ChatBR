{"bug_id": "8595", "title": "Bug 8595  'Open super implementation' should be disabled", "description": "In the Outline view, there seems to be a new menu item 'Open super  implementation', and a corresponding decoration on methods to indicate thet  they have a super implementation.  The UI already knows if the method has a super implementation, so it should  disable the menu item when there is no super implementation to open to.   Currently it just does nothing if you select a method with no super  implementation.  (Tested against 20020125 build)"}
