{"bug_id": "6191", "title": "Bug 6191  Should be able to select contents of string", "description": "In a previous version of Eclipse, and in VAJ, and in VAME, I could double-click  inside a Java string and select the whole string. This is handy for replacing  the text in the string. For example, if you have a string \"This is a pretty long string and it is incorrect\" then you could double-click in between the first \" and the T or after the last t and before the end \" and the whole string would be selected. Currently, double-click only selects between brackets. It should select  between \"s as well. Try it in VAJ or VAME to see what I mean."}
