{"bug_id": "8280", "title": "Bug 8280  Package view back/forward/up arrow hover help", "description": "Start up Eclipse with some existing Java Projects in the workspace. Select a package in one of these projects. Right-click and select Go Into. Hover over the Back arrow. Notice that a very tall tool-tip (full screen height) text appears, the first line being \"Back to Java Model\" and the remaining lines being package names (?).  Immediately after being displayed, the tool-tip text disappears.  The text will flash into and out of existance consitently until the pointer leaves the button's frame.  The same behaviour can occur when hovering over the Up arrow or the Forward arrow when these lead to the workspace root."}
