{"bug_id": "3968", "title": "Bug 3968  Rename refactoring for overridden methods should be more supportive (1GFAYM4)", "description": "EG (6/14/01 10:46:47 AM) \t1) try to renaming a method that is overridden from a base class \t2) the precondition check tells me that I should do this in the most abstract class. \tI'm not told what this abstract class is. If we can't compute it easily we should \toffer to open the type hierarchy on this type.  NOTES:  AK (8/15/2001 4:14:27 PM) \twaiting for: 1GII6W0: ITPJCORE:WINNT - search for method declarations in hierarchy does not work as expected"}
