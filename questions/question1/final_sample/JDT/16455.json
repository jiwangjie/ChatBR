{"bug_id": "16455", "title": "Bug 16455  Open type in hierarchy perspective. [type hierarchy]", "description": "I use open type dialog a lot to open the type in a hierarchy perpective but I can't find the preference to open the type in a hierarchy perpective anymore.  I saw the button \"Hierarchy\" in the open type dialog but takes me 4 tabs to get  there instead of pressing enter. (Not acceptable).  Please can you point me to the new preference if it exists. Or can you give a  way to make the Hierarchy button the default button.  For example: If I press it once, it becames the active next time the dialog is  opened."}
