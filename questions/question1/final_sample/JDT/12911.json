{"bug_id": "12911", "title": "Bug 12911  Open Type dialog doesn't always combine types with same name", "description": "Build 20020321  Create the following three classes:  bar.FOO baz.Foo quux.FOO  Now open the 'Open Type' dialog, and type in 'foo'.  The list will have three entries in it:  +-----+ | FOO | | Foo | | FOO | +-----+  This is incorrect.  The two 'FOO' entries should be combined, and the list  should look like:  +-----+ | FOO | | Foo | +-----+  I suspect that this is due to a compare function which doesn't distinguish  between strings which only differ by case, causing them to appear in an  arbitrary order in a sorted list."}
