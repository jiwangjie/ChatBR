Create a class C as follow:  package jp1;  public class C { \tprivate int id; }  2. Close it and mark it as read only 3. Reopen it and you should not be able to modify anything 4. From the outline view, select \"id - int\" and right mouse click and  select \"Create getter and setter\". 5. The class becomes  package jp1;  public class C { \tprivate int id; \t/** \t * Gets the id. \t * @return Returns a int \t */ \tpublic int getId() { \t\treturn id; \t}  \t/** \t * Sets the id. \t * @param id The id to set \t */ \tpublic void setId(int id) { \t\tthis.id = id; \t}  }     and the editor is dirty, but you cannot save it until clear the read-only  flag."}
