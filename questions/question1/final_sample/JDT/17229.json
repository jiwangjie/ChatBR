{"bug_id": "17229", "title": "Bug 17229  Java prefs - build preferences should be merged back with compiler ones", "description": "Build 20020521  Unless people understand our implementation, it is counter-intuitive for them  to look under the 'builder' section for concerns which are still roughly  compiler related...  Here are some options (from Erich): 1) make builder a subnode of compiler \t- easy to do \t- not consistent with existing tab approach  2) squeeze it onto the first tab and rename it \t- dialog might get higher \t- need another title  3) add another tab \"Building\"  (need a better name) \t- we would have the space to do so"}
