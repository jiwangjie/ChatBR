{"bug_id": "2312", "title": "Bug 2312  [Perspective] Need to show something when all views closed (1GENTGJ)", "description": "If you close all the views in the perspective, it remains open, but looks very bare, and it's not clear what the user can do next.  Simply closing the perspective is one option, though it might be surprising. Another would be to show a view which lets you navigate to other perspectives, or close this one.  This is particularly bad for the Help perspective, since it only contains one view. Clicking the help view's close button is a natural thing to do when done with the help.  NOTES:  DS (6/6/01 11:39:44 AM) \tWe can pop up a dialog asking the user what they want to do .. \t\t1. Close perspective. \t\t2. Do nothing. \tIt would also be good to have a disable button on the dialog, as in \"do not show again\".  DS (6/6/01 3:07:35 PM) \tBasic implementation, sans dialog, in \t\t>WorkbenchPage 0.119 [ds] 05"}
