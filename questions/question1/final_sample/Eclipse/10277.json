{"bug_id": "10277", "title": "Bug 10277  Editor reuse not consistent", "description": "If editors are opened with activate==true then the last/oldest editor is reused but if the editors are opened with activate==false then the newest editor is reused. This is not what I would expect.  Test case: 1. Set the editor threshold to 3 for Workbench and for Java Browsing (Preferences -> Java -> Work in Progress -> Browsing). 2. In Java perspective open A.java, B.java, C.java and then D.java 3. In Java Browsing perspective open A.java, B.java, C.java and then D.java ==> The Java perspective contains B.java, C.java and D.java while Java Browsing perspective contains A.java, B.java and D.java"}
