{"bug_id": "19981", "title": "Bug 19981  Problems with accelerators in emacs mode", "description": "Build 20020611 + latest org.eclipse.ui changes  - switch to emacs key bindings - open a text file, e.g. Test.java  Many menu items have incorrect accelerator text. This is a regression.  This worked properly in 20020611 (mostly, see below).  File menu: - Close - has Ctrl+X Ctrl+K but is missing Ctrl+F4 - Save - missing Ctrl+X Ctrl+S - Save All (not a problem, but could use Ctrl+X S, like Epsilon) - Print - shows Ctrl+P even though this is bound to previous line  Edit menu: - Undo and Redo are blank - Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All, Find have default accelerator text  In 20020611, there are different problems: - Project / Rebuild All shows Ctrl+B even though it's bound to back character. In 20020611+latest, it is blank (correct). - Debug actions Run to Line, Run Snippet, Display, Inspect show wrong  accelerator text"}
