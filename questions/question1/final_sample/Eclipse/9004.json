{"bug_id": "9004", "title": "Bug 9004  Editor rearranges its location by itself", "description": "stable: 20020125  Normal Steps Leading Up To It: 1   Open an editor on A.txt 2   Go to the windows file system, and edit A.txt (and save your change). 3   Go back to eclipse 4   Click on the outline view 5   Click on editor tab of A.txt  6   You will get prompted to load the changs made to the file. 7   Say YES 8   The file editor correctly updates  Auto Move 9   Now take your mouse cursor and \"wave\" it over the editor tab. As it gets  over the tab it will auto start an undock/rearrange of the editor.  (I suspect it is happening because the initial click on the editor tab (5) was  interrupted by the dialog asking to update and it assumed the elapsed time was  a click down - ie drag)."}
