{"bug_id": "16199", "title": "Bug 16199  new welcome page presentation", "description": "Notes from a discussion with Kevin H before lunch:  The workbench should have a Help -> \"Getting Started\" menu item that opens a  dialog of some sort; the dialog presents a list of all features with a welcome  page (\"welcomePage\" property in feature's plug-in's about.ini file) and  affords the user some way to make a single selection. The selected feature's  welcome page is then presented in the editor.  The new property (in a feature's plug-in's about.ini file) will be  called \"welcomePerspective\". The value is the id of the perspective that this  feature would like its welcome page to open up in.  This property is optional;  if not specified, the feature isn't picky."}
