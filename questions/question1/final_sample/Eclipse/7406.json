{"bug_id": "7406", "title": "Bug 7406  NPE: adaptable and filters don't work together for property page contributions", "description": "If a property page contribution is filtered by project nature, and its marked  as adaptable, the filter is ignored for the adapted case.  Specifically, our  CVS property page shows up on non-CVS Java Projects.  As a result, the following steps in our 2.0 work will cause a NPE:  1. Open the property dialog on a Java project in the Packages view which hasn't  yet been connected to a CVS repository (so no CVS nature). 2. You will erroneously have a CVS page. Go to the CVS page but dont make any  changes. 3. Go to another page, make a change, Finish.  You will get a NPE from the CVS properties page finish because the project  isn't a CVS project and the page should never have been there."}
