{"bug_id": "17758", "title": "Bug 17758  [Navigator] Navigator View. Problems with 'Go Into' action", "description": "from a clean F1 build, import all plugins from runtime environment to get some projects pack a project (say org.eclipse.ant) go into, go up, go back, go back, works fine. close the project. forward is still enabled, but the first forward goes to a blank screen. perhaps  closing projects should clean up the history, or some text should appear in  navigator view such as 'project is closed' further problem: having some history now, open up another project (say  org.eclipse.lucene) and select a folder (say 'bin') 'Go Into' is enabled. Click  it and it doesn't seem to do anything. Click forward then back. Notice now 'Go  Into' is disabled."}
