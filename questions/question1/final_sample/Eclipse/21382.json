{"bug_id": "21382", "title": "Bug 21382  [Dialogs] Java Build Path properties page freezes UI during compile [general issue]", "description": "Build 2.0 release  When a change is made on the Java Build Path peroperty page, and the user clicks on OK, the progress monitor is opened while the current project compiles. However, the compile is run in the UI thread, so the UI is unresponsive during the compile.  Windows appears to handle the case rather well, since changes to the dialog's messages are displayed on screen. However, Linux GTK does not fare as well. The compile displays as a completely blank progress monitor (the progress indicator does work however).  The offending code appears to be in BuildPathsPropertyPage.performOK where ProgressMonitorDialog.run is called with fork=false."}
