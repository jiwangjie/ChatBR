{"bug_id": "15488", "title": "Bug 15488  EditorActionBars and switching between perspectives problem", "description": "Build 0502 with UI dev stream.  1. Close all perspectives. 2. Open a CVS Repository perspective.  Hide editors. 3. Open a Resources perspective.  Open a *.java file. 4. Go to CVS Repository perspective by clicking on the perspective in the  shortcut bar. 5. Go to Resources perspective by clicking on the perspective in the shortcut  bar.  The editor action bar is there. 6. Repeat Step 4. 7. Repeat Step 5.  The editor action bar is not there.  In order to maintain the current position of the EditorActionBar when CoolBars  are used, the cool item (i.e., for the EditorActionBar) must be on the coolbar  when the layout is restored.  Otherwise, its position will be lost.  Why isn't  the editor action bar present in Step 7?"}
