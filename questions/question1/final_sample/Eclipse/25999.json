{"bug_id": "25999", "title": "Bug 25999  [Import/Export] Importing a second project with a name whose first few characters are similar to an existing one", "description": "hi, I have a project called \"XYZ\" in my workbench. I used to have another project  with the name \"XYZ_plugin\" which I had deleted from the workbench some time  ago. I found that I needed to refer to some classes on this XYZ_plugin project  and tried to use the File > Import wizard. In the text box where I needed to  point to the file-system location, as I typed XYZ_, the project name still  showed up as \"XYZ\" and so I got an error saying that there was already a  project existing with that name. Finally I had to create a new project and  point it at the location. But I think this is a bug."}
