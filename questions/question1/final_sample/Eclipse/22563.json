{"bug_id": "22563", "title": "Bug 22563  [Perspectives] View layout is tricky at edges", "description": "I've just had to \"redo\" a perspective the way I want it (for reasonable  reasons) and I've run into the same problem I always have. I wish to  have the search/console/tasks bar along the whole bottom width of  Eclipse. I should (I think) be able to do this by dragging a view over  the status bar and getting an \"up\" arrow to say I want it to be above  the status bar. Unfortunately, I can't do that - I have to put  everything vertically so that *everything* is the full width, get the  tasks/console/search in the right place and then reorganise the rest.  Have I missed something, or is this genuinely missing functionality?  (The same goes for the top, left and right as well - getting anything  that takes up a whole side is basically a pain.)"}
