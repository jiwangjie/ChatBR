{"bug_id": "19113", "title": "Bug 19113  [Navigator] F2 for Rename in Navigator conflicts with Java Editor", "description": "The Navigator uses F2 for Rename, while the Java Editor defines F2 as \"Show  Tooltip Description\".  One of them needs to go.  It's confusing because F2 does  a Rename in the Navigator unless you have a Java Editor open, *even though* the  Navigator view has focus.  If you're used to using F2 to rename a resource in  the Navigator, it will appear that the function is broken unless you know that  the reason it's not working is because you have a Java Editor open.  I know that accelerator keys are an unresolved issue in general, but at least  the base Eclipse components should not conflict with each other."}
