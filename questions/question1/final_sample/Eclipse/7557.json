View remains unresponsive until  Eclipse is restarted. Tested in both Java and Resource perspectives.  1. Launch a fresh Eclipse session. 2. Open a Properties view through Perspective->Show View->Properties, restore  the view if it appears as a fast view. 3. Drag the view to the shortcut bar to make it a fast view. 4. Click the icon in the shortcut bar to pop up the properties view. 5. Close the view. 6. Re-open the Properties view through Perspective->Show View->Properties 7. The view appears as a regular view, but does not respond to mouse movement  or clicks. All other views work normally. If Eclipse is closed and restarted  the Properties view shows up in the same location and now works normally."}
