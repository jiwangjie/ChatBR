{"bug_id": "2418", "title": "Bug 2418  [UI] Status line messgae remains after fastview is closed (1GF1RPI)", "description": "TM (6/9/2001 11:39:21) \tSDK 121  \t1) I was catching up with changes. I do this in a fastview of the \"synchronize\" view in the java \t\tperspective. \t2) when I was done, I clicked the fastview icon on the left workspace window border. \t3) the fastview closed  \t4) observe: I still could see the status line message fromt he synchronize view (No conflicts, ...)  NOTES:  SA (10/10/2001 2:23:44 PM) \tThis problem is still here in 0.202 build. It can be reproduced with any views. Once the fast view \tis hidden, no other view/editor is given focus.  \tThis should be fixed in the bigger context of proper focus & z-order handling. That is, focus \tshould go to the pevious part that had focus."}
