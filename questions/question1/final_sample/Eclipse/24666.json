{"bug_id": "24666", "title": "Bug 24666  [ViewMgmt] Switching perspectives shows fast view", "description": "build 20021009  Sometimes when I switch perspectives a fast view is shown in the perspective I  switch to. Scenario: -I'm debugging a program and hit a breakpoint.  -After stepping in the debugger a couple of times I switch to the Java  perspective. -The Java perspective will have one of my three fast views open (one of CVS  repositories, synchronize and CVS resource history) even though I did not open  a fast view before I switched to the debug perspective.  I've seen this twice since I'm running with the latest HEAD code. I don't have  a reproducable scenario (yet)."}
