{"bug_id": "16907", "title": "Bug 16907  [DND] Moving or copying a file to a different folder containing a file of the same name results in \"Copy of\" renaming", "description": "Using drag and drop, a file copied to the source directory is renamed by  appending \"Copy of \" to the filename. This makes sense.  If a file is copied or moved to a different directory and the destination  directory contains a file with the same name the copied file is renamed using  the same scheme. This does not seem to make sense. The file from the original  directory is not necessarily a copy of the file in the new directory. If the  source and destination directories are different and there is a name conflict,  a message should probably be displayed to the user asking if they would like to  replace the current file (or possibly rename the new file)."}
