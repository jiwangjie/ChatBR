{"bug_id": "14807", "title": "Bug 14807  Doing backward find/replace all causes infinite loop", "description": "Build 20020412  In an editor window, type the following:  a.b  Put the cursor at the end of the text. Select Edit->Find/Replace set the following dialog settings: Backward find: a. replace with: test.a.  Click Replace All  The editor will replace the \"a.\", but the insertion point will stay at the end  of the newly inserted text. It will then see \"test.a.b\" and do another replace,  giving \"test.test.a.b\", etc. The replace gets stuck in an infinite loop.  The only way to stop the process is to terminate the Eclipse process.  When doing a backward search/replace, the insert caret should be placed before  the newly replaced text to avoid this."}
