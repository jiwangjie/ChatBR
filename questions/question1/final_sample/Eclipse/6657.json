{"bug_id": "6657", "title": "Bug 6657  Project rename error message has a strange chars in the front", "description": "Found in V1.0 (R10 driver), and re-tested on v2.0  (Build 20011204).  Problem  exists in both places.  Tested on Windows 2000.  STEPS:  Create a simple project called Simple1.  Create a simple project called Simple2 In the resource perspective, rename Simple1 to Simple 2 from the  Navigator.  RESULTS: You will see the message     \"P/Simple2 exists.  Doyou wish to overwrite?\" EXPECTED RESULTS: See the message     \"Simple2 exists.  Doyou wish to overwrite?\"   without the P/ in the front.  NOTE: This does not happen in the Java Perspective (it brings up a dialog  instead of allowing renaming in-line).  PJCCMVC191629"}
