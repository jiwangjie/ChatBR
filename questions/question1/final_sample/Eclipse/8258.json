{"bug_id": "8258", "title": "Bug 8258  Error message not nice when view is missing on startup", "description": "If you remove a plugin that defined a view that was open on shutdown, you get an  unfriendly message just stating that an error occurred (see error log, etc).   For example, turn off the plugin org.eclipse.vcm.ui.  This case is common enough  that the error message should be more informative.  It should say which view it  failed to open, and explain that a component has been removed.  It should also  say that the error is not critical, and that the user can continue working with  that workbench.  Note this will happen for almost everyone who tries to go from  1.0 to 2.0 with an old workspace (because of removed debug and VCM views), so  the upgrade path should be more friendly."}
