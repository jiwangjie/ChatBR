{"bug_id": "11747", "title": "Bug 11747  Not enough info added to log on runtime exceptions in WorkspaceAction", "description": "Build 20020319  I'm trying to track down an exception that gets caught in WorkspaceAction.run.   The problem is, this method just logs the receiver class name and the  exception's toString.  It does not capture the exception's stack trace.  It  should create a status object with the exception inside it, then log that status  object.  That way the stack trace would get added to the log file.  A sample log  entry from the current build looks like the following, which really gives very  little interesting information:  Exception in org.eclipse.ui.actions.BuildAction. run:  java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException"}
