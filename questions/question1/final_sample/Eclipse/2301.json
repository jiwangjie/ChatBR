{"bug_id": "2301", "title": "Bug 2301  [Import/Export] No save prompt before exporting (1GENMDK)", "description": "(Not a serious issue) Before entering the export wizard, the user should be prompted to save their work.  There is a good chance the user is planning to export the file they are currently editing and could easily forget to save. If they are exporting, the user rarely checks the contents of the jar/zip so the exported work may not be what they desire.  Illustration: 1) open a .java file in a project 2) make some changes to the file, don't save 3) File->export (file system) 4) select the java file you were editing, export to your desktop 5) open the java file, note that your changes are not in the file    NOTES:"}
