{"bug_id": "17227", "title": "Bug 17227  [Dialogs] ElementTreeSelectionDialog should handle double click", "description": "Using Eclipse 2.0, Build F1 (buildid: 20020521)  on Windows 2000.  NOTE: Make sure you have a few java projects in your workspace (I just imported  a bunch).  From the Java perspective, go to Search, \"Customize..\", add NLS Keys. Now open the NLS Keys Tab and click on the second \"Browse\" button (for Property  file name).   You'll notice that the dialog title is \"Pr&operties File Selection\". Could you  please remove that ampersand '&'?  Also, in this same dialog, clicking on the \"+\" will expand the project folders,  but double clicking will not (and it should). I should also mention that this  dialog has a maximize icon enabled, and it is resizable. This is unlike all  other dialogs, and I'll let you decide whether or not this is important."}
