{"bug_id": "3970", "title": "Bug 3970  [preferences] UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files (1GFIOAX)", "description": "When creating a new file we currently use the line delimiter returned form System.getProperties(\"line.delimiter\"). But this is not \twhay a user always wants. Consider the following sceanrio:  \t\t- Unix and Windows work station used to develop a Unix product / program. \t\t- the Windows work stations are used as X terminals and to run Eclipse (since PC are cheaper than Unix boxes). \t\t- even if the new file is created on Windows it should have Unix line delimiters since the end product is a Unix product.  \tThere should be a UI (Preference) to define the line delimiter for new files. Possible values are:  \t\t- Dos / Windows \t\t- Mac \t\t- Unix \t\t- default platform line delimiter.  \tThe UI should be provided by the Workbench since all plugins should use the same line delimiter for new files.
