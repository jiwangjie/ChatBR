{"bug_id": "22274", "title": "Bug 22274  [DND] Navigator should not sync selection with editor on drag", "description": "If I have two resources A and B open in their editors, and I try to drag A into  B from the navigator view, I cannot.  The navigator will flip the active active  editor to A, making it impossible to drop on B.  It is possible to avoid this by checking the dragsourceevent.doit value during  the dragStart callback, and storing this value until the drag finished callback  has occurred.  If it is true, then a native drag is about to start.  The  mousedown or selection event should come after the dragStart event, and \"Link  navigator selection to active Editor\" can be suppressed."}
