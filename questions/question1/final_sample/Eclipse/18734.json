{"bug_id": "18734", "title": "Bug 18734  Problem with new preference import feature", "description": "Build 20020602 (F2)  I noticed a problem in how the UI handles the new preference import feature.   The code is as follows:  IStatus status = Preferences.validatePreferenceVersions(path);\t\t if (!status.isOK()) { \tErrorDialog.openError(...); \treturn;\t }  This is not the intended behaviour.  The status object returned by Core can have  severity OK, WARNING, or ERROR.  In the case of a warning, you want to give the  user the choice of whether or not they want to go ahead with the import.  They  may want to ignore minor compatibilty problems and go ahead with the import  anyway.  See the Preferences#validatePreferenceVersions javadoc for more  details."}
