{"bug_id": "26890", "title": "Bug 26890  [Dialogs] FilteredList - toggle case sensitivity after creation", "description": "Right now, one can define whether the FilteredList is \"case sensitive\" or \"case insensitive\" only at class creation.  I think one should be able to toggle the behavior after creation.  Class FilteredList is a public class and will be reused in different contexts -- in one of these context it might be useful to have an accompaning checkbox \"Case sensitive\" or adjust the case sensitivity in a dynamic way.  Right now there is no way but to rewrite class FilteredList to be able to support the checkbox ... fIgnoreCase is private and has no getter/setter-method ... so even a hypothetical subclass could not change the behavior.  see bug 23187 for an example (the descision on that bug has no impact on this feature request)"}
