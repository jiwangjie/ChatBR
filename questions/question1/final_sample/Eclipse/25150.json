{"bug_id": "25150", "title": "Bug 25150  [Dialogs] File property page has large vertical area on GTK", "description": "Build 20021018  There are a number of problems with the way the properties are displayed  for files: 1. The read-only text fields are displayed with a white background. By  convention, a white background tells the user that a text field is  editable. Non-editable text fields should be drawn with a gray background. 2. The text fields are not drawn with a border. The combination of a white  background and no border makes the fields look sloppy. 3. The text fields are poorly sized. The \"Path:\" and \"Location:\" fields are  too tall (vertically) and the \"Last Modified: field is too thin  (horizontally)."}
