{"bug_id": "7752", "title": "Bug 7752  Export multiple files with same file name under different directories to zip file fails.", "description": "Steps to reproduce: 1. Launch WSWB and create two projects 2. Under each project, create a new file with the same name (such as \"foo.txt\") 3. From the main-menu, Select File -> Export  and select Zip File to export 4. In the \"Export\" dialog window, Select both projects created earlier, give  the zip file a name (such as test.zip) and begin export to zip file.  Results: An error message box pops up: Problems were encountered during export and the  detail lists the file of the same name in project2 as the problem (i.e. foo.txt  in project 2).  If you name foo.txt in project 2 foo2.txt there are no problems.  Expected Behaviour: The zip file should be able to store files with same name under different  directories."}
