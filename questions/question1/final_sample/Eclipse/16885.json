{"bug_id": "16885", "title": "Bug 16885  Dismissing fast view should not unzoom other editors and views", "description": "Build 20020521  - zoom an editor - activate a fast view - dismiss the fast view - the editor is unzoomed  The tests are failing due to this problem. This was apparently introduced in the fix to fast view zooming. While more aggressively unzooming is better than corrupting the layout, we  previously tried to keep editors and other views zoomed when using a fast view.  Should only unzoom when dismissing a fast view if it's the fast view itself  that is zoomed.    (Even better would be to maintain separate zoom state for the fast views, but  that's a bigger change, and is too late to do for 2.0.)"}
