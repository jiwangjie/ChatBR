{"bug_id": "18335", "title": "Bug 18335  Perspective contents lost when view is maximized", "description": "All the contents of the perspective (views, layout info) is lost when the  following actions are performed in F1:  Maximize a view in any perspective. Switch to another perspective and exit the  workbench. Open the workbench and switch to the perspective with the maximized  view. Observe that only the maximized view is actually present and all other  views are missing from the perspective.  As far as I can remember, view maximize code replaced the page layout with a  temporary one that contained only the maximized view. This temporary layout  must be getting persisted instead of the proper layout when the workbench is  closed."}
