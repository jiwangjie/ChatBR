If you set it, and click on Apply, if you then click on Reset Defaults, it doesn't reset the check-box as unselected.  This may be a \"generic\" button, but in this context, the button should either  be removed or changed to \"Reset\" (which is defined as resetting those settings  to their value before the panel was entered, not the same as Undo).  The  button \"Reset Defaults\" doesn't make a lot of sense in this context.  I suppose  you could define the default read-only state as \"off\", then selecting the  button would systematically reset the read-only bit..."}
