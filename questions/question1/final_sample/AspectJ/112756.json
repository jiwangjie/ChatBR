{"bug_id": "112756", "title": "Bug 112756  ajdt compiler generate false warnings", "description": "I was working on aspect that should raise an error for junit test methods that didn't use any assertions. Apparently I had to use pointcut like \"call(void Assert+.assert*(..))\" on which ajdt compiler complained about using \"assert\" keyword. I don't think such warning should be shown in such case.  Anyway, here is the complete aspect code.   import junit.framework.Test; import junit.framework.Assert; import junit.framework.AssertionFailedError;   public aspect AssertionCounter {   private ThreadLocal counts = new ThreadLocal();    public pointcut testMethodExecution() :      execution(void Test+.test*());    public pointcut assertCall() :      cflow(testMethodExecution()) && call(void Assert+.assert*(..));         void around() : testMethodExecution() {     counts.set( new Counter());     proceed();     if(((Counter) counts.get()).getCount()==0) {       throw new AssertionFailedError(\"No assertions had been called\");     }   }    before() : assertCall() {     ((Counter) counts.get()).inc();   }    }"}
